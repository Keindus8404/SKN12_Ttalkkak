[00:23] me006 | OK .
[00:23] me013 | Sh - Close your door on door on the way out ? Thanks .
[00:23] me006 | Thanks .
[00:25] me006 | Oh .
"[00:39] mn007 | Uh , well , first there are perhaps these uh Meeting Recorder"
[00:44] mn007 | digits
[00:45] mn007 | that we tested . So .
[00:47] mn007 | Um .
[00:49] me013 | the SRI System and the oth And
[00:54] me013 | difference between having a lot of uh
[01:06] me013 | on
[01:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:12] me013 | And uh it 's significantly better than that , using"
[01:19] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:26] me013 | But that 's that 's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data ,"
[01:41] mn007 | Yeah . Right .
[01:47] me013 | is is doing the digits um
[01:50] me013 | the wor as a word model or as
[01:53] me013 | uh a sub s sub - phone states ?
[02:04] me013 | Yeah .
[02:14] mn007 | It 's their complete system and including on - line
[02:20] me013 | That 's true .
"[02:21] mn007 | And if you don't use adaptation , the error rate is"
[02:25] mn007 | around
"[02:27] mn007 | fifty percent worse , I think , if I remember . Yeah ."
[02:29] me013 | OK .
"[02:31] me013 | It 's tha it 's that much , huh ?"
[02:31] mn007 | Nnn .
[02:32] mn007 | It 's Yeah . It 's quite significant . Yeah .
[02:35] me013 | Oh . OK .
[02:37] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:45] me013 | take I guess that somebody 's gonna do this , right ? is to take some of these tandem things and feed it into the SRI system , right ?"
[02:51] mn007 | Yeah .
[02:52] me013 | Yeah .
[02:52] mn007 | We can do something like that . Yeah .
"[02:59] mn007 | I am not sure . Our back - end is is fairly simple but until now , well , the attempts"
"[03:07] mn007 | to improve it or have fail Ah , well , I mean"
[03:10] mn007 | uh what Chuck
[03:11] mn007 | tried
[03:12] mn007 | to to to do
[03:15] mn007 | Yeah . So it 's Yeah .
[03:23] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[03:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[03:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[03:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[03:38] mn007 | Mmm .
[03:38] me013 | And um .
"[03:41] mn007 | So , yeah , we could retrain"
[03:43] mn007 | some of these tandem
[03:52] mn007 | f for the HMM models . Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[03:53] me013 | much better H M Ms . Yeah .
[03:56] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:58] me013 | But just train those H M Ms using different features , the features coming from our Aurora stuff . So ."
[04:01] mn007 | Yeah .
[04:04] mn007 | Yeah .
"[04:08] mn007 | perhaps it 's not related , the amount of data but the um"
"[04:14] mn007 | it 's probably not a problem of noise , because"
[04:17] mn007 | our features are supposed to be robust to noise .
"[04:20] mn007 | It 's not a problem of channel , because there is"
"[04:20] me013 | Well , yeah ."
[04:23] mn007 | um
[04:29] me013 | I I I 'm sorry . What what is the problem that you 're trying to explain ?
[04:34] me013 | That the Oh .
[04:37] me013 | So much worse ?
[04:37] mn007 | uh so much worse . Yeah .
"[04:44] me013 | I mean , that it has to do with the um amount of training data . It it 's it 's orders of magnitude off ."
[04:50] mn007 | Yeah but Yeah .
"[04:54] mn007 | Yeah but we train only on digits and it 's it 's a digit task , so . Well ."
[04:57] me013 | But but
"[05:00] me013 | if you look at what commercial places do , they use a huge amount of data . This is a modest amount of data ."
[05:01] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[05:03] mn007 | Alright .
[05:05] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[05:12] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:14] me013 | But the thing is , if you have a huge in other words , do word models But if you have a huge amount of data"
[05:18] mn007 | Right .
[05:19] mn007 | Mmm .
[05:20] me013 | then you 're going to have many occurrences of similar uh allophones .
[05:24] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:29] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:30] me013 | I I think it has to be that , because , as you say , this is , you know , this is near - microphone , it 's really pretty clean data ."
[05:35] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:38] me013 | Now , some of it could be the fact that uh let 's see , in the in these multi - train things did we include noisy data in the"
[05:46] mn007 | Yeah .
"[05:46] me013 | training ? I mean , that could be hurting us actually , for the clean case ."
"[05:54] mn007 | are better than the multi - train , yeah ."
[05:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[06:00] me013 | But um .
[06:02] me013 | Uh .
[06:04] me013 | So .
"[06:06] mn007 | well , let 's say if we if we add enough data to train on the um"
[06:10] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[06:12] mn007 | on the Meeting Recorder digits ,"
[06:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:14] mn007 | I guess we could have better results than this .
[06:17] mn007 | And .
[06:18] mn007 | What I meant is that perhaps we can learn something
"[06:21] mn007 | uh from this ,"
[06:22] mn007 | what 's what 's wrong
[06:24] mn007 | uh
[06:30] me013 | What kind of numbers are we getting on TI - digits ?
"[06:32] mn007 | It 's point eight percent , so ."
[06:38] me013 | Oh . I see .
[06:38] mn007 | Four - Fourier .
[06:39] mn007 | @ @
[06:42] mn007 | Yeah . Yeah .
[06:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[06:46] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:48] me013 | Sure , but I mean ,"
[06:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[07:05] mn007 | Mmm .
[07:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[07:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[07:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[07:30] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[07:34] me013 | Um .
[07:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:05] me013 | Um .
[08:10] me013 | Yeah .
[08:30] me013 | the uh point eight percent for for for the original TI - digits database ?
[08:36] me013 | Um .
[08:40] mn007 | th that 's my point I I I don't
[08:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:58] me013 | Um . Why is it uh four times as high ,"
[09:03] me013 | or more ?
"[09:10] me013 | Right ? I mean , there 's even though it 's close - miked there 's still there really is background noise ."
[09:15] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[09:16] me013 | Um . And uh I suspect when the TI - digits were recorded if somebody fumbled or said something wrong or something that they probably made them take it over .
[09:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[09:28] me013 | It was not I mean there was no attempt to have it be realistic in any in any sense at all .
[09:28] mn007 | Well .
[09:31] mn007 | Yeah .
[09:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:42] mn007 | whereas these Meeting Recorder digits
[09:46] mn007 | sometimes you have breath noise and
[09:50] mn007 | Mmm .
"[09:53] mn007 | It 's not controlled at all , I mean ."
[09:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm . But -
"[10:12] me013 | um ,"
"[10:14] me013 | the SRI results . I mean , they 're much much better , but still you 're getting something like one point three percent"
[10:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:34] me013 | on the actual TI - digits . So this I think , on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder ."
[10:35] mn007 | Mmm .
[10:41] me013 | Um .
[10:41] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[10:45] me013 | uh I mean it 's still read .
"[10:59] me013 | I mean , I 'm sure they wouldn't release the numbers , but I don't think that uh"
[11:03] me013 | the uh the the companies that that do telephone speech get anything like point four percent on their
"[11:13] me013 | Uh , I mean , for one thing people do phone up who don't have uh"
[11:16] me013 | uh Middle America accents and
[11:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[11:28] me013 | Um .
[11:29] me013 | I mean .
[11:31] me013 | OK . That was that topic . What else we got ?
[11:35] mn007 | Um .
"[11:42] me013 | I know Thilo and Dan Ellis are are submitting something , but uh ."
[11:46] mn007 | Yeah . I I guess e the only thing with
"[12:06] me013 | Now , actually for the for the Aur - uh we do have stuff for Aurora , right ? Because because we have ano an extra month or something ."
[12:09] mn007 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[12:12] mn007 | Yeah . So . Yeah , for sure we will"
[12:14] me013 | Yeah .
[12:15] mn007 | do something for
[12:18] mn007 | the special session . Yeah .
[12:21] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[12:27] me013 | That 's fine .
[12:29] me013 | Um .
[12:31] me013 | Anything else ?
"[12:49] mn007 | So , yeah ."
[12:56] mn007 | the results are
[12:59] mn007 | similar to the
[13:00] mn007 | France Telecom results and
[13:02] me013 | Hmm .
[13:06] mn007 | Um .
[13:09] mn007 | So there is this point .
"[13:19] mn007 | um ,"
[13:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:23] mn007 | well , this VAD"
"[13:28] mn007 | and we if we put it on the server side ,"
[13:39] mn007 | so you accumulate the delay so
[13:48] mn007 | and
[13:49] me013 | So wha where did this good VAD come from ?
[13:50] mn007 | So .
[13:52] mn007 | It 's
[13:53] mn007 | um from OGI . So
"[13:58] mn007 | it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units , and"
[14:02] mn007 | um
[14:04] mn007 | nine input frames compared to
[14:07] mn007 | the VAD that was
[14:08] mn007 | in the proposal which has
[14:10] mn007 | a very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs .
[14:16] mn007 | Yeah .
"[14:18] me013 | Yeah , but they had to get rid of it because of the space , didn't they ?"
[14:21] mn007 | Yeah . So .
[14:23] mn007 | Yeah . But the abso assumption is that
[14:30] mn007 | And .
[14:33] mn007 | Yeah but nnn .
[14:41] me013 | if if I I don't know what the thinking was amongst the the the the ETSI folk but um
[14:48] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:53] mn007 | They just want , apparently they don't want to fix the VAD because"
[14:57] mn007 | they think there is some interaction between
[15:02] mn007 | and
[15:06] mn007 | But
[15:07] mn007 | they still want to just to give some
[15:12] mn007 | requirement for this VAD because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard .
[15:19] me013 | OK .
[15:19] mn007 | So .
[15:20] mn007 | So it must be at least
[15:27] mn007 | uh not yet
[15:30] mn007 | Nnn .
[15:34] me013 | s
[15:43] mn007 | Yeah .
"[15:44] me013 | You know , as long as it did the job ."
[15:47] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[15:50] me013 | So that 's good .
[15:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[15:56] mn007 | Uh I designed a new a new filter
[16:00] mn007 | because
[16:01] mn007 | when I designed other filters
[16:10] me013 | Right .
[16:11] mn007 | uh Hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty - s
[16:16] me013 | Yeah .
"[16:18] me013 | You didn't gain anything , right ?"
[16:19] mn007 | And . So I did that and
[16:21] mn007 | uh it 's running .
"[16:23] mn007 | So , let 's see"
[16:25] mn007 | what will happen .
[16:27] mn007 | Uh but the filter is of course closer
[16:32] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[16:33] mn007 | Mmm .
[16:36] mn007 | Um . Yeah .
"[16:40] me013 | So that means logically , in principle , it should be better . So probably it 'll be worse ."
[16:48] me013 | Or in the basic
[16:52] mn007 | Yeah . Sure .
[16:57] me013 | OK .
"[16:57] mn007 | Yeah , and then we 've started to work with this of um"
[17:00] mn007 | voiced - unvoiced
[17:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[17:03] mn007 | stuff .
[17:04] mn007 | And
[17:10] mn007 | perhaps try to have um
[17:12] mn007 | a new system with uh uh MSG stream also
[17:16] mn007 | see what what happens .
"[17:24] mn007 | So , something that 's similar to the proposal too , but with MSG stream ."
[17:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[17:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[17:29] mn007 | Mmm .
[17:31] me013 | OK .
[17:41] fn002 | I begin to play
[17:59] fn002 | between the um FFT of the signal and the small
[18:06] fn002 | we after the um mel filter bank .
[18:09] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[18:10] fn002 | And , well , is more or less robust ."
[18:12] fn002 | Is good for clean speech . Is
[18:16] me013 | Huh ?
[18:16] fn002 | for noisy speech .
[18:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:18] fn002 | but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT ,"
[18:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[18:23] fn002 | and is not ready yet
[18:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[18:25] fn002 | to use on , well , I don't know ."
[18:29] me013 | Yeah .
[18:35] me013 | Right .
[18:35] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[18:39] fn002 | I have here .
[18:40] fn002 | I have here
[18:40] mn007 | Mmm .
"[18:42] fn002 | for one signal , for one frame ."
[18:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[18:45] fn002 | The the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this ."
[18:45] me013 | Uh - huh .
[18:55] me013 | Uh .
"[18:57] fn002 | These are the two the mixed , the big signal is for clean ."
"[19:02] me013 | There 's None of these axes are labeled , so I don't know what this What 's this axis ?"
"[19:09] fn002 | nnn , "" frame "" ."
[19:11] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[19:12] me013 | And what 's th what this ?
"[19:14] fn002 | Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum ."
"[19:18] fn002 | Of the - No , this is the variance , the difference"
[19:22] fn002 | between
[19:23] fn002 | the spectrum of the signal
[19:26] fn002 | and
[19:28] fn002 | FFT of each frame of the signal and
[19:31] fn002 | this mouth spectrum of time after the f
[19:35] me013 | For this one .
[19:35] fn002 | may fit
[19:36] me013 | For the noi
"[19:36] fn002 | for the two ,"
"[19:37] fn002 | this big , to here , they are to signal ."
[19:40] fn002 | This is for clean and this is for noise .
[19:44] me013 | Oh . There 's two things on the same graph .
"[19:45] fn002 | Yeah . I don't know . I I think that I have d another graph , but I 'm not sure ."
[19:50] mn007 | Yeah .
[19:50] me013 | So w which is clean and which is noise ?
[19:53] mn007 | I think the lower one is noise .
[19:54] fn002 | The lower is noise and the height is clean .
[19:57] me013 | OK . So it 's harder to distinguish
[20:00] fn002 | It 's height .
[20:00] mn007 | Yeah .
[20:02] fn002 | Oh . I must to have .
"[20:04] fn002 | Pity , but I don't have"
[20:07] fn002 | two different
[20:12] mn007 | So this should the the the t
[20:14] mn007 | voiced
[20:15] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[20:15] fn002 | Yeah , it is the height"
[20:16] mn007 | portions .
[20:17] fn002 | is voiced portion .
[20:20] fn002 | And this is the noise portion .
[20:23] me013 | Uh - huh .
[20:23] fn002 | And this is more or less like this .
[20:25] fn002 | But I meant to have see @ @ two two the picture .
[20:25] me013 | Yeah .
[20:28] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:29] fn002 | This is , for example , for one frame ."
[20:31] me013 | Yeah
[20:32] fn002 | the the spectrum of the signal .
[20:35] fn002 | And this is the small
[20:37] fn002 | version of the spectrum after ML
[20:40] fn002 | mel filter bank .
[20:42] me013 | Yeah . And this is the difference ?
[20:42] fn002 | And this is
[20:44] fn002 | I don't know .
[20:48] fn002 | with LPC model
[20:50] fn002 | the spectrum but
[20:52] fn002 | using Matlab without going factor and s
[20:57] fn002 | Not pre - emphasis . Nothing .
[20:59] fn002 | And the I think that this is good .
[21:06] fn002 | this is another frame .
"[21:11] fn002 | envelope ,"
"[21:12] fn002 | this envelope ,"
[21:15] fn002 | with the mel filter bank .
[21:28] me013 | Um .
"[21:29] me013 | But if you were to really try and get a voiced - unvoiced , do you do you want to totally ignore that ? I mean , do you do you I mean ,"
"[21:34] me013 | clearly a a very big very big cues for voiced - unvoiced come from uh spectral slope and so on , right ?"
[21:41] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:43] me013 | Um .
[21:49] me013 | Yeah . I see .
[21:50] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:51] fn002 | Yeah because when did noise
[21:52] mn007 | Uh .
[21:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:58] fn002 | if s @ @
[21:59] fn002 | val value is
[22:00] fn002 | indicative that is a voice frame and it 's
[22:04] me013 | Yeah .
[22:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:07] me013 | certainly if you want to do good voiced - unvoiced detection , you need a few features . Each each feature is by itself not enough . But , you know , people look at at slope and uh"
[22:17] mn007 | Mmm .
[22:36] mn007 | Mmm .
[22:41] me013 | Uh . Or maybe you could you just do it going through the P FFT 's figuring out some um probable um harmonic structure .
[22:49] me013 | Right . And and uh .
[22:50] mn007 | Mmm .
[22:55] fn002 | the paper that you s give me yesterday .
[23:02] fn002 | they are some
[23:02] fn002 | problem
"[23:03] mn007 | Yeah , but it 's not it 's , yeah , it 's it 's another problem . Yeah"
[23:06] fn002 | Is another problem .
"[23:09] mn007 | Yeah , there is"
[23:10] mn007 | th this fact actually . If you
[23:15] me013 | Yeah .
[23:17] mn007 | What 's this again ? Is it the mel - filters ?
[23:20] fn002 | Yeah like this . Of kind like this .
[23:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[23:22] mn007 | OK .
[23:23] mn007 | So the envelope here is the output of the mel - filters
[23:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:26] mn007 | and what we clearly see is that in some cases ,"
[23:31] mn007 | and
"[23:32] mn007 | the the harmonics are resolved by the f Well ,"
"[23:36] mn007 | there are still appear after mel - filtering ,"
[23:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[23:42] mn007 | for high pitched voice because
[23:48] mn007 | is sometimes even smaller than the pitch .
[23:51] me013 | Yeah .
[23:53] me013 | Right .
[23:56] mn007 | Nnn .
[23:59] mn007 | And so what happens is that this
[24:07] me013 | Yeah .
[24:08] mn007 | um
[24:10] mn007 | so we were thinking to modify the mel - spectrum to have something that that 's smoother on low frequencies .
[24:20] mn007 | i
[24:22] mn007 | Yeah . This is a separate thing .
[24:23] fn002 | Yeah .
[24:23] me013 | Separate thing ? Yeah .
[24:24] mn007 | And .
[24:38] mn007 | Yeah .
[24:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:56] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:56] me013 | by uh
"[25:04] me013 | It 's uh a variant on what you 're s what you 're doing . The I mean , the the the mel"
[25:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:31] me013 | if was uh noisy , the proportion that it would go down would be"
[25:36] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:36] me013 | if it was if it was unvoiced or something .
[25:39] me013 | So you oughta be able to pick out voiced segments .
[25:43] me013 | At least it should be another another cue .
[25:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[26:06] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:27] me006 | you know ,"
[26:38] me006 | um
[26:47] me006 | the uh the great advantages that
[27:02] me006 | you can imagine um
[27:06] me006 | um features
[27:14] me006 | with uh undirected links
[27:18] me013 | Hmm .
[27:29] me006 | and um
"[27:31] me006 | yeah , I 've just been continue reading"
[27:34] me006 | um about certain things .
[27:34] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[27:41] me006 | um
[27:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[27:52] me006 | it seems like the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about
"[28:04] me006 | So , um . Yeah ."
[28:06] me006 | Just
[28:07] me006 | that 's about it .
[28:09] me013 | OK .
[28:13] me026 | OK . And um so I 've been looking at Avendano 's work and um
[28:51] me026 | the reverberation responses um simply convolved
[28:56] me026 | um
"[28:56] me026 | in , but"
[28:58] me026 | it 's not really with these ten millisecond frames
[29:00] me026 | cuz you j
[29:12] me026 | and the then it um
[29:37] me026 | that 's supposed to d
[29:55] me026 | method training trading the um the spectral resolution for time resolution and um
[30:11] me026 | frequency resolution .
[30:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[30:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:47] me026 | Oh , and um , another f first step is um , so the the way I want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response um and um"
[31:00] me026 | we don't really know how fast
[31:09] me026 | we we have this um block least squares um
[31:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:39] me013 | OK .
[31:46] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:46] me013 | Yeah .
[32:46] me026 | Is there a particular way we 're supposed to read them ?
[32:48] mn007 | There are only zeros here . Well .
"[32:51] me013 | No . "" O "" "" O "" "" O "" and "" zero "" are two ways that we say that digit ."
[32:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:58] me013 | so it 's i
"[32:58] mn007 | Perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the if we want to the the guy to say "" O "" or"
[33:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[33:07] mn007 | OK .
[33:07] me026 | Alright .
[33:14] me026 | OK .
[33:19] mn007 | because here you only have zeros
[33:24] me013 | they they write down OH . or they write down ZERO a and they and they each have their own pronunciation .
"[33:28] mn007 | Yeah but if the sh the sheet was prepared with a different sign for the "" O "" ."
[33:32] me013 | But people wouldn't know what that wa
[33:33] me013 | I mean there is no convention for it .
[33:34] mn007 | OK .
[33:36] mn007 | Yeah .
"[33:38] me013 | "" OK when we write this , say it tha "" , you know , and you just They just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would and and people"
[33:40] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[33:42] mn007 | Yeah .
[33:43] mn007 | Yep .
[33:45] me013 | say it different ways .
[33:46] me026 | OK . Is this a change from the last batch of of um forms ? Because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read .
"[33:51] mn007 | Yeah , it was orthographic , so ."
[33:58] me026 | Oh . OK .
[34:02] me026 | OK .
[34:05] me026 | OK .
[34:06] me013 | OK .
"[34:59] me013 | when I 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and and saying these numbers , I almost always say zero ."
"[35:19] me013 | Yeah it 's shorter . Yeah . So it 's So . So uh . Now , don't think about it ."
[37:54] me013 | OK . We 're done .

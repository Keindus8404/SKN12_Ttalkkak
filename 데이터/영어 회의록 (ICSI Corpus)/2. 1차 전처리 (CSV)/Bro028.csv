"[00:01] me018 | Eh , we should be going ."
"[00:04] me013 | So ne next week we 'll have , uh , both Birger and , uh ,"
[00:10] me013 | Michael Kleinschmidt and Birger Kollmeier will join us .
"[00:18] me013 | you 're probably gonna go up in a couple three weeks or so ? When d when are you thinking of going up to , uh ,"
[00:23] me013 | OGI ?
"[00:23] mn007 | Yeah , like ,"
[00:28] me013 | OK .
[00:32] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[00:39] mn007 | maybe we can start with this .
"[00:46] me013 | All today , huh ?"
[00:47] mn007 | Yeah .
[00:48] me013 | Oh .
"[00:52] mn007 | Yeah . So there was this conference call this morning ,"
"[00:55] mn007 | um ,"
[00:56] mn007 | and the only topic on the agenda was just to discuss
[01:00] mn007 | a and to
"[01:05] me013 | No , this I 'm sorry , this is a conference call between different Aurora people or just ?"
"[01:08] mn007 | Uh , yeah . It 's the conference call between the Aurora , uh , group ."
[01:10] me013 | It 's the main conference call .
[01:11] me013 | OK .
"[01:14] mn007 | Uh , yeah . There were like two hours of discussions ,"
"[01:18] mn007 | and then suddenly ,"
"[01:20] mn007 | uh , people were tired , I guess , and they decided on"
"[01:31] mn007 | Uh , it means that it 's like eighty milliseconds less than before ."
[01:38] mn007 | Um .
[01:38] me013 | And what are we sitting at currently ?
"[01:40] mn007 | So , currently d uh , we have system that has two hundred and thirty . So ,"
[01:40] me013 | Yeah .
[01:45] mn007 | that 's fine .
[01:46] me013 | Two thirty .
"[01:52] mn007 | Yeah . But that 's Yeah . That 's not a problem , I I guess ."
[01:58] me013 | OK .
[01:58] mn007 | Um .
[01:58] me013 | W
"[01:59] me013 | It 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the VAD at this point , right ?"
"[02:03] mn007 | Yeah . At this point , yeah ."
"[02:05] mn007 | Yeah , uh - huh ."
[02:06] me013 | Yeah . We probably should do that pretty soon so that we don't get used to it being a certain way .
[02:10] me013 | Yeah .
[02:11] mn007 | Um .
[02:13] me013 | on the phone ?
"[02:14] mn007 | Yeah , sure ."
[02:15] me013 | OK .
"[02:15] mn007 | Well , it was mainly a discussion between Hari and"
[02:17] me013 | Hmm .
[02:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[02:21] mn007 | Uh ,"
[02:22] me013 | OK .
"[02:28] mn007 | Uh , yeah . So ,"
[02:29] mn007 | the second thing is the system that we have currently .
"[02:32] mn007 | Oh , yes . We have , like , a system that gives sixty - two percent"
"[02:36] mn007 | improvement , but"
"[02:41] mn007 | Well , it has a latency of two thirty , but"
[02:44] mn007 | if you want also to stick to the number
"[02:46] mn007 | of features that limit it to sixty ,"
[02:50] mn007 | then we go a little bit down but it 's still sixty - one percent .
"[02:54] mn007 | Uh , and if we drop the tandem network , then we have fifty - seven percent ."
"[03:00] me013 | Uh , but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network ?"
[03:05] me013 | OK .
"[03:06] me013 | And i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size in terms of ?"
[03:13] me013 | No .
[03:15] mn007 | No .
[03:17] me013 | OK .
[03:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:23] mn007 | the maps the the MIPs ,"
[03:24] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:25] mn007 | I think it fits , but it 's , uh , m mainly a problem of memory ."
[03:29] me013 | Right .
"[03:31] mn007 | and I don't know how much this can be discussed or not ,"
[03:39] me013 | Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ?
"[03:45] me013 | Yeah . I 'd like to see that , cuz maybe I could"
"[03:47] me013 | think a little bit about it , cuz we"
"[03:50] me013 | maybe we could make it a little smaller or I mean , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all ."
[03:52] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[03:54] me013 | Uh , I 'd like to see how far off"
[03:56] me013 | we are .
[04:00] me013 | have it
"[04:01] me013 | on the , uh ,"
"[04:02] me013 | t uh , server side . Right ?"
[04:03] mn007 | Yeah .
[04:04] me013 | OK .
"[04:09] me013 | Uh , well , y you 're saying here ."
"[04:15] mn007 | Yeah , there were small tricks to make this tandem network work ."
"[04:19] mn007 | Uh ,"
"[04:21] mn007 | mmm ,"
"[04:26] mn007 | um , use"
[04:29] mn007 | some kind of hierarchical structure where the silence probability is not computed by the final tandem network but by the VAD network .
"[04:38] mn007 | Um ,"
[04:46] mn007 | and we re - scale the other probabilities by one minus
[04:47] me013 | Huh .
[04:51] mn007 | the silence probability .
"[04:55] mn007 | So it 's some kind of hierarchical thing ,"
"[05:13] mn007 | Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that ,"
[05:23] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:24] mn007 | So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities
[05:25] me013 | Yeah .
[05:28] me013 | Yeah .
[05:29] mn007 | and the silence probabilities also .
[05:30] me013 | Right .
[05:31] mn007 | And
"[05:33] mn007 | things get better when , instead of using the silence probability computed by the"
"[05:37] mn007 | tandem network , we use the silence probability ,"
"[05:40] mn007 | uh , given by the VAD network ,"
[05:50] mn007 | but
"[05:51] mn007 | maybe ,"
"[05:53] mn007 | So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units ,"
[05:57] mn007 | and the tandem network has five hundred .
[06:00] mn007 | Um .
"[06:01] mn007 | So it 's smaller but th the silence probability from this network seems , uh , better ."
[06:07] me013 | OK .
[06:17] me013 | Yeah . But OK .
[06:25] mn007 | Well !
[06:36] me006 | wh what led you to do that .
"[06:39] mn007 | problem that we observed ,"
"[06:42] mn007 | um ,"
"[06:45] mn007 | that there was there were , like ,"
[06:47] mn007 | many insertions in the in the system .
[06:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:51] mn007 | Mmm .
[06:51] me013 | Hmm .
"[06:51] mn007 | Actually plugging in the tandem network was increasing ,"
"[06:55] mn007 | I I I think , the number of insertions ."
[07:03] mn007 | So it looked strange and then just using the the other silence probability helps . Mmm .
[07:19] me013 | combining knowledge sources . Right ? Because
[07:22] me013 | the fact that you have these two nets
"[07:24] me013 | that are different sizes means they behave a little differently , they find different things ."
"[07:29] me013 | And , um ,"
"[07:31] me013 | if you have ,"
"[07:34] me013 | f the distribution that you have from ,"
"[07:37] me013 | uh , f speech sounds"
"[07:42] me013 | and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other ,"
"[07:45] me013 | which is essentially what 's happening , you have this other"
[07:48] me013 | source of knowledge that you 're putting in there . So you make use of both of them
[07:51] me013 | in in what you 're ending up with .
[07:53] me013 | Maybe it 's better .
[07:53] mn007 | Yeah .
"[07:55] me013 | Anyway ,"
[07:56] mn007 | Yeah .
"[07:57] mn007 | And and the features are different also . I mean ,"
[07:59] mn007 | the VAD doesn't use the same features there are .
[07:59] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:02] me013 | Oh !
"[08:04] me013 | That might be the key ,"
[08:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:05] me013 | actually .
[08:06] me013 | Cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech
[08:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:09] me013 | for that .
[08:12] me013 | That 's a good point .
"[08:18] mn007 | Uh . Well , there are other things that we should do but ,"
"[08:23] mn007 | um ,"
"[08:28] mn007 | so , these things are like hav having a better VAD ."
[08:34] mn007 | probably implies working a little bit on
[08:37] mn007 | features that are more
[08:38] mn007 | suited to
[08:39] mn007 | a voice activity detection .
"[08:53] me013 | I mean , back on the second stream , I mean , that 's something we 've talked about for a while . I mean ,"
[08:57] me013 | I think
[09:00] mn007 | Yeah . Mmm .
"[09:01] me013 | Um ,"
[09:02] me013 | so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral
[09:07] me013 | thing ?
"[09:08] mn007 | Uh , yeah . But ,"
[09:08] me013 | for a second stream ?
"[09:09] mn007 | um ,"
"[09:11] mn007 | we we did a first try with this , and it it"
[09:14] mn007 | clearly hurts .
"[09:15] me013 | But , uh , how was the stream combined ?"
[09:16] mn007 | Uh .
"[09:19] mn007 | It was c it was just combined , um ,"
"[09:22] mn007 | by the acoustic model . So there was ,"
[09:25] mn007 | no neural network for the moment . Mm - hmm .
"[09:26] me013 | Right . So , I mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there ,"
"[09:32] me013 | that , uh ,"
[09:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[09:34] me013 | might be good .
[09:35] mn007 | Mmm .
"[09:41] mn007 | Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation and th um ,"
"[09:49] mn007 | tandem network , right now , is like i is using the noises from the Aurora task and"
"[09:58] mn007 | um ,"
[09:59] mn007 | try to argue about that because
[10:06] me013 | Right .
[10:09] mn007 | So we have t n
"[10:15] me013 | Yeah . Maybe you just put in some other noise , something that 's different ."
[10:15] mn007 | this problem .
[10:16] mn007 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[10:17] me013 | I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there ."
[10:21] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[10:21] me013 | But it may be something else th at least you could say it was .
[10:22] mn007 | Yeah .
"[10:24] me013 | And then if it doesn't hurt too much , though ."
[10:25] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[10:26] me013 | Yeah . That 's a good idea .
[10:30] mn007 | Yeah . The last thing is that
[10:32] mn007 | I think we are getting close to human performance .
"[10:36] mn007 | Well , that 's something I would like to investigate further , but ,"
"[10:44] mn007 | I did , uh , listen to the m most noisy utterances of the SpeechDat - Car Italian and"
[10:50] mn007 | tried to transcribe them .
[10:53] me013 | So this is a particular human . This is this i this is Stephane . Yeah .
"[11:05] mn007 | what happens is is that ,"
"[11:07] mn007 | uh , the digit error rate"
"[11:10] mn007 | on this is around one percent ,"
[11:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:16] mn007 | Um , but what happens also is that if"
[11:22] mn007 | a re - synthesized version of
[11:24] mn007 | the speech
"[11:25] mn007 | and I re - synthesized this using a white noise that 's filtered by a LPC ,"
[11:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:33] mn007 | Um ,"
"[11:34] mn007 | well , you can argue , that , uh that this is not speech , so the ear is not"
[11:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:44] me013 | There 's two problems there . I mean I mean , so so the first is"
[11:45] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[11:52] me013 | i i you 're you 're adding other degradation .
[11:54] me013 | Right ? So it 's not just the noise but you 're adding in fact some degradation because it 's only an approximation .
"[12:00] me013 | Um ,"
[12:01] me013 | and the second thing is which is
"[12:06] me013 | if you do it with whispered speech ,"
[12:10] me013 | you get this number .
[12:11] me013 | What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ?
[12:17] me013 | Alright ? So now you put the pitch in .
[12:20] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[12:21] me013 | What would the percentage be then ?
"[12:23] me013 | See , that 's the question ."
"[12:27] me013 | if it 's , uh Let 's say it 's back down to one percent again ."
[12:30] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[12:30] me013 | That would say at least for people ,"
"[12:32] me013 | having the pitch is really , really important ,"
[12:34] me013 | which would be interesting in itself .
"[12:37] me013 | if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent ,"
[12:44] me013 | You know ?
[12:44] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[12:47] me013 | I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to
[12:50] mn007 | Ye -
[12:52] me013 | the human performance .
[12:56] mn007 | what I what I listened to when I re - synthesized the LP - the LPC - twelve spectrum
"[13:02] mn007 | is in a way what the system , uh , is hearing ,"
"[13:11] mn007 | well , the excitation is is"
[13:13] mn007 | not taken into account .
[13:15] mn007 | That 's what we do with our system .
[13:17] mn007 | And
[13:22] me013 | What if you did LPC - twenty ?
[13:25] me013 | Twenty .
[13:27] me013 | Right ?
"[13:28] me013 | I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great"
[13:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[13:32] me013 | representation of speech .
[13:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:34] me013 | So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the ,"
"[13:37] me013 | uh , removal of pitch ,"
[13:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:40] me013 | you also are doing ,"
"[13:41] me013 | uh , a particular parameterization ,"
"[13:44] me013 | which , um ,"
[13:47] mn007 | Mmm .
"[13:53] me013 | No . Actually , we d we we don't , because we do we do , uh ,"
"[13:57] me013 | uh , mel filter bank , for instance . Right ?"
"[14:01] mn007 | is it that different , I mean ?"
"[14:02] me013 | Um ,"
"[14:04] me013 | I don't know what mel , uh , based synthesis would sound like , but certainly the spectra are quite different ."
[14:04] mn007 | I
[14:10] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[14:10] me018 | Couldn't you t
"[14:11] me018 | couldn't you , um ,"
[14:14] me018 | test the human performance on just the original audio ?
[14:18] mn007 | This is the one percent number .
"[14:20] me013 | Yeah , it 's one percent . He 's trying to remove the pitch information"
[14:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:22] me018 | Oh , oh . OK , I see ."
[14:23] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[14:23] me013 | and make it closer to what to what we 're seeing as the feature vectors .
"[14:27] me018 | OK . So , y"
"[14:28] me018 | uh , your performance was one percent ,"
[14:30] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[14:30] me018 | and then when you re - synthesize with LPC - twelve it went to five .
[14:33] me018 | OK .
[14:37] me013 | We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges because we
[14:42] me013 | are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition .
[14:45] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[14:46] me013 | And , um ,"
[14:48] me013 | i
[14:48] me013 | if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer
[14:52] me013 | to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good .
[14:54] mn007 | Yeah .
"[14:58] me013 | might actually make it even harder ,"
"[15:00] me013 | uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve . So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve"
[15:05] me013 | puts in synthesis puts in some degradation
[15:08] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[15:08] me013 | that 's not what we 're used to hearing ,"
"[15:10] me013 | and is ,"
"[15:13] me013 | it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum"
"[15:18] me013 | advantage of any information that 's presented to you . In fact , you"
[15:19] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[15:21] me013 | hear some things better than others .
"[15:23] me013 | And so it it isn't But ,"
"[15:24] me013 | I agree that it says that ,"
"[15:26] me013 | uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably ,"
"[15:30] me013 | um , um , a little bit , um ,"
[15:34] me013 | minimal . There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away .
[15:40] me013 | an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in .
"[15:44] me013 | So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in ,"
[15:48] me013 | and see does that is that does that make the difference ?
[15:51] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[15:51] me013 | If that if that takes it down to one percent again ,"
"[15:54] me013 | then you 'd say "" OK , it 's it 's in fact having ,"
"[15:56] me013 | um ,"
[16:00] me013 | also the the pitch
[16:07] me018 | But from this it 's pretty safe to say that
[16:09] me018 | the system is with either
[16:11] me018 | two to seven percent
[16:13] me018 | away from the performance of a human . Right ?
[16:16] me018 | So it 's somewhere in that range .
[16:17] me018 | Two two to six percent .
[16:25] me013 | for Stephane .
"[16:34] me013 | that 's what that 's the first thing that I would be curious about , is , you know , i i"
[16:39] me013 | when you we
[16:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:51] mn007 | uh , noise . I mean not periodic ."
[16:59] me018 | In the LPC synthesis ?
"[17:03] me013 | Yeah . You did LPC re - synthesis L PC re - synthesis . So ,"
[17:03] mn007 | I
[17:04] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[17:07] me013 | uh and you did it with a noise source ,"
[17:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:09] me013 | rather than with with a s periodic source .
"[17:13] me013 | Right ? So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise , where it 's voiced you use ,"
"[17:21] me013 | uh , periodic pulses ."
[17:23] mn007 | Um .
[17:24] me013 | Right ?
"[17:24] mn007 | Yeah , but it 's neither purely voiced or purely unvoiced ."
[17:29] mn007 | Esp - especially because there is noise .
"[17:35] me013 | um ,"
[17:39] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[17:41] mn007 | Yeah .
[17:41] me013 | voice thing .
"[17:42] me013 | Yeah . I mean , it 's probably not worth your time . It 's it 's a side thing and and and there 's a lot to do . But I 'm I 'm just saying , at least as a thought experiment ,"
"[17:45] mn007 | Uh - huh , yeah ."
[17:48] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:49] me013 | that 's what I would wanna test .
"[17:51] me013 | Uh , I wan would wanna drive it with a a a two - source system rather than a than a one - source system ."
[17:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:57] me013 | And then that would tell you whether in fact it 's Cuz we 've talked about , like , this harmonic tunneling or"
"[18:01] me013 | other things that people have done based on pitch ,"
[18:04] me013 | maybe that 's really a key element .
"[18:05] me013 | Maybe maybe , uh ,"
"[18:08] me013 | uh , without that ,"
[18:08] me013 | it 's it 's not possible to do a whole lot better than we 're doing . That that could be .
[18:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:15] me013 | Yeah .
[18:17] mn007 | Mmm . Evi -
"[18:18] me013 | But , I mean , other than that , I don't think it 's I mean , other than the pitch de information ,"
[18:22] me013 | it 's hard to imagine that there 's a whole lot more
[18:27] me013 | that we 're throwing away that 's important .
"[18:32] me013 | Right ? I mean , we 're using"
[18:36] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[18:42] me013 | Hmm .
[18:44] me013 | Yeah .
[18:46] me013 | Yeah . That look
[18:47] me013 | Yeah .
[18:50] me013 | I would figure .
[18:51] me013 | If somebody was
"[18:52] me013 | paying really close attention ,"
"[18:54] me013 | you might get I would actually think that if ,"
"[18:58] me013 | you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent"
"[19:03] me013 | error on digits . Uh ,"
[19:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[19:08] mn007 | @ @
[19:09] me013 | we 're not
"[19:10] me013 | incredibly far off . On the other hand ,"
"[19:12] me013 | with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually"
[19:17] me013 | usable
[19:18] me013 | in a commercial system with
[19:20] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[19:20] me013 | a full telephone number or something .
[19:24] me013 | Yeah .
[19:26] me013 | Right .
[19:34] me013 | Good .
"[19:36] me013 | Um , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can"
[19:39] me013 | talk a little about the
"[19:40] me013 | status with the , uh ,"
[19:43] me013 | Wall Street Journal things for it .
"[19:45] me018 | So I 've , um , downloaded ,"
"[19:48] me018 | uh ,"
[19:49] me018 | a couple of things from Mississippi State .
"[19:51] me018 | Um , one is their"
"[19:53] me018 | software their ,"
"[19:54] me018 | uh , LVCSR system ."
[19:56] me018 | Downloaded the latest version of that .
[19:58] me018 | Got it compiled and everything .
"[20:00] me018 | Um , downloaded"
[20:02] me018 | the scripts . They wrote some scripts that sort of make it easy to run
"[20:06] me018 | the system on the Wall Street Journal ,"
"[20:08] me018 | uh ,"
[20:08] me018 | data .
"[20:09] me018 | Um ,"
[20:10] me018 | so I haven't run the scripts yet .
"[20:12] me018 | Uh , I 'm waiting there was one problem with part of it and I wrote a note to Joe asking him about it ."
[20:17] me018 | So I 'm waiting to hear from him .
"[20:19] me018 | But , um , I did print something out just to give you an idea about"
[20:23] me018 | where the system is .
"[20:24] me018 | Uh ,"
"[20:26] me018 | on their web site they , uh , did this little table of where their system performs relative to"
[20:31] me018 | other systems that have done this this task .
"[20:34] me018 | And , um , the Mississippi State system"
"[20:37] me018 | using a bigram grammar ,"
"[20:39] me018 | uh , is at about eight point two percent ."
"[20:41] me018 | Other comparable systems from ,"
"[20:45] me018 | were getting from , uh , like six point nine , six point eight percent ."
[20:49] me013 | This is on clean
[20:50] me013 | test set ?
[20:51] me018 | on clean stuff . Yeah . They they 've started a table
[20:59] me018 | and I didn't
"[21:00] me018 | notice until after I 'd printed it out that ,"
"[21:02] me018 | um ,"
[21:08] me018 | So I I don't know what those numbers really mean .
[21:10] me013 | What kind of numbers are they getting on these on the test conditions ?
"[21:16] me018 | the they 're showing word error rate . But on this one ,"
"[21:19] me018 | I I don't know if these are word error rates because they 're really big . So ,"
[21:23] me018 | under
[21:25] me018 | condition one here it 's ten percent .
[21:27] me018 | Then under three it goes to sixty - four point six percent .
[21:31] me018 | Yeah .
[21:35] me018 | they 're really high .
"[21:41] me013 | uh , some of the higher error rates on , uh ,"
"[21:44] me013 | some of these w uh , uh ,"
"[21:49] mn007 | Uh . Yeah , it 's around fifteen to twenty percent ."
[21:54] me018 | Correct ?
[21:55] me018 | Accuracy ?
[21:57] me013 | Yeah .
"[21:57] mn007 | Twenty percent error rate ,"
[21:58] me013 | Yeah . So twenty percent error rate on digits .
"[22:02] me013 | So if you 're doing so if you 're doing ,"
"[22:02] me018 | Oh , oh , on digits . Yeah ."
[22:03] mn007 | On digits . And this is so so still the baseline . Right ?
[22:04] me018 | OK .
"[22:04] me013 | you know ,"
"[22:06] me013 | sixty - thousand Yeah , and if you 're saying sixty - thousand word recognition , getting sixty percent error on some of these noise condition not at all surprising ."
[22:06] me018 | Yeah .
[22:11] me018 | Yeah .
"[22:13] mn007 | The baseline is sixty percent also on digits ,"
"[22:16] me018 | Oh , is it ?"
[22:16] mn007 | on the m more mismatched conditions .
[22:19] me018 | OK .
[22:20] mn007 | So .
[22:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:21] me018 | So , yeah , that 's probably what it is then ."
[22:25] me018 | Yeah . So they have a lot of different conditions that they 're gonna be filling out .
[22:33] me018 | Yeah . It 's it 's gonna be hard .
"[22:35] me018 | they 're I I 'm still waiting for them to release the , um ,"
"[22:39] me018 | multi - CPU version of their scripts , cuz right now their script only handles"
"[22:42] me018 | processing on a single CPU ,"
[22:44] me018 | which will take a really long time
[22:47] me018 | to run . So .
[22:47] me013 | This is for the training ?
[22:48] me018 | But their s
"[22:53] me018 | I beli Yes , for the training also ."
[22:55] me013 | OK .
"[22:55] me018 | And , um , they 're supposed to be coming out with it any time , the multi - CPU one ."
[22:58] me013 | OK .
"[22:58] me018 | So , as soon as they get that , then I 'll I 'll grab those too and so w"
"[23:01] me013 | Yeah . Cuz we have to get started , cuz it 's cuz , uh ,"
[23:02] me018 | Yeah .
"[23:03] me018 | Yeah . I 'll go ahead and try to run it though with just the single CPU one , and I they they ,"
"[23:07] me018 | um , released like a smaller data set that you can use that only takes like sixteen hours to train and stuff ."
[23:13] me013 | Oh ! Good .
[23:16] me013 | Yeah .
[23:16] me018 | the thing works and everything .
[23:19] me013 | I guess the actual evaluation will be in six weeks or something .
[23:24] me013 | Is that about right you think ?
"[23:25] mn007 | Uh , we don't know yet , I I think ."
"[23:27] me013 | Really , we don't know ?"
[23:28] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[23:31] me013 | Hmm .
[23:31] me018 | It wasn't on the conference call this morning ?
[23:34] mn007 | No .
[23:37] me018 | Did they say anything
"[23:39] me018 | on the conference call about , um ,"
[23:42] me018 | how the Wall Street Journal part of the test was going to be run ?
[23:48] mn007 | No . Mmm .
[23:48] me018 | I thought I remembered hearing that some sites
[23:50] me018 | were saying that they didn't have the compute to be able to run the Wall Street Journal stuff
"[23:55] me018 | at their place ,"
[23:56] me018 | so there was some talk about having Mississippi State run the systems for them .
[24:01] me018 | Did did that come up at all ?
"[24:08] me018 | Oh , OK ."
"[24:08] mn007 | the meeting today and ,"
[24:12] mn007 | didn't read also the most recent mails about
"[24:17] mn007 | the large - vocabulary task . But ,"
"[24:19] mn007 | uh , did you do you still ,"
"[24:21] mn007 | uh , get the mails ?"
[24:23] mn007 | You 're not on the mailing list or what ?
[24:29] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[24:32] mn007 | Oh , yeah . So we should have a look at this ."
[24:44] me018 | Yeah .
[24:44] me013 | It just just sounds funny .
[24:51] me013 | anyway .
[24:52] me018 | Yeah . I 'm I 'm wondering about that because
"[24:55] me018 | there 's this whole issue about ,"
"[24:57] me018 | you know ,"
"[24:58] me018 | simple tuning parameters , like word insertion penalties ."
[25:01] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:01] me018 | And whether or not those are
[25:05] me018 | So .
[25:07] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:09] me018 | I mean , it makes a big difference . If you change your front - end ,"
"[25:12] me018 | you know ,"
"[25:12] me018 | the scale is completely can be completely different , so ."
[25:17] me018 | It seems reasonable that that at least should be
[25:20] me018 | tweaked to match the front - end .
[25:22] mn007 | You didn't get any answer from Joe ?
"[25:25] me018 | I did , but Joe said ,"
"[25:27] me018 | you know , "" what you 're saying makes sense and I don't know "" ."
[25:30] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[25:30] me018 | So he doesn't know what
"[25:31] me018 | the answer is . I mean , that 's th We had this"
"[25:33] me018 | back and forth a little bit about ,"
"[25:35] me018 | you know , are sites gonna are you gonna run this data for different sites ?"
"[25:40] me018 | if Mississippi State runs it , then maybe they 'll"
[25:43] me018 | do a little optimization
"[25:45] me018 | on that parameter ,"
[25:53] me018 | it 's just not clear yet what 's gonna happen .
"[25:56] me018 | Uh , he 's been putting this stuff out on their web site and for people to grab but"
[26:01] me018 | I haven't heard too much about
"[26:03] me013 | So it could be I mean , Chuck and I had actually talked about this a couple times , and and over some lunches , I think ,"
"[26:09] me013 | that , um ,"
"[26:12] me013 | The - there 's this question about , you know , what do you wanna scale ?"
[26:15] me013 | Suppose y you can't adjust
"[26:17] me013 | these word insertion penalties and so forth , so you have to do everything at the level of the features . What could you do ?"
"[26:22] me013 | And , uh , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling , some sort of root or or something of"
"[26:29] me013 | the , um ,"
"[26:31] me013 | uh , features ."
"[26:32] me013 | But the problem with that is that isn't quite the same , it occurred to me later ,"
"[26:36] me013 | because what you really want to do is scale the ,"
"[26:39] mn007 | Nnn , the dist"
[26:41] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:42] me013 | But ,"
"[26:43] me013 | what might get at something similar , it just occurred to me , is kind of an intermediate thing is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system ,"
[26:51] me013 | at least in that system what you could do
"[26:53] me013 | is take the , um ,"
"[26:56] me013 | uh ,"
"[26:57] me013 | values that come out of the net , which are something like log probabilities ,"
[27:02] me013 | and scale those .
"[27:04] me013 | And then , uh , um then at least"
[27:07] me013 | those things would have
"[27:12] me013 | And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations . So it 's it 's ,"
"[27:17] me013 | um ,"
[27:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[27:22] me013 | another way to do it .
"[27:25] mn007 | But , these values are not"
"[27:31] me013 | I know they 're not . But but ,"
[27:33] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[27:37] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:38] me013 | at the other end . So ,"
"[27:39] me013 | um , my thought was maybe I mean , they 're not used as probabilities ,"
[27:44] me013 | but
[27:46] me013 | we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than
"[27:52] me013 | probabilities , and so we can model them better . So , in a way we 're"
"[27:57] me013 | taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities , because"
[28:00] me013 | they 're this quantity that
[28:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[28:06] me013 | maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that . I d I don't know .
[28:13] me013 | a ruling back on this . And we may end up being in a situation where we just you know really can't change the
[28:18] me013 | word insertion penalty . But the other thing we could do
"[28:21] me013 | is also we could I mean , this this may not help us ,"
"[28:25] me013 | uh , in the evaluation but it might help us in our understanding at least . We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties ,"
"[28:36] me013 | playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . But in fact if we did that , it made a a big difference . """
"[28:42] me018 | it might be possible to ,"
"[28:46] me018 | uh , simulate"
[28:48] me018 | the back - end
[28:49] me018 | with some other
"[28:51] me018 | system . So we we get our f front - end features ,"
"[28:54] me018 | and then , uh ,"
[28:57] me018 | as part of the process of figuring out the scaling
[29:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[29:04] me018 | we have some back - end
[29:06] me018 | that we attach onto our features that
[29:09] me018 | sort of
[29:10] me018 | simulates what would be happening .
"[29:12] me018 | Um ,"
[29:13] me013 | And just adjust it until it 's the best number ?
"[29:16] me018 | our l version of the back - end ,"
"[29:18] me018 | uh ,"
"[29:20] me013 | Well , we can probably use the real thing , can't we ? And then jus just , uh ,"
"[29:23] me018 | Yeah . Oh , yeah ."
[29:23] me013 | use it on a reduced test set or something .
[29:25] me018 | That 's true .
[29:25] me013 | Yeah .
[29:26] me018 | And then we just use that to determine some scaling factor that we use .
[29:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[29:50] me018 | Yeah .
"[29:54] me006 | Out of curiosity , what what kind of recognizer is the one from Mississippi State ?"
"[29:59] me018 | Uh , w what do you mean when you say "" what kind "" ?"
"[30:01] me006 | Um , is it like a Gaussian mixture model ?"
[30:03] me018 | Yeah .
[30:04] me006 | OK .
"[30:05] me018 | It 's the same system that they use when they participate in the Hub - five evals . It 's a ,"
"[30:25] me013 | Do they have the same sort of mix - down sort of procedure , where they"
[30:29] me013 | start off with a small number of some things and ? Yeah .
[30:29] me018 | I don't know .
[30:31] me018 | Yeah . And then divide the mixtures in half . I don't know if they do that . I 'm not really sure .
[30:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:43] me018 | Yeah , th I have I I I don't have it up here but I have a the whole system description ,"
[30:43] me013 | or if it 's ?
[30:48] me018 | that describes
[30:49] me018 | exactly what their system is and I I 'm not sure .
[30:55] me013 | OK .
"[30:57] me018 | It 's some kind of a mixture of Gaussians and ,"
"[30:59] me018 | uh , clustering and ,"
[31:02] me018 | They 're they 're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features
[31:06] me018 | that people use nowadays .
"[31:12] me013 | come in in time to be relevant , but , uh , we had talked about , uh , Guenter"
"[31:17] me013 | playing around ,"
"[31:18] me013 | uh ,"
"[31:21] me013 | uh , possibly coming up with something"
"[31:29] me013 | uh , it wasn't going to work for him to do CVS ."
[31:31] mn007 | Yeah .
[31:32] mn007 | Yeah . So now he has a version of the software .
[31:34] me013 | So he just has it all sitting there . Yeah .
[31:36] mn007 | Yeah . Um Mm - hmm .
[31:40] me013 | he might work on improving the noise estimate or on
[31:47] me013 | Yeah . I just saw the Eurospeech We we didn't talk about it at our meeting but I just saw the just read the paper .
"[31:53] me013 | Someone , I forget the name , and and Ney , uh , about histogram"
[31:57] me013 | equalization ?
"[32:03] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper . I didn't see the poster ."
[32:03] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:07] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:20] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:21] mn007 | Right .
"[32:22] me013 | and they adjust the distribution . So you you have the distributions from the training set ,"
[32:24] mn007 | N
[32:28] me013 | So this is just a a histogram of of
"[32:38] me013 | of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever . And and and then ,"
[32:42] me018 | Hmm .
"[32:43] me013 | when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way ,"
"[32:48] me013 | you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data . You do this kind of piece - wise linear or ,"
"[33:05] me013 | they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way , because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to"
"[33:20] me013 | Uh and , uh , this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels . And then they have s they have some kind of ,"
[33:37] me018 | So is this a histogram across different frequency bins ?
"[33:42] me013 | Um , I think this i"
"[33:44] me013 | You know , I don't remember that ."
[33:46] me013 | Do you remember ?
"[33:54] me018 | So , one histogram per frequency bin ."
"[33:56] mn007 | Yeah , I guess ."
[34:01] me018 | So th
[34:02] me018 | Oh .
[34:07] me018 | Huh .
[34:07] me013 | I don't remember that .
"[34:08] me018 | that , um , histogram represents the different energy levels that have been seen at that frequency ?"
[34:15] me013 | And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah .
[34:17] me018 | Uh - huh .
[34:21] me013 | So you don't have to change the training . You just do a measurement over the training .
"[34:25] me013 | And then , uh , for testing , uh , you can do it for one per utterance ."
[34:29] me013 | Even relatively short utterances . And they claim it it works pretty well .
[34:35] me018 | Is the idea that you you run a test utterance
[34:43] me013 | I guess in pri
[34:43] me018 | what to do to the utterance to
[34:45] me013 | Yeah .
[34:47] me018 | I see .
[34:48] me018 | Hmm .
[34:49] me018 | Yeah .
[34:55] me018 | Hmm .
"[34:56] me013 | That that was sort of the idea . So that that seemed , you know , different ."
"[35:06] me013 | Cuz we you know , one thing that w that ,"
[35:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:07] me013 | uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find ,"
"[35:24] me013 | But there 's other things that we 're not doing . So , we 're not making any use of pitch ,"
"[35:32] me013 | uh , because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz . And and the ,"
"[35:37] me013 | uh , transcribers will have fun with that ."
"[35:43] me013 | the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much ."
[35:48] me013 | And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of
[35:51] me013 | matching the the hi distributions somehow .
"[35:54] me013 | Uh , not just , um ,"
[35:58] me013 | not just subtracting off your estimate of the noise .
[36:01] me013 | So .
[36:05] me013 | Guenter 's gonna
"[36:10] mn007 | Uh ,"
"[36:11] mn007 | I dunno . I don't have feedback from him , but"
[36:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:15] me013 | Well , he 's got it anyway , so he can ."
[36:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[36:17] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[36:17] me013 | So potentially if he came up with something that was useful , like a diff a better noise estimation module or something , he could ship it to you guys u up there and"
[36:24] mn007 | Yeah .
[36:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[36:29] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:45] me013 | other territory . But , uh ,"
"[36:54] me013 | uh , maybe just , uh , quickly today about maybe"
[37:00] me013 | and then Barry can say something about what what we 're talking about .
[37:00] me026 | OK .
"[37:04] me026 | So Michael Kleinschmidt , who 's a PHD student from Germany ,"
[37:07] me026 | showed up this week . He 'll be here for about six months . And he 's done some work using
"[37:14] me026 | of , um ,"
"[37:18] me026 | and using that f uh , to generate speech recognition features ."
[37:23] me026 | And he did work back in Germany
"[37:30] me026 | using , um , isolated"
[37:33] me026 | digit recognition as the task . It was actually just a single - layer neural network
[37:42] me026 | in fact .
"[37:43] me026 | Um , and he tried that on I think on some Aurora data and got results that he thought seemed respectable . And"
"[37:52] me026 | uh , a real speech recognition system ."
"[37:57] me026 | So I 'll be working with him on that . And , um ,"
"[38:01] me026 | maybe I should say a little more about these features ,"
[38:03] me026 | although I don't understand them that well .
"[38:06] me026 | The I think it 's a two - stage idea . And , um ,"
[38:10] me026 | the first stage of these features
[38:12] me026 | correspond to what 's called the peripheral auditory system .
[38:19] me026 | a filter bank with a compressive nonlinearity .
[38:22] me026 | And
"[38:25] me026 | @ @ in there that isn't already modeled in something like ,"
"[38:28] me026 | um , PLP . I should learn more about that ."
"[38:31] me026 | the second stage is , um ,"
"[38:42] me026 | um ,"
"[38:46] me026 | sort of like based on diffe different w um , wavelet basis functions"
[38:51] me026 | used to analyze
[38:52] me026 | the input .
"[38:54] me026 | So th he uses analysis functions called Gabor functions ,"
"[38:59] me026 | um , which have a certain"
"[39:01] me026 | extent , um ,"
[39:06] me026 | And
"[39:07] me026 | the idea is these are used to sample ,"
"[39:09] me026 | um ,"
[39:10] me026 | the signal in a
[39:15] me026 | So you 're sampling some piece of this time - frequency plane .
"[39:19] me026 | And , um ,"
"[39:23] me026 | that ,"
"[39:24] me026 | um , is is interesting , cuz ,"
"[39:37] me026 | typically ,"
"[39:41] me026 | using this , um , basis function idea , you could have some basis functions"
[39:45] me026 | which have a lot longer time scale
"[39:48] me026 | and , um , some which have a lot shorter , and"
[39:51] me026 | so it would be like a set of multi - scale features .
"[40:01] me026 | basis functions ,"
[40:07] me026 | he actually does
[40:11] me026 | an optimal set of basis functions out of all the possible ones .
[40:12] me018 | Hmm . H
[40:14] me018 | What does he do to choose those ?
"[40:19] me026 | um ,"
"[40:28] me026 | I mean , he t he tries , um ,"
[40:33] me026 | So there are M possible subsets of this
[40:41] me026 | possible sub - vectors .
"[40:42] me026 | Whichever sub - vector ,"
"[40:44] me026 | um ,"
[40:52] me026 | the the fe feature that didn't use
[40:55] me013 | Gets thrown out .
[40:57] me026 | so we 'll throw it out and we 're gonna randomly select
[41:02] me026 | from the set of possible basis functions .
[41:05] me018 | Hmm !
[41:05] me013 | Yeah . So i so it 's actuall
[41:07] me018 | it 's a little bit like a genetic algorithm or something in a way .
"[41:09] me013 | Well , it 's it 's much simpler . But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say ."
[41:11] me018 | Greedy .
[41:16] me013 | i i
[41:18] me013 | both pieces of this are have their analogies in stuff we already do .
[41:25] me013 | at how to approach it and potentially one that 's
"[41:31] me013 | uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things . So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try ."
"[41:37] me013 | The primary features ,"
"[41:40] me013 | Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , uh , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that . You 've you 've got some ,"
[41:51] me013 | the kind of filter bank with a kind of
[41:54] me013 | quasi - log scaling .
"[41:55] me013 | Um , if you put in if you also include the RASTA in it i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain"
"[42:02] me013 | has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of ,"
"[42:08] me013 | uh , um ,"
"[42:13] me013 | uh , but it 's not exactly the same ."
"[42:15] me013 | I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different but ,"
"[42:19] me013 | um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that"
"[42:24] me013 | um ,"
[42:25] me013 | had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints .
"[42:30] me013 | So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff ,"
"[42:33] me013 | you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ?"
[42:45] me013 | And so in fact they 're multi - scale .
[43:01] me013 | Yeah . They use several of them . Yeah .
[43:02] me026 | OK .
"[43:03] me013 | Uh , I mean , you don't have to but but but , uh , Hynek has ."
"[43:07] me013 | Um ,"
[43:18] me013 | I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously some two - D and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things .
"[43:32] me013 | the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method ,"
"[43:45] me013 | uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you which I think it 's used in social sciences a lot ."
"[43:51] me013 | So , you you you you pick the best feature ."
[43:56] me013 | you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it .
"[44:01] me013 | And what what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better ,"
"[44:05] me013 | because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right"
"[44:11] me013 | set of features . Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . So ,"
"[44:24] me013 | Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features ."
"[44:28] me013 | so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this"
"[44:31] me013 | artificial question of of , uh ,"
"[44:39] me013 | I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , but it seems like a pretty good heuristic ."
"[44:44] me013 | So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff . And and and , uh ,"
[44:49] me013 | the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way .
"[44:57] me013 | Um ,"
"[44:58] me013 | so so that , um ,"
"[45:03] me013 | and these different functions ,"
"[45:11] me013 | have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth ."
"[45:16] me013 | And , um ,"
"[45:23] me013 | And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh ,"
"[45:36] me013 | uh , energy and fre and frequency . And some are emphasizing downward and"
[45:43] me013 | and so forth . So .
"[45:45] me013 | So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at . But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what"
[45:52] me013 | branch out from there .
[45:55] me013 | And his advisor is
"[45:56] me013 | here , too , at the same time . So ,"
[46:04] me013 | So .
"[46:22] me006 | So , like , if we have ,"
"[46:28] me006 | and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping ,"
[46:36] me006 | to to this this probability posterior space .
[46:36] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[46:47] me006 | some sort of pattern .
"[46:57] me006 | the , uh , um , the best features ,"
[47:03] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[47:10] me013 | Right ?
"[47:22] me013 | a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all ,"
"[47:31] me013 | because we are going into a a very powerful ,"
"[47:35] me013 | that , uh , in fact is combining over time and frequency ,"
[47:44] me026 | @ @
"[47:56] me013 | computing features is useful ,"
[48:13] me013 | you 've lost information and yet it does better
"[48:28] me013 | Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered , then we would 've completely solved this problem long ago , because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms ."
[48:39] me006 | Right .
"[48:43] me013 | Uh ,"
[48:57] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:04] me013 | not infinite but a lot , and then compared to the number parameters and it it , uh it just doesn't do nearly as well ."
[49:22] me013 | So .
"[49:30] me006 | Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing ."
[49:32] me013 | Yeah .
"[49:34] me006 | Um ,"
"[49:35] me006 | so , uh , the big picture is k"
"[49:37] me006 | um , come up with a set of ,"
"[49:39] me006 | uh , intermediate categories , then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition ,"
"[49:44] me006 | and , um , improve speech recognition in that way ."
"[49:59] me006 | methods that can help me find ,"
"[50:01] me006 | um , a set of intermediate categories of speech that , uh , will help me to discriminate later down the line ."
[50:16] me006 | train train an ordinary neural net
"[50:19] me006 | uh , to learn the posterior probabilities of phones ."
"[50:22] me006 | And so ,"
"[50:31] me006 | And so , um , what what are these patterns ? I don't know ."
[50:33] me018 | Hmm .
[50:38] me006 | to look at those patterns
"[50:54] me006 | um , that the neural net learns ."
[50:58] me006 | Yeah .
"[51:02] me013 | relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ? So ,"
"[51:25] me013 | is just what he 's talking about doing , too ,"
[51:27] me013 | except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond
"[51:33] me013 | to these uh , uh , what these"
[51:36] me013 | sub - features are are are are showing you .
"[51:39] me013 | And , um ,"
"[51:41] me013 | the other difference is that ,"
"[51:43] me013 | um ,"
"[51:44] me013 | he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting ,"
[51:47] me013 | which means that he 's constraining himself
"[51:49] me013 | to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ?"
"[51:55] me013 | And whereas in in this case you 're saying "" let 's just do it unconstrained "" ."
[52:00] me013 | So they 're they 're really pretty related and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll
[52:04] me013 | see the the connections a little better and
[52:05] me026 | Hmm .
[52:08] me013 | connect them .
[52:17] me006 | some patterns of intermediate categories .
"[52:20] me006 | Um , the other one was ,"
"[52:23] me006 | um , to ,"
"[52:25] me006 | uh , come up with a a a model um , a graphical model ,"
[52:30] me006 | that treats the intermediate categories
"[52:37] me006 | but that through ,"
"[52:46] me006 | we have learned something about these these latent , um latent variables which happen to correspond to intermediate categories ."
"[52:56] me006 | Yeah , and so those are the the two directions that I 'm I 'm looking into right now . And , uh ,"
[53:10] me013 | OK .
[53:12] me013 | Should we do our digits and
[53:14] me013 | get ou get our treats ?
"[53:18] me013 | Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them . We do the digits and then we get our treats ."
[57:00] me018 | OK .
[57:01] me013 | OK .

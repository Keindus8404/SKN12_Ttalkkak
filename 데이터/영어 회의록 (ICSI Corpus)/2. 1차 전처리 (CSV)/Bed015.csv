[00:00] fe004 | I 'm What ?
"[00:02] fe004 | Really ? Oh , that 's horrible !"
[00:04] fe004 | Disincentive !
[00:08] fe004 | Hello ? Hello ? Which am I ?
"[00:09] fn050 | Uh , yeah ."
[00:11] me010 | Oh right .
[00:12] me003 | Alright . Good .
[00:13] fe004 | Channel fi OK .
[00:20] fe004 | OK .
"[00:30] fe004 | So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um ,"
"[00:43] fe004 | And there 's two things . And so one on one side is on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism . It 's just one sheet ."
[00:51] fn050 | The wait .
"[00:53] me045 | This is just one sheet , right ?"
[00:54] fn050 | Ah ! Just one sheet . OK .
"[00:55] fe004 | It 's just a Nothing else . Um ,"
"[00:56] fn050 | Front , back ."
[00:59] fe004 | Enough to go around ? OK .
"[01:00] fe004 | And in some ways it 's it 's it 's very similar to There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I don't think everyone here has seen"
[01:09] fe004 | all of this .
"[01:10] fe004 | So , uh , I 'm not sure where"
[01:15] fe004 | to begin .
[01:19] fe004 | it 's only slightly more stable than it was before .
[01:21] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:21] fe004 | And , um , after a little bit more"
"[01:24] fe004 | discussion and especially like Keith and I I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more ."
[01:27] me045 | Yeah .
"[01:32] fe004 | let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's ,"
"[01:37] fe004 | I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um to people ."
"[01:41] fe004 | OK , so the top block is just sort of a sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um ,"
[01:48] fe004 | listings of the kinds of things that we can have .
"[01:50] fe004 | And certain things that have , um ,"
"[01:54] fe004 | There there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have"
"[02:01] fe004 | a type included in this line . So something like , um Well , there 's an example the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So ,"
[02:02] me010 | Right .
"[02:13] fe004 | Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning ."
"[02:19] fe004 | Um , and then they say the key word construction and they have some name ."
"[02:21] me010 | Oh , I see . So so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct OK , that 's fine ."
"[02:26] fe004 | Yeah , right ."
"[02:28] fe004 | OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um ,"
"[02:36] fe004 | one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gonna turn out to m be certainly the most common kind ."
"[02:42] fe004 | But in general instead of the word "" construct "" , th here you might have "" meaning "" or "" form "" as well ."
[02:48] fe004 | OK ? So if there 's some element that doesn't that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning .
"[02:53] fe004 | OK , um ,"
"[02:55] fe004 | the main change with the constructs which each of which has ,"
"[02:58] fe004 | um , the key word "" construct "" and then some name ,"
[03:04] fe004 | it 's pro it 's often sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example
"[03:10] fe004 | whatever I have here is gonna be a form of the word "" throw "" , or it 's gonna be a form of the word ,"
"[03:14] fe004 | you know , I don't know , "" happy "" , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word"
"[03:18] fe004 | or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say "" I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here "" or "" I need a directional specifier here "" ."
[03:25] fe004 | So - uh you could have a j a actual type here .
"[03:28] fe004 | Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is"
"[03:42] fe004 | you know , the um ,"
"[03:45] fe004 | I I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , "" I "" , meaning category is what 's there ."
[03:49] fe004 | The the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair
"[03:53] fe004 | and , um ,"
"[03:55] fe004 | sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need ."
"[04:03] fe004 | It 's it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there . And usually it has formal"
[04:05] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:09] fe004 | um , considerations that will go along with it . And then"
[04:10] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:12] fe004 | uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about ,"
"[04:18] fe004 | So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion ,"
"[04:21] fe004 | you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um ,"
"[04:25] fe004 | "" the big th "" , you you know , "" the big the tall dark man "" , you know , "" walked into the room "" . But"
[04:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:32] fe004 | because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate"
"[04:38] fe004 | nominal ,"
"[04:40] fe004 | and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression ."
"[04:46] fe004 | Um ,"
[04:47] fe004 | so I don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So .
[04:56] fe004 | at least Yeah . None of these examples have anything
[04:59] fe004 | different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to
"[05:02] fe004 | any of the , um ,"
"[05:05] fe004 | sort of available elements and scope ,"
[05:10] fe004 | to say something about the relation .
"[05:12] fe004 | And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block ,"
"[05:17] fe004 | um , we dropped like the little F subscript . The F subscripts refer to the "" form "" piece of the construct ."
[05:23] me010 | Good .
"[05:31] fe004 | if I just said "" Name one "" then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc Which which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate"
"[05:40] fe004 | "" here I mean the meaningful for some reason "" ."
"[05:42] fe004 | Right ? Or Actually it 's more often that ,"
"[05:44] fe004 | only to handle this one special case of , you know , "" George and Jerry walk into the room in that order "" . So we have a few funny things where"
[05:49] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[05:51] fe004 | something in the meaning might refer to something in the form .
[05:54] fe004 | But but s we 're not gonna really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on .
"[06:01] fe004 | OK , and so"
"[06:02] fe004 | in terms of the the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation but in form you might also have"
"[06:10] fe004 | a value binding . You know , you could say that , um ,"
"[06:14] fe004 | you know , "" name - one dot "" , t you know , "" number equals "" , you know ,"
"[06:18] fe004 | a plural or something like that . There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below but I mean"
"[06:27] fe004 | value fillers , right ?"
"[06:29] fe004 | OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just are just bindings . There was talk of changing the name of that ."
[06:34] fe004 | And Johno and I I you you and I can like fight about that if you like ? but about
"[06:38] fe004 | changing it to "" semantic n effects "" , which I thought was a little bit too"
"[06:44] fe004 | order - biased and "" semantic bindings "" , which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have"
[06:45] me003 | Th -
"[06:49] fe004 | only bindings . And so it was an issue whether constraints um , there were some linguists who reacted against "" constraints "" , saying , "" oh , if it 's not used for matching ,"
"[06:58] fe004 | then it shouldn't be called a constraint "" . But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not ."
"[07:03] fe004 | Right ? Cuz there are I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for"
"[07:09] fe004 | actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes ."
"[07:11] me010 | Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy ."
[07:17] me045 | Yeah .
[07:17] me010 | So that whether or not
"[07:18] fe004 | Yeah , yeah ."
[07:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[07:24] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:27] fe004 | Yeah , uh , there was one time when when Hans explained why"
"[07:30] fe004 | "" constraints "" was a misleading word for him . And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term , which was just an interesting coincidence . Um , but ,"
[07:32] me010 | Yep .
[07:42] me010 | It 's g it 's gone .
"[07:48] mn015 | Well , you know what ? If you have an "" if - then "" phrase , do you know what the "" then "" phrase is called ?"
[07:49] me010 | Th -
"[07:53] fe004 | What ? Con - uh , a consequent ?"
[07:56] mn015 | Yeah .
"[07:57] fe004 | Yeah , but it 's not an "" if - then "" ."
"[07:58] me010 | I know . Anyway , so the other the other strategy you guys could consider is"
[08:01] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:05] me010 | when you don't know what word to put , you could put no word ,"
"[08:10] fe004 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[08:12] me003 | So that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down down here ?
"[08:16] fe004 | Oh , oops ! No . That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it . So , I 'm sorry . I didn't mean that one 's an in unintentional ."
[08:20] me010 | OK .
"[08:24] fe004 | Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent cuz I 'm not sure yet . Here , I actually it was just a mistake ."
"[08:28] me003 | Th - so this definitely should be "" semantic constraints "" down at the bottom ?"
[08:30] me045 | Sure .
[08:30] fe004 | Yeah .
[08:31] me003 | OK .
"[08:34] me010 | Oh , whatever ."
[08:38] me010 | Or wh
[08:40] me010 | That - b Right . Minor min problem OK .
"[08:41] fe004 | Minor point . OK , um ,"
[08:42] me045 | Extremely .
"[08:44] fe004 | so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . And the bottom block"
"[08:54] fe004 | and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types . Oh , one thing I should mention is about "" designates "" . I think I 'm actually"
[09:06] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[09:08] fe004 | this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic
"[09:11] fe004 | change , which is that "" designates "" isn't"
[09:14] fe004 | only something for the semantics to worry about now .
[09:16] me010 | Good .
"[09:16] fe004 | So we want s "" designates "" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects"
"[09:22] fe004 | but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on ."
"[09:25] fe004 | So for instance , if some other construction says ,"
"[09:27] fe004 | you know , "" are you of type is this part of type whatever "" , um , the "" designates "" tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . OK , so if you have like "" the big red ball "" ,"
"[09:36] fe004 | you know , you wanna know if there 's an object or a noun . Well , ball is going to be the designated"
"[09:41] fe004 | sort of element of that kind of phrase . Um ,"
[09:41] me045 | Mmm .
"[09:51] fe004 | to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? So the ball is the head"
"[09:56] fe004 | of the phrase , "" the r the "" , um , "" big red ball "" , and the entity denoted by the word "" ball "" is sort of the semantic head in some ways of of this sort of , um ,"
[10:05] fe004 | in interesting larger element .
"[10:05] me010 | A a and the Yeah . And there 's uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . And and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right ."
[10:12] me045 | Yeah .
[10:14] me045 | Yeah . That 's the idea . Yeah .
"[10:14] fe004 | Right , right ."
"[10:16] fe004 | And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form"
[10:25] fe004 | having to be at the end of that decision . So that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in .
[10:26] me010 | Right .
"[10:32] me010 | Oh , w Oh . I don't know . Were you finished ?"
"[10:35] fe004 | Um , there was a list of things that isn't included but you you can you can ask a question . That might"
"[10:40] me010 | OK . So , i if I understand this"
[10:40] fe004 | @ @ it .
[10:49] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[10:54] me010 | we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type
[11:00] fe004 | Right .
"[11:02] fe004 | Well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that ,"
"[11:06] fe004 | Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . So I don't know what a form"
"[11:12] me010 | Oh , I see . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm sorry , you 're right . A construction type ."
[11:13] fe004 | type is . Yeah .
[11:18] fe004 | Right .
"[11:19] fe004 | A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning"
"[11:26] fe004 | bit by it . So you could say "" construct of type whatever designates something "" ."
[11:30] me010 | Yeah .
"[11:30] fe004 | But that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . I don't think that"
"[11:34] fe004 | it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time I think ."
[11:40] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:41] fe004 | Um ,"
"[11:43] fe004 | I I don't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know that 's kind of weird ."
"[11:50] me010 | No , no , no , I don't think so . I think that you 'll you 'll do fine . In fact ,"
"[11:54] me010 | these are , um ,"
"[11:58] me010 | as long as as Mark isn't around , these are form constraints . So a nominal expression is uh , the fact that it 's animate ,"
"[12:05] me010 | is semantic . The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . And I think that 's just fine ."
[12:06] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[12:12] me045 | Yeah .
"[12:15] fe004 | Right , right ."
"[12:16] me045 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:18] fe004 | Which is fine , yeah ."
"[12:19] me045 | It 's that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , I I don't know if I ever explained this but the point of , um ,"
[12:19] me010 | Yeah .
"[12:31] me045 | because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object"
"[12:36] me045 | just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um ,"
"[12:45] me045 | that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? So you wanna , you know you sort of have this problem like"
"[12:49] me045 | "" OK , well , I 'll put the word "" ,"
"[12:51] me045 | uh , let 's say , the word "" dog "" ,"
[12:53] me045 | you know . And that has to come right after the verb cuz we know verb meets its object .
[12:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:56] me045 | And then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have "" the "" preceding a noun . And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet"
[13:04] me010 | Right .
"[13:04] me045 | the designatum . And you could get , you know , "" the kicked dog "" or something like that , meaning "" kicked the dog "" ."
[13:09] me010 | Right .
[13:14] me010 | That I I have no problem with it at all . I think it 's fine .
[13:15] me045 | It - it Yeah .
[13:16] fe004 | Yeah .
"[13:17] fe004 | Right , n s"
[13:20] me045 | Yeah .
"[13:23] me045 | I mean , we we we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh with , a p I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of of phrase structure . But , uh ,"
[13:31] me010 | Right .
"[13:35] me045 | I just know that this is Like , we didn't originally have in mind that , uh that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form . Um ,"
[13:42] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[13:42] me010 | But they do .
[13:45] me045 | At least in English .
[13:46] me010 | Yeah .
[13:50] me045 | Yeah .
[13:50] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:51] fe004 | did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like ,"
[14:00] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:01] fe004 | well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations ,"
"[14:06] fe004 | those could intersect with these in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject ,"
"[14:11] fe004 | verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions ."
[14:11] me010 | Right .
"[14:16] fe004 | And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . But you know , for now , I mean ,"
"[14:21] fe004 | uh , you know ."
"[14:23] fe004 | M moving it to another place , right ."
[14:24] me045 | Yeah .
"[14:27] fe004 | But there does basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ? So , yeah ."
[14:29] me010 | Right .
[14:34] fe004 | Robert 's not happy now ?
[14:35] mn015 | No !
"[14:36] fe004 | Oh , OK ."
"[14:36] me010 | OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair ."
[14:43] fe004 | Yes .
"[14:44] me010 | Instead of just the meaning . And that aside from some terminology ,"
[14:45] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[14:49] me010 | that 's basically it .
[14:52] fe004 | Right .
[14:52] me010 | I just want to b I 'm I 'm asking .
[14:53] fe004 | Yep .
[14:53] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[14:54] me045 | Yeah .
"[14:54] fe004 | Yeah , um , the"
"[14:57] fe004 | un sort of the un - addressed questions in this , um , definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about ."
[15:00] me010 | Yeah .
"[15:04] fe004 | Here are just bindings but ,"
[15:08] me010 | The whole the mental space thing is clearly not here .
"[15:10] fe004 | Right ? So there 's going to be some extra you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now ."
[15:12] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:15] me010 | By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back . So , uh , the the mental space thing . Um , obviously ,"
[15:17] fe004 | Uh
[15:18] fe004 | Yeah .
[15:19] fe004 | OK .
[15:22] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[15:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[15:37] me045 | So what 's the what 's the time frame ? I forgot again when you 're going away for
[15:41] me045 | how long ?
"[15:41] mn015 | Just , uh , as a sort of a mental bridge , I 'm not I 'm skipping fourth of July ."
[15:46] me045 | OK .
"[15:47] mn015 | So , uh , right afterwards I 'm back ."
[15:49] me045 | OK .
"[15:50] fe004 | What ? You 're missing like the premier American holiday ? What 's the point of spending a year here ? So , anyway ."
"[15:55] mn015 | Uh , I 've had it often enough ."
[15:57] me003 | Well he w he went to college here .
"[15:58] fe004 | Oh , yeah , I forgot . Oops . Sorry . OK ."
[15:59] me010 | Yeah .
[16:01] me010 | And furthermore it 's well worth missing .
[16:01] fe004 | Not in California .
"[16:04] fe004 | I like spending fourth of July in other countries , whenever I can ."
[16:07] me010 | Right .
"[16:08] me010 | OK , so that 's great ."
"[16:12] fe004 | Oh , so there was one question that came out ."
"[16:17] fe004 | so something like "" past "" which i you know , we think is a very"
[16:21] me010 | Right .
[16:23] me010 | Right .
"[16:24] fe004 | this event takes place before speech time "" , OK , is what this means ."
"[16:29] fe004 | it is also considered a mental space , you know , by , you know , lots of people around here . So"
[16:31] me010 | Right .
[16:33] me010 | Right .
"[16:34] fe004 | there 's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say "" in France , blah - blah - blah "" , and you have to build up you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery ,"
[16:39] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[16:44] fe004 | whereas past is a very conventionalized one and we sort of know what it means
"[16:47] fe004 | but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to , you know , unload all the notation every time we see"
"[16:51] fe004 | that it 's past tense . So , you know , we could think of our uh , just like X - schema "" walk "" refers to this complicated structure ,"
[16:51] me010 | Right .
[16:57] me010 | I think that 's exactly right .
"[17:02] fe004 | so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it you know , having it both ways , right ? So , i i"
[17:04] me010 | Yeah .
"[17:05] me010 | Yeah . No , I think I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details but"
[17:07] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[17:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[17:09] me010 | my intuition would be that that 's right .
"[17:10] fe004 | Yeah , OK ."
[17:12] mn015 | Do you want to do the same for space ?
[17:13] fe004 | Wha - sorry ?
[17:15] mn015 | Space ?
[17:16] fe004 | Space ?
[17:17] mn015 | Here ?
[17:18] mn015 | Now ?
"[17:18] fe004 | Oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Same thing . So there are very conventionalized like"
[17:21] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:24] fe004 | deictic ones , right ?"
"[17:25] fe004 | And then I think for other spaces that you introduce ,"
"[17:29] fe004 | you could just attach y whatever You could build up an appropriately uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence ."
[17:31] mn015 | Hmm .
[17:33] me010 | Yeah .
[17:35] me045 | N
[17:40] fe004 | Yeah . Right . Mm - hmm .
"[17:47] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Yeah . So time and space . Um , we 'll we 'll get that on the other side a little , like very minimally . There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place . And"
[17:53] me010 | Good .
"[17:56] fe004 | you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , there are relative things that , you know , you relate"
[18:05] fe004 | the event in time and space to where you are now .
"[18:08] fe004 | If there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job , like or somebody 's job anyway . I 'm gonna point to at random ."
[18:12] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:15] me045 | Yeah . Yeah . I mean , I 'm I 'm s curious about how much of"
"[18:21] me045 | the mental I mean , I 'm not sure that"
"[18:23] me045 | the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things , is gonna have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff ."
"[18:30] me045 | You know , um , basically"
[18:41] me045 | assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different
"[18:46] me045 | world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those ."
"[18:51] me045 | The , um the construction that you actually get is just gonna sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going ,"
[18:59] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:59] me045 | um , you 're supposed to add structure to . So "" in France , uh , Watergate wouldn't have hurt Nixon "" or something like that ."
"[19:05] me045 | Um , well , you say , "" alright , I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe "" or something like that . The information in the sentence tells you that much but it doesn't tell you"
"[19:27] me045 | like the question is for example , what does "" Watergate "" refer to there ?"
"[19:30] me045 | Does it , you know does it refer to , um if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say "" Watergate "" you 're referring to "" a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France "" ."
"[19:40] me045 | But in a different context , "" oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't you know , Watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the US and in France it wouldn't have hurt him at all "" ."
"[19:51] me045 | we 're now talking about the real one , and the "" would """
"[19:52] fe004 | They 're real , right ."
[19:58] fe004 | I see right .
"[19:59] me045 | What 's hypothetical about this world . In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away"
[20:04] fe004 | Hmm .
[20:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[20:09] fe004 | Right .
[20:13] me010 | Correct .
[20:15] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:16] me045 | I don't know where that sits then , sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant ."
[20:18] mn015 | Hmm .
[20:24] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:25] fe004 | give you sort of the the most basi th those we I think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ? There are sort of a relatively limited number . And then"
[20:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:32] fe004 | how they interact with some extra thing like "" in France "" or "" if such - and - such "" ,"
[20:35] me045 | Yeah .
"[20:37] fe004 | that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can You know , one is a more specific version"
[20:44] me045 | Yeah .
[20:50] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[20:53] me045 | Yeah .
"[20:56] me045 | But the whole point of the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about , uh , mental spaces , and blending , and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence . You know ,"
"[21:04] me045 | there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . It just says , "" Here . Add this structure to this space . "" and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite"
"[21:14] me045 | open . An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , "" what the space configuration is at the time of utterance "" ."
[21:15] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[21:16] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[21:25] me010 | I think that 's right .
[21:29] me010 | Not k I th
"[21:30] me010 | I don't think it 's completely right . I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b the form did constrain the meaning ,"
[21:40] me045 | Yeah .
"[21:45] me045 | Sure , but like what what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France ? That is not there is nothing about that in the in the sentence really ."
[21:52] fe004 | That 's OK . We usually don't know the point of
[21:54] me045 | Yeah .
[21:55] fe004 | the sentence at all . But we know what it 's trying to say . We we know that it 's what predication it 's setting up . That 's all .
[21:57] me045 | Y yeah .
[21:57] me010 | Yeah .
"[21:59] me010 | But but bottom line , I agree with you , that that that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f"
[21:59] me045 | Yeah .
[22:01] me045 | Yeah .
"[22:06] fe004 | Purely linguistic cues , right ? So ."
"[22:06] me010 | uh , the purely form cues , yeah ."
[22:08] fe004 | Mmm .
"[22:22] me045 | Yeah . Oh , yeah ."
"[22:22] me010 | uh , I I mean , that that 's my feeling that that these are really hard"
[22:24] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[22:27] me045 | Yeah .
"[22:28] me010 | uh , problems that decide exactly what what 's going on ."
[22:32] me045 | Yeah .
[22:34] me010 | OK .
"[22:35] fe004 | OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is"
[22:38] fe004 | there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like
[22:42] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:42] me010 | Uh , right , right , right ."
"[22:43] fe004 | Um , for now I 'm gonna say like "" profile "" 's often used like two uses that come to mind immediately ."
"[22:48] fe004 | One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . So "" hypotenuse "" , you profiled this guy against the background of the right t right triangle . OK ."
[22:56] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:58] fe004 | And the second use , um , is in FrameNet. It 's slightly different . Oh , I was asking Hans about this . They use it to really mean ,"
"[23:04] fe004 | um , this in a frame th this is the profiles on the these are the ones that are required . So they have to be"
[23:14] fe004 | I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive but they 're they 're different meanings . So the closest thing so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation .
[23:16] me010 | Right .
[23:17] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[23:28] me010 | FrameNet. I didn't know that .
[23:32] me010 | Yeah .
"[23:36] me010 | Right , OK ."
"[23:40] me010 | Well , I 'll check ."
"[23:40] fe004 | and may maybe he 's wrong . Anyway , so"
[23:43] fe004 | I think the the
"[23:45] fe004 | "" designate "" that we have in terms of meaning"
"[23:47] fe004 | is really the "" highlight this thing with respect to everything else "" . OK ? So this is what what it means ."
[23:49] me010 | Right .
[23:51] fe004 | But the second one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it ? We don't have a notation for it
[23:57] fe004 | but we might want one . So for example we 've talked about
"[24:00] fe004 | if you 're talking about the lexical item "" walk "" , you know it 's an action . Well , it also has"
"[24:06] fe004 | this idea it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody 's gonna do the walking . Or if you talk about an adjective "" red "" , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red ."
"[24:15] fe004 | So we used to use the notation "" with """
[24:18] me010 | Right .
"[24:30] me010 | N no , no . Well , uh , th critically they 're not required syntactically . Often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff ."
[24:34] fe004 | Right .
"[24:35] fe004 | Right , right . Yeah , um , definitely . So , um ,"
"[24:39] fe004 | "" in "" was a good example . If you walk "" in "" , like well ,"
"[24:42] fe004 | in what ? You know , like you have to have the So so it 's only semantically is it it is still required , say , by simulation time though to have"
[24:48] me010 | Right .
[24:51] fe004 | the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation . I don't know if that 's something we need to spa to to like
[24:56] fe004 | say ever as part of the requirement ? or the construction ? or not . We 'll we 'll again defer .
"[25:02] fe004 | Have it construed , is that the idea ? Just point at Robert . Whenever I 'm confused just point to him . You tell me . OK ."
"[25:03] me010 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[25:07] me010 | Right . It 's it 's his thesis , right ? Anyway ,"
"[25:10] me010 | right , yeah , w this is gonna be a b you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever ."
"[25:16] fe004 | OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I we have thoughts about those as well . Um ,"
[25:17] me010 | Yeah .
[25:18] me010 | Great .
[25:20] fe004 | the I w I would just s some of this is just like
"[25:23] fe004 | my you know , by fiat . I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . I don't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it ."
[25:26] me045 | Yeah .
[25:27] me010 | I that 's fine .
"[25:29] fe004 | I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress . So , s"
[25:34] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:40] fe004 | basically this is the information structure . OK , it 's like uh , it 's not it might be that there 's a syntactic ,"
[25:42] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[25:54] me045 | Mmm .
[25:56] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:58] fe004 | tend to think that , whatever , "" into the room "" is sort of like the more focused kind of thing . And when you , uh ,"
[25:58] me045 | Yeah .
"[26:03] fe004 | uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element"
"[26:14] fe004 | the sort of like import or whatever of of this thing . Uh , so so I think that 's kind of nice to keep "" focus "" being an information structure term ."
"[26:21] fe004 | "" Stress "" I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . So , um ,"
"[26:33] fe004 | uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device . You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever . Um ,"
[26:38] me045 | Yeah .
"[26:40] fe004 | t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect which is , "" Oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value"
[26:55] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:57] fe004 | my now - classic example of saying , "" Oh , he did go to the meeting ? "" , that was my way of saying as opposed to , you know , "" Oh , he didn't g "" or "" There was a meeting ? "" I think that was the example that was"
[27:00] me045 | Yeah .
[27:04] me045 | Yeah .
[27:05] me045 | Yeah .
"[27:05] fe004 | caught on by the linguists immediately . And so , um , the like if you said he you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're ,"
[27:13] fe004 | c
"[27:14] fe004 | focusing , whatever , on , uh "" he walked to the meeting "" as opposed to "" he ran "" , or "" he did walk to the meeting "" as opposed to "" he didn't walk "" . You know , so"
[27:14] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[27:20] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:22] fe004 | we need to have a notation for that which , um , I think that 's still in progress . So , sort of I 'm still working it out ."
"[27:28] fe004 | But it did one one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that"
"[27:33] fe004 | I couldn't think of a good way to say "" here are the possible things that you could focus on "" , cuz it seems like any entity"
"[27:40] fe004 | in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus ."
[27:44] me010 | Mmm .
"[27:48] fe004 | But I think one the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ? So for instance , you could say it 's"
"[27:53] fe004 | the the tense on this as opposed to , um , the the action . OK . Or it 's uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things ,"
"[28:00] fe004 | or stress this value as opposed to other things . So , um ,"
[28:05] fe004 | it 's it is kind of like a profile profile - background
[28:08] fe004 | thing but I I can't think of like the limited set of
[28:12] fe004 | possible meanings that you would that you would focu light highlight
"[28:23] fe004 | later on . Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements ."
"[28:28] fe004 | For instance , you Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements and that 's probably relevant for the like "" where is "" ,"
"[28:34] fe004 | you know , "" the castle "" kind of thing ? Because you might want to say that , um ,"
[28:35] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:40] fe004 | location or cert certain WH words bring you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , "" I don't know the identity of this thing "" kind of way on certain elements . So ."
"[28:50] fe004 | OK . Anyway . So that 's onl there are there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it 's most I think it 's this is ,"
"[28:58] fe004 | you know , the current current form . Other things we didn't"
"[29:03] fe004 | well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . You know , a a nominal expression . And , um ,"
[29:06] me045 | Yeah .
[29:10] me045 | Yeah .
"[29:11] fe004 | I mean , we should have put an example of this and we could do that later . But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though , that ,"
[29:13] me045 | Yeah .
"[29:26] fe004 | Uh , you know , they they have constituents ,"
"[29:28] fe004 | right ? So you can like nest things when you need to ,"
[29:30] fe004 | but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way .
[29:40] fe004 | properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent - based grammar . So that 's I think that 's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for and so far it 's worked out OK . So .
[29:46] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[29:48] me010 | Good .
[29:49] fe004 | OK .
[29:51] mn015 | I can say two things about the f
[29:58] mn015 | This my f
[29:58] fe004 | As a word ?
"[30:04] mn015 | canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence , you can"
"[30:09] mn015 | find out where a certain stress is and say , "" hey , that 's my focus exponent . """
[30:14] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:14] me045 | Right .
"[30:15] mn015 | It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is . If it 's just that thing ,"
[30:18] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:20] fe004 | Or the constituent that it falls in .
[30:23] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:24] fe004 | You mean t forget about stress , the form"
"[30:27] mn015 | The form bit because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes ."
[30:27] me045 | Yeah .
[30:27] fe004 | cue ? OK .
[30:47] fe004 | Yeah .
[30:51] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:54] mn015 | it 's absurd .
"[30:57] me045 | Yeah , I mean , I I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying"
"[31:03] me045 | the information structure focus of the sentence and then ,"
[31:05] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Ways that you can get it come from th right .
[31:14] mn015 | Or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is .
[31:16] me045 | y Yeah .
[31:20] me045 | Yeah .
"[31:20] mn015 | But , uh , if you don't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways ,"
[31:21] fe004 | Right .
"[31:23] fe004 | That 's fine , yeah . Mm - hmm ."
[31:30] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:30] mn015 | is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't ."
[31:42] mn015 | And then you 're left with a couple three .
[31:44] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[31:54] mn015 | anything . So .
[31:57] mn015 | You know .
"[31:58] fe004 | OK . Well , uh , yeah , I wouldn't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in in absence of all the oth you need all the other information I guess ."
[31:59] mn015 | u u
"[32:04] mn015 | But it 's it 's what it uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . I mean , because"
[32:08] fe004 | Yeah .
"[32:09] mn015 | you can just say whatever stuff , "" i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever , both , and so forth . """
"[32:15] fe004 | Mm - hmm , mm - hmm ."
[32:16] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[32:18] fe004 | Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture .
"[32:21] me010 | Yeah , so b b but I think the poi I 'm not sure I understand but here 's what I th think is going on . That"
"[32:26] me010 | if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches ,"
"[32:31] me010 | it the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus ."
"[32:37] fe004 | W uh ,"
[32:40] fe004 | I 'm not sure about that . Or it might limit it cert certainly constrains
[32:41] me010 | OK .
"[32:44] me010 | Uh k uh , at at the very least it constrai"
"[32:44] fe004 | the possibilities of focus . I think that 's that 's , th that 's certainly true . And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ?"
"[32:50] me010 | Oh , uh , for sure , yes . There are constrai yeah , it 's not every but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations"
[32:52] fe004 | Yeah .
[32:57] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[32:59] me010 | that you need to take into account in order to decide which what is being focused .
[33:00] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[33:01] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[33:04] mn015 | So we talked about that a little bit this morning .
"[33:08] mn015 | "" John is on the bus , not Nancy . "" So that 's focuses on John . "" John is on the bus and not on the train . "" "" John is on the bus "" versus "" John is on the train . "" And "" John is on the bus "" versus "" was "" , and e"
[33:10] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[33:12] fe004 | Hmm .
[33:12] me010 | Right .
[33:17] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[33:17] me010 | Right .
[33:19] fe004 | Right .
"[33:24] mn015 | "" it 's the bu "" so e"
[33:24] me010 | Right .
"[33:24] me010 | Yeah , all all of those . Yeah ."
[33:25] fe004 | Right .
[33:26] mn015 | All of these and will we have u is it all the same constructions ? Just with a different foc focus constituent ?
[33:36] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[33:37] fe004 | the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some whatever is predicated anyway
"[33:41] fe004 | should be the same set of constructions . So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions . So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else ."
[33:48] me010 | Yeah .
[33:49] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:50] me010 | So , the question is actually oh , I 'm sorry , go ahead , finish ."
"[33:50] fe004 | And it would yeah , and it w and that would have to uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . But it 's still is limited possibility ."
[33:59] mn015 | Hmm .
"[33:59] fe004 | So that should , you know , interact with it should overlap with whatever other construction is there ."
[34:02] mn015 | Yeah .
"[34:03] me010 | S s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something ."
[34:10] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[34:21] me010 | Right .
[34:27] me010 | So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . OK .
"[34:28] fe004 | Yeah , and , infer and I don't have I don't have a great way or great examples but I think that something like that is probably gonna be , uh , more more what we have to do . But , um , OK , that was one comment . And you had another one ?"
[34:29] me010 | I 'll - I 'll wait .
[34:32] me010 | OK .
[34:36] mn015 | Hmm .
[34:36] me010 | OK .
[34:46] fe004 | How about what ?
"[34:57] fe004 | Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . There 's there 's definitely , um ,"
[35:05] mn015 | Mmm .
[35:10] fe004 | I n I don't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions
"[35:14] fe004 | on like focus , right ? Um , topic it seems kind of you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing ."
[35:18] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:18] me045 | Japanese has this though . You know . Yeah , that 's what "" wa "" is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . It doesn't always have to be the subject ."
[35:20] fe004 | Topic marker ?
[35:21] mn015 | Yeah .
[35:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[35:24] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[35:25] fe004 | Right .
"[35:26] fe004 | So again , information structure has a topic slot . And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it . Um , I think I stuck it in . Um , and"
[35:29] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:32] me010 | Yep , it 's there ."
"[35:35] fe004 | one thing that I didn't do consistently , um , is when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . I think I have an idea of what it should be but th"
"[35:44] fe004 | you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . I forg it 'll be a frame . You know , it 'll be it 'll be another predication or it 'll be ,"
"[35:53] fe004 | um , I don't know , some value from from some something , some variable and scope or something like that ,"
"[35:57] fe004 | or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . OK , so well that 's should we flip over to the other side officially then ? I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this"
"[36:01] mn015 | Mm - hmm , hmm ."
"[36:02] me045 | OK , side one ."
"[36:09] fe004 | doesn't include something which mi mi may have some effect on on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context"
"[36:18] fe004 | record , right ? So I didn't I I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have ,"
[36:25] me010 | Right .
"[36:31] fe004 | I I changed the name of um it used to be "" entities "" . So you see it 's "" scenario "" ,"
"[36:35] fe004 | "" referent "" and "" discourse segment "" . And "" scenario "" is essentially what kind of what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots"
"[36:44] fe004 | from which you would draw draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ?"
"[36:49] fe004 | Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever ."
[36:55] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:57] fe004 | The middle thing used to be "" entities "" because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be"
"[37:06] fe004 | grammatically specifiable information about a referent uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So "" Harry walked into the room "" ,"
"[37:14] fe004 | "" Harry "" and "" room "" , you know , the room th but they would be represented in this list somehow ."
"[37:18] fe004 | And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot ."
"[37:21] fe004 | Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be could be drawn in . But the important things for"
"[37:30] fe004 | grammatical purposes are for things like number , gender , um ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening ,"
"[37:43] fe004 | linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are are they doing something serially or is it like ,"
"[37:56] fe004 | Um , and then the "" status "" I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between"
"[38:04] fe004 | different status . So , th the the big com and and finally "" discourse segment "" is about"
"[38:10] fe004 | sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things ."
"[38:14] fe004 | So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity the entity 's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might that might be sort of a general ,"
"[38:28] fe004 | I don't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to ."
"[38:31] fe004 | And I changed to "" reference "" cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular"
"[38:36] fe004 | referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gonna be"
[38:43] fe004 | feminine or something like that . And and
"[38:46] fe004 | these could actually just point to , you know , the the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um ,"
"[38:55] fe004 | uh , th there 's there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about ."
"[38:59] fe004 | I almost listed "" discourse status "" as a slot where you could say"
"[39:02] fe004 | it 's active . You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be ,"
"[39:08] fe004 | um , accessible , inaccessible . It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . And"
[39:10] me045 | Yeah .
"[39:15] fe004 | the thing is that that I noticed that that , um , list was sort of"
"[39:19] fe004 | discourse dependent . It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been , or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . So ."
[39:25] me045 | Yeah .
"[39:28] me010 | Uh yeah , well there there seems to be context properties . Yeah ."
"[39:30] fe004 | Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually"
"[39:40] me010 | Well , uh , uh , this is recursive cuz until we do the"
[39:44] fe004 | Yeah .
"[39:45] me010 | uh , mental space"
"[39:47] me010 | story , we 're not quite sure Th - th which is fine . We 'll just we 'll j"
[39:50] me010 | we just don't know yet .
[39:51] fe004 | Right .
"[39:52] fe004 | So I so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific ."
"[40:01] fe004 | Um , and I left the slot , "" predications "" , open because you can have , um , things like "" the guy I know from school "" . Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's"
[40:10] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:20] fe004 | unclear whether I mean , you could just have in your scenario , "" here are some extra few things that are true "" , right ?"
[40:25] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:30] fe004 | but it 's used for identification purposes . So it 's it 's a little bit different from just saying "" all these things are true from my utterance "" ."
[40:31] me045 | Yeah .
[40:31] me010 | Right .
[40:35] me045 | Yeah .
[40:37] fe004 | Um .
"[40:37] me045 | Right , "" this guy I know from school came for dinner "" does not mean , um , "" there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner "" . That 's not the same effect ."
[40:52] me045 | Yeah .
"[40:55] fe004 | um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . So you might imagine that"
[41:01] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:03] fe004 | the information you pass to , you know in identifying a particular referent would be , "" oh , some "" you know , "" it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school "" . So maybe that would ,"
[41:10] me045 | Yeah .
[41:20] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:22] fe004 | you know , so so you could imagine that this might not So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . Um ."
"[41:27] mn015 | But to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . So "" house "" is gender neuter ?"
[41:38] me010 | Semantically .
"[41:40] fe004 | semantically , yeah . Yeah . So it uh , uh , a table ."
"[41:45] fe004 | You know , a thing that c doesn't have a gender . So . Uh , it could be that I mean ,"
"[41:51] fe004 | maybe you 'd maybe not all these I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most most things ."
[42:00] fe004 | Yeah .
"[42:01] fe004 | OK , that is semantic as opposed to Yeah . Yeah . That 's right ."
"[42:11] mn015 | Then "" predications "" makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . Yeah ."
[42:14] fe004 | Open to various things .
[42:18] fe004 | Right .
"[42:19] fe004 | OK , so . Let 's see . So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ?"
[42:31] me045 | Sure .
"[42:32] fe004 | Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . And just a"
"[42:38] fe004 | note , which was that , um s so when we actually ha so for instance , um ,"
"[42:44] fe004 | some of them seem more inherently static , OK , like a container or sort of support - ish ."
"[42:50] fe004 | And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like "" source , path , goal "" is often thought of that way or "" force "" , or something like that ."
"[42:57] fe004 | But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . And different X - schemas use them"
"[43:05] fe004 | in a way that 's either static or dynamic . So "" path "" , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . And you know , "" container "" that you can go in and out . All of these things . And so , um ,"
[43:09] me045 | Mmm .
"[43:14] fe004 | I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day the "" Spaniettes "" , as we called them um ,"
"[43:22] fe004 | to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , X - schematic contributions . How do you link them up . And I think again , um ,"
"[43:30] fe004 | it 's gonna be something in the X - schema that tells you "" is this static or is this dynamic "" . So we definitely need that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . Um ,"
"[43:50] fe004 | Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ?"
[43:52] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:52] fe004 | Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's it 's like I was thinking of type constraints but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema ."
[44:04] me045 | So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .
[44:08] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[44:08] me045 | OK .
"[44:08] fe004 | Um , "" aspectual type "" probably isn't obvious but I should have So , I just neglected to stick something in . "" Perspective "" , "" actor "" , "" undergoer "" , "" observer "" , um ,"
[44:11] me003 | Mmm .
"[44:15] fe004 | I think we 've often used "" agent "" , "" patient "" , obser Yeah , exactly . Exactly . Um , and so one nice thing that , uh ,"
"[44:23] fe004 | we had talked about is this example of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know definitely , it is one way to for you to ,"
"[44:32] fe004 | you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . And so then we talked about , you know , whether"
"[44:44] fe004 | Anyway . So . Sorry . I 'm gonna trail off on that one cuz it 's not that f important right now . Um ,"
"[44:48] me010 | N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were . Yeah ."
"[44:54] fe004 | Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . Um ,"
"[44:57] fe004 | some of these other ones , let 's see . So ,"
"[45:00] fe004 | uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . So polarity , uh , is using for like"
[45:03] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:05] fe004 | action did not take place for instance . So by default it 'll be like "" true "" , I guess , you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen ."
"[45:13] fe004 | You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity , you know , not don't have it here . And then have it part of the speech - act in some way . There 's some negation . But the reason why I left it in is cuz"
[45:20] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:33] me010 | No , I th I think at this lev which is it should be where you have it ."
"[45:37] fe004 | OK , it 's so it 's it 's it 's fine where it is . So , OK ."
[45:44] me010 | by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that .
[45:45] fe004 | Right .
[45:47] fe004 | Right .
"[45:47] me045 | So , I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at . The "" scenario "" box , like , what does that look like for an example ? Like , not all of these things are gonna be here . This is just basically says"
[45:56] fe004 | Yeah .
[45:58] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[45:58] me010 | Correct .
"[46:01] me045 | "" part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas ."
"[46:08] me045 | Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there "" ."
"[46:11] fe004 | So that 's exactly what it is . And for a particular instance which I will , you know , make an example of something , is that you might have an instance of container and path , let 's say , as part of your , you know , "" into """
[46:12] me045 | OK .
[46:22] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[46:24] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:25] fe004 | you know , definition . So you would eventually have instances filled in with various various values for all the different slots . And they 're bound up in , you know , their bindings and and and values ."
[46:30] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[46:33] me045 | OK .
[46:34] me010 | W it c
[46:35] me045 | Do you have to say about the binding in your is there a slot in here for that tells you how the bindings are done ?
"[46:40] me010 | No , no , no . I let 's see , I think we 're we 're not I don't think we have it quite right yet ."
[46:43] me045 | OK .
"[46:43] me010 | So , uh , what this is , let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete ."
[46:48] me045 | OK .
"[46:49] me010 | OK , uh , then this says that when"
"[46:54] me010 | an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context , which is"
[46:56] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:09] me010 | made up entirely of
"[47:12] me010 | these things and , uh , bindings among them ."
[47:16] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:17] me010 | And bindings to ontology items .
[47:19] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:19] me010 | So that that the who that this is the
[47:23] me010 | tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification .
[47:28] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:30] me010 | So that 's A . But B , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also"
[47:31] me045 | OK .
[47:35] me010 | the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions .
[47:41] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:41] me010 | So this is an that anything you have ,"
[47:45] me045 | OK .
"[47:46] me010 | in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes ,"
"[47:50] me010 | from pieces of this ignoring li I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them ."
[47:52] me045 | Right .
[47:58] me045 | OK .
"[47:58] me010 | Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh"
"[48:04] me010 | uh , "" source , path , goal "" has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . Or whate whatever . So those constraints"
[48:07] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[48:09] me045 | Yeah .
[48:12] me010 | appear in constructions but
[48:14] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[48:17] me010 | pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you .
[48:24] me045 | OK .
[48:28] me045 | Yeah .
"[48:29] me010 | OK , good . Let 's let 's mark that . So we need a c"
"[48:32] fe004 | Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . These are all so far these structures , especially from "" path "" and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots ."
[48:46] me010 | Right .
[48:46] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:48] me010 | And and and and this this this again may ge our , um and we and and , of course , worlds ."
"[48:55] fe004 | Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one within , uh within one world . Um ,"
[48:55] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:01] fe004 | even though saying that place takes place , whatever . Uh , if y if I said "" time "" is , you know , "" past "" ,"
"[49:07] fe004 | that would say "" set that this world "" , you know , "" somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time "" ."
[49:08] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[49:09] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[49:11] me045 | Yeah .
[49:11] fe004 | So . But that that that 's sort of OK . The the within the event it 's st it 's still one world .
[49:16] fe004 | Um .
"[49:18] fe004 | Yeah , so "" cause "" and Other frames that could come in I mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , "" desire "" or something like that , like "" want "" ."
[49:25] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:27] fe004 | And actually there is right now under "" discourse segments "" , um , "" attitude "" ? "" Volition "" ? could fill that . So there are a couple things where I like , "" oh , I 'm not sure if"
"[49:38] fe004 | I wanted to have it there or "" Basically there was a whole list of of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed . And , like , well ,"
"[49:45] fe004 | I don't you know , it was like "" hope , wish . desire "" , blah - blah - blah . And it 's like , well ,"
[49:47] me010 | Right .
[49:48] me045 | Uh - huh .
"[49:50] fe004 | I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . So They 're more lexically marked , right ? At least in English ."
[49:56] me045 | Mmm .
"[49:57] fe004 | So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying ,"
"[50:01] fe004 | e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? You know , like"
"[50:04] fe004 | "" Naomi wants wants su a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs "" ."
[50:09] fe004 | u
"[50:13] me010 | Well , and it i basically it 's an action ."
"[50:16] fe004 | Yeah . Situation . Right , right ."
"[50:17] me010 | in in our in our s terminology , "" want "" can be an action and "" what you want "" is a world ."
[50:21] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[50:24] fe004 | Mmm .
"[50:24] me010 | So that 's I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it . Yeah , there there are"
[50:26] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[50:31] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[50:37] me010 | So is this
"[50:39] me010 | comfortable to you that , uh , once we have this defined ,"
[50:44] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[50:45] me010 | it is your tool kit
"[50:47] me010 | for building the semantic part of constructions . And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one ."
[50:55] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[51:02] me045 | Yeah .
"[51:02] me010 | And that 's the wh and and I mean , that according to the party line , that 's the whole story ."
[51:06] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[51:08] me045 | Yeah . Um . y
[51:21] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:22] me045 | is that where you would sa I mean , that 's OK , that 's where the information structure is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um ,"
[51:27] fe004 | Right .
"[51:37] me045 | Hmm . There 's almost I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . So if I say , um ,"
[51:42] fe004 | Yeah .
"[51:47] me045 | You know , "" In France it 's like this "" . You know , great , we 've learned something about France but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about"
[52:00] fe004 | Right .
"[52:07] fe004 | Right , right ."
[52:10] me010 | Right .
"[52:12] fe004 | S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now and to think that there are , um ,"
[52:15] me045 | OK .
"[52:17] fe004 | discourse level constructions in a sense , topic topic - focus constructions that would say , "" oh , when you focus something """
[52:19] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[52:24] me045 | Yeah .
"[52:24] fe004 | then just done the same way just actually in the same way as the lower level . If you stressed , you know , "" John went to the "" , you know , "" the bar "" whatever , you 're focusing that and"
[52:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:32] fe004 | a in a possible inference is "" in contrast to other things "" . So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , "" in France such - and - such happens "" ."
[52:34] me045 | Yeah .
[52:36] me045 | Yeah .
"[52:37] me045 | Yeah , yeah ."
[52:38] fe004 | So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible .
[52:42] me045 | Yeah .
"[52:43] mn015 | Uh , just just , uh , look read uh even sem semi formal Mats Rooth ."
[52:44] fe004 | Yeah .
[52:48] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[52:49] mn015 | If you haven't read it . It 's nice . And just pick any paper on alternative semantics .
[52:51] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[52:54] me045 | OK .
"[52:55] mn015 | So that 's his that 's the best way of talking about focus , is I think his way ."
"[53:01] me045 | OK , what was the name ?"
[53:03] mn015 | Mats . MATS . Rooth .
[53:06] me045 | OK .
"[53:08] mn015 | I think two O 's , yes , TH . I never know how to pronounce his name because he 's sort of ,"
[53:09] me045 | OK .
[53:13] me010 | S Swede ?
"[53:15] mn015 | uh , he is Dutch and , um but very confused background I think ."
"[53:17] me010 | Dutch ? Oh , Dutch ."
[53:18] me045 | Yeah .
[53:22] me010 | Uh - huh .
"[53:23] mn015 | So and , um ,"
[53:25] me045 | Mats Gould .
[53:31] me045 | Hmm .
"[53:33] mn015 | I don't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff ."
[53:36] me045 | OK .
[53:39] me045 | OK .
"[53:41] me045 | OK , thanks ."
[53:46] mn015 | And what I 'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing
[53:52] mn015 | there .
"[53:53] fe004 | So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? So for a particular segment"
[54:02] mn015 | Yeah .
"[54:02] fe004 | the speaker might be you or might be me . Um , hearer is a little bit harder . It could be like multiple people . I guess that that that that 's not very clear from here I mean , that 's not allowed here ."
"[54:11] mn015 | Yeah , but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , because "" you "" , "" me "" , "" he "" , "" they "" , you know , "" these guys "" ,"
[54:25] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[54:30] fe004 | Ye - yeah . So th
[54:36] mn015 | Ah !
"[54:38] fe004 | Right , so the constructions might of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever . In which case they have to check to see ,"
[54:42] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:45] fe004 | uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . But when you actually say that "" he walked into "" , whatever , um ,"
"[54:53] fe004 | the "" he "" will refer to a particular You you will already have figured who "" he "" or "" you "" , mmm , or "" I "" , maybe is a bett better example , who "" I "" refers to ."
"[55:02] fe004 | Um , and then you 'd just be able to refer to Harry , you know , in wherever that person whatever role that person was playing in the event ."
[55:06] mn015 | Mmm .
[55:08] mn015 | That 's up at the reference part .
"[55:09] fe004 | Yeah , yeah ."
[55:10] mn015 | And down there in the speaker - hearer part ?
[55:17] fe004 | n
"[55:17] fe004 | for instance , Speaker is known from the situation , right ? You 're when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is I mean , you know who the speaker is ."
[55:34] me010 | Mmm .
"[55:35] fe004 | I mean , how else would you"
[55:42] fe004 | Yeah .
[55:45] fe004 | Right .
[55:50] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[55:50] mn015 | that happens to be the speaker this time and not "" they , "" whoever they are . Or "" you "" much like the "" you "" could n"
"[55:56] fe004 | S so OK , so I would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to "" I "" . And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to ."
"[56:04] fe004 | So that 's "" I "" but , uh , uh , should we say it it refers to , what ? Uh , if it were "" Harry "" it would refer to like some ontology thing . If it were if it 's "" I "" it would refer to the current speaker ,"
"[56:16] fe004 | OK , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is ."
"[56:18] mn015 | Well , not not always . I mean , so there 's "" and then he said , I w "" Uh - huh ."
"[56:22] fe004 | "" I "" within the current world ."
[56:24] mn015 | Yeah .
"[56:24] me010 | Yeah . That 's right . So so again , this uh , this this is gonna to get us into the mental space stuff and t because"
"[56:24] fe004 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[56:28] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[56:28] me045 | Mmm .
"[56:30] me010 | you know , "" Fred said that Mary said "" , and whatever . And and so we 're , uh"
"[56:34] me010 | gonna have to , um , chain those as well ."
[56:39] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[56:40] fe004 | So this entire thing
[56:43] me010 | Right .
"[56:44] fe004 | is inside a world , not just like the top part ."
[56:47] me010 | Right .
[56:51] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:02] me010 | So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , and this is where blends and all terribl So , some things which really are meant to be"
[57:05] fe004 | Yeah .
[57:08] fe004 | Yeah .
"[57:12] me010 | identified and some things which aren't . And again , all we need for the moment is some way to"
[57:13] fe004 | Right .
[57:16] fe004 | Right .
[57:19] me010 | say that .
[57:28] me010 | You could do that .
[57:32] fe004 | it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing . If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever .
[57:36] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:40] fe004 | If it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ? Or something in ontology . So ,"
[57:45] me010 | uh - huh .
"[57:48] fe004 | there 's a you know , whatever , it c it could point at one of these ."
[57:49] me010 | I just had a I just had an an idea that would be very nice if it works .
[57:53] fe004 | For what ? If it works .
"[57:53] me010 | Uh , uh , uh , I haven't told you what it is yet . This was my"
[57:55] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Mmm .
[57:57] me010 | build - up . An i an idea that would be nice i
[57:58] fe004 | Yeah .
"[57:59] fe004 | OK , we 're crossing our fingers ."
[58:00] me010 | Right . If it worked .
"[58:01] me003 | So we 're building a mental space , good ."
[58:02] me010 | Yeah .
"[58:03] me010 | Right , it was a space builder ."
"[58:05] me010 | Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces"
"[58:14] me010 | because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . And so , i"
[58:14] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[58:23] fe004 | Yep .
"[58:25] me010 | it c it it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure ."
[58:28] fe004 | Use the same Yep .
[58:32] me010 | So that pulling something out of a discourse context is
"[58:40] me010 | I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . Uh , I 've I 've I 've never seen anybody"
[58:40] me003 | I see .
[58:41] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[58:47] me010 | write that up but maybe they did . I don't know . That may be all over the literature .
[58:49] fe004 | Yeah .
"[59:02] me045 | um , you know , you say something like or or I was thinking you can say something like , "" oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican "" or something like that . Where as in English you would say , "" I thought you were "" . Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb"
[59:12] me010 | Right .
"[59:16] me045 | doesn't happen there , so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah . Same things happens with pronouns . There 's languages where , um ,"
[59:21] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[59:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[59:28] me045 | if you have a verb of saying then ,"
"[59:32] me045 | where OK , so a situation like "" Bob said he was going to the movies "" , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have "" I "" there ."
[59:39] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[59:45] me045 | Yeah .
[59:45] fe004 | Right .
[59:45] me003 | Right .
"[59:45] me045 | But it 's not perceived as a quotative construction . I mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun ,"
[59:48] me010 | Yeah .
"[59:53] me045 | um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing , right ? Um ,"
"[59:57] fe004 | Oh , right . Yeah , that makes sense ."
[59:58] me010 | OK .
"[59:59] me045 | but uh , that happens to sound like the word for "" I "" but is actually semantically unrelated to it ."
"[00:06] me045 | Um ,"
[00:06] fe004 | Really ?
[00:06] me045 | Yeah . Yeah .
[00:08] fe004 | You 're kidding .
"[00:09] me045 | There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . Uh , Mary Dalrymple , uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh"
"[00:14] fe004 | No , that 's horrible ."
[00:16] me045 | on pronoun stuff .
[00:18] fe004 | That 's horrible . OK .
"[00:19] me045 | Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL where , you know , you 're signing and someone says something . And then , you know , so "" he say "" , and then you sort of do a role shift . And then you sign "" I , this , that , and the other "" . And you know , "" I did this "" ."
[00:28] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[00:31] me045 | That 's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with "" I "" . And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on . So ,"
[00:38] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[00:45] fe004 | Yeah .
"[00:46] me010 | So that that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah ."
[00:47] me045 | Right . Yeah .
"[00:50] fe004 | OK , so it 's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context . And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever ,"
[00:58] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[00:58] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:00] fe004 | um , you you you 're scope is m might extend out to the the base one ."
[01:02] me045 | Yeah .
"[01:05] fe004 | It would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it 'll be one or the other . It 's like , oh , actually , it 's the same same operation . So ."
[01:11] me045 | Yeah .
"[01:13] me010 | Oh , OK , so this this is worth some thought ."
"[01:14] me045 | It 's like it 's like what 's happening that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ? So that 's that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . And so ,"
"[01:19] fe004 | Yeah , yeah ."
[01:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[01:25] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:26] me045 | um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space which can change . And we need all the same machinery ."
"[01:32] fe004 | Mm - hmm , right ."
[01:34] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[01:36] fe004 | Robert .
"[01:37] me010 | Well , but , uh , this is very good actually cuz it it it to the extent that it works , it y"
[01:38] me045 | Schade .
[01:42] fe004 | Ties it all into it . Yeah .
[01:43] me010 | it it ties together several of of these things .
[01:44] fe004 | Yep .
"[01:55] fe004 | Oh , yeah ."
[01:56] me045 | Yeah .
"[01:58] fe004 | Yeah , that 's why I said "" point to Robert "" , when I did it ."
[01:58] me003 | Well every time Nancy giggles it means it means that it 's your job .
[02:13] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:15] mn015 | d doesn't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , that whenever I say something I could preface that with "" I think . """
[02:23] me045 | Yeah .
[02:24] mn015 | Nuh ?
[02:25] mn015 | So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue .
[02:29] me045 | Yeah .
"[02:32] me010 | No , but there 's there 's a Gricean thing going on there , that when you say "" I think "" you 're actually hedging ."
[02:38] fe004 | Mmm .
[02:40] me045 | Yeah . Y
[02:40] me010 | Right .
"[02:43] mn015 | Yeah , it 's Absolutely ."
"[02:44] me045 | Yeah , it 's an it 's an evidential . It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . People have talked about it this way . And you know , you can do sort of special things . You can , th"
"[02:56] fe004 | Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it 's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that . So ."
[02:56] mn015 | Yeah .
[03:05] me045 | Yeah .
"[03:07] mn015 | Yeah , but about linguistic hedges , I mean , those those tend to be ,"
[03:14] me010 | So we don't have that in here either do we ?
[03:15] me045 | Yeah .
[03:16] fe004 | Hedges ?
"[03:17] me010 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[03:18] fe004 | Hhh , I there used to be a slot for speaker , um ,"
"[03:23] fe004 | it was something like factivity . I couldn't really remember what it meant so I took it out . But it 's something we we were talking about sarcasm too , right ?"
[03:25] me045 | Yeah . Um .
"[03:26] me045 | Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? I mean ,"
"[03:29] fe004 | Oh , oh . Oh , yeah , yeah , right ."
[03:34] me010 | So we probably should .
[03:36] fe004 | Yeah .
[03:37] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[03:39] me010 | Confidence or something like that .
[03:47] fe004 | Yeah .
"[03:48] mn015 | Uh great word in the English language is called "" about "" ."
"[03:51] mn015 | If you study how people use that it 's also "" about . """
[03:53] fe004 | What 's the word ?
[03:55] me010 | About .
"[03:57] me010 | Oh , that in that use of "" about "" , yeah ."
[03:57] mn015 | clever .
"[03:57] fe004 | Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge ."
[03:58] me045 | Yeah .
[04:00] me010 | And I think And I think y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that .
[04:10] me010 | Yeah .
[04:12] me045 | Yeah .
[04:14] me010 | Yeah .
[04:18] fe004 | What ?
[04:21] me045 | Ask me about it later I 'll tell you how .
[04:30] fe004 | I 'd love to know .
"[04:31] me003 | Oh , man ."
"[04:32] fe004 | So , and and I think , uh , someone had raised like sarcasm as a"
[04:36] fe004 | complication at some point . And
[04:39] fe004 | we just won't deal with sarcastic people .
"[04:49] me045 | hhh , I don't know , m"
"[04:50] fe004 | Certainly not as some Well , they 're intonational markers I think for the most part . I don't"
[04:53] me045 | Yeah .
"[04:58] me045 | There 's lots of different attitudes that that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . But like"
[05:02] fe004 | Yeah .
[05:05] me045 | what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ?
[05:07] me010 | Right .
"[05:09] me010 | Right , so , uh , this this raises the question of what are our current purposes ."
[05:09] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[05:13] me010 | Right ?
[05:16] mn015 | Mmm .
[05:17] mn015 | Yeah .
"[05:17] me010 | Uh , so , um ,"
"[05:20] me010 | I I don't know the answer but but , um , it does seem that ,"
"[05:26] me010 | you know , this is this is coming along . I think it 's it 's converging . It 's as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental the whole s mental space thing ."
[05:34] me010 | And then there 's some other minor things .
[05:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:37] me010 | Um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . I mean , if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know , w we 'll go nuts ."
[05:42] me045 | Yeah .
[05:43] me010 | So we had started with the idea that
"[05:47] me010 | the actual , uh , constraint was"
[05:55] me010 | related to this tourist domain
"[05:57] me010 | and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain ,"
"[06:01] me010 | assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to d you know , there 's all sorts of God knows , irony , and stuff like which you isn't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide ."
[06:08] me045 | Yeah .
[06:12] me010 | Yeah ?
[06:13] me010 | Uh .
[06:13] fe004 | M mockery .
[06:14] me010 | Right . Whatever . So
[06:21] me010 | Go ahead .
[06:31] me045 | Yeah .
[06:32] me010 | N no . No .
[06:34] me045 | Right .
[06:36] me010 | No .
[06:40] me010 | Right .
"[06:40] me045 | We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now . Yeah , right , I mean ."
"[06:43] me010 | Right . No , no . Anyway , so so , um , I guess"
"[06:50] me010 | uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , which is that , um ,"
"[07:00] me010 | it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that"
"[07:13] me010 | you , over the next couple weeks , n don't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . Uh , and then when Robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them ."
[07:17] me045 | Mmm .
[07:25] me045 | OK .
[07:31] me045 | OK .
"[07:32] me010 | Just just sort of , you know , define your space ."
"[07:34] me045 | Yeah , OK ."
"[07:35] me010 | And , um , so th these are this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with ."
[07:41] me045 | Yeah .
[07:42] me010 | And then we 'll we 'll we 'll go back over it and w people will will give feedback on it . And then then we 'll have a at least initial
[07:45] me045 | OK .
[07:54] me010 | spec of of what we 're actually trying to do . And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser .
[07:56] me045 | Yeah .
"[08:06] me010 | "" who might want "" et cetera . So ,"
[08:07] me045 | OK .
"[08:09] me010 | So a and we get this this , uh , portals fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . And then of course Nancy you 're gonna have to , uh , do your set of but you have to do that anyway ."
"[08:26] fe004 | For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm ."
"[08:27] me010 | So so we 're gonna get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and the and the child language learning . And we 'll see what we need for"
[08:32] me003 | Mmm .
"[08:37] me010 | those two . And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've we really want to get done ."
[08:51] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[08:56] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:57] me010 | And then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and and all that ."
[09:02] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:09] me010 | Uh , without doubt ."
[09:10] fe004 | Yeah .
[09:10] me010 | Yeah . But what I want to do is is is to to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for .
[09:11] mn015 | even suggest some solutions . Yeah .
[09:17] mn015 | Mmm .
[09:18] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[09:18] me010 | So that that we say these are the things we 're really gonna try do by the end of the summer
"[09:22] me010 | and other things we 'll put on a list of of research problems or something , because"
"[09:28] me010 | you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something you say , "" oh , yeah , but what about this case ? """
[09:37] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[09:37] me010 | This is this is called being a linguist .
[09:39] mn015 | Mmm .
"[09:42] me010 | And , uh ,"
[09:43] me045 | Basically .
[09:44] me010 | Huh ?
[09:55] fe004 | Yeah .
[09:57] me010 | Right .
"[10:00] fe004 | Sure , yeah ."
[10:02] me010 | a general way to proceed ?
"[10:02] me045 | Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , just figuring out what needs to be done then actually"
[10:08] me045 | the next step is to start trying to do it . Got it .
[10:10] me010 | Exactly right .
[10:11] mn015 | Mmm .
[10:13] mn015 | Mmm .
[10:13] me045 | OK .
[10:18] me045 | You ran out of power .
[10:19] mn015 | Huh ?
[10:20] me003 | Can I ask a quick question about this side ?
[10:21] fe004 | Yes .
[10:22] mn015 | Yeah .
"[10:28] fe004 | Um ,"
"[10:30] fe004 | not really just on the constructions , right ?"
"[10:32] me003 | Yeah , like constructions can inherit from other things , am I right ? Yeah ."
"[10:33] fe004 | Um ,"
[10:35] fe004 | yeah .
[10:37] fe004 | I didn't want to think too much about that for for now .
[10:39] me003 | OK .
"[10:40] fe004 | So , uh , maybe it was subconsciously intentional ."
[10:40] me010 | Yeah .
"[10:42] me010 | Yeah , uh yeah ."
"[10:42] me045 | Um , yeah , there should be I I wanted to s find out someday if there was gonna be some way of dealing with ,"
"[10:50] me045 | uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , where one construction is inheriting from , uh"
[10:53] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[10:53] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[10:56] fe004 | Yep .
[10:59] fe004 | Yeah .
"[11:03] me045 | which of you know , which are how they 're getting bound together ."
"[11:04] me010 | Yeah , right , right , right ."
"[11:05] fe004 | Yeah , and and there are certainly cases like that . Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples . So ,"
"[11:05] me010 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[11:10] me010 | Right .
[11:11] fe004 | and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway .
[11:12] me010 | Yeah . So what I would like to do is separate that problem out . So
[11:15] fe004 | Inherits .
[11:16] me045 | OK .
"[11:17] me010 | um , my argument is there 's"
[11:21] me010 | nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more
"[11:26] me045 | Yeah , yes ."
"[11:27] me010 | constructions . It 's uglier and it d doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff . Uh ,"
[11:28] me045 | That 's right .
[11:32] me010 | Right .
[11:34] me010 | And so I what I 'd like to do is is in the short run focus on
"[11:39] me010 | getting it right . And when we think we have it right then saying , "" aha ! , can we make it more elegant ? """
[11:40] me045 | Yeah .
[11:45] me045 | Yeah .
"[11:45] me010 | Can can we , uh What are the generalizations , and stuff ? But rather than try to guess"
[11:46] me045 | Connect the dots . Yeah .
[11:52] me010 | a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . So I would say in the short run
[11:52] me045 | Yep .
[11:54] me045 | Yeah .
[11:56] me045 | Yeah .
[11:58] me010 | we 're not gonna b
"[11:59] me010 | First of all , we 're not doing them yet at all ."
"[12:02] me010 | And and it could be that half way through we say , "" aha ! , we we now see how we want to clean it up . """
[12:08] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:09] me010 | Uh , and inheritance is only one I mean , that 's one way to organize it but there are others . And it may or may not be the best way ."
[12:16] me045 | Yeah .
"[12:20] me010 | I 'm sorry , you had news ."
[12:20] mn015 | Mmm .
"[12:21] mn015 | Oh , just small stuff . Um ,"
"[12:24] mn015 | thanks to Eva on our web site we can now ,"
"[12:27] mn015 | if you want to run JavaBayes , uh , you could see get download these classes ."
[12:34] mn015 | And then it will enable you she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format . So that 's wonderful .
[12:40] fn050 | Mm - hmm .
[12:43] me003 | Mmm .
[12:47] me010 | Great .
"[12:53] fn050 | I was just checking like , when we wanna , um ,"
"[13:00] fn050 | You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? You can't . You have to make separate queries every time ."
[13:05] mn015 | Uh - huh .
"[13:07] mn015 | OK , that 's that 's a bit unfortunate but"
[13:09] fn050 | Yeah .
"[13:13] fn050 | You just have to have a long list of , you know , all the variables . Basically ."
[13:15] mn015 | Yeah .
"[13:16] fe004 | Uh , all the things you want to query , you just have to like ask for separately ."
"[13:18] fn050 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[13:20] mn015 | Well that 's probably maybe in the long term that 's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an out output . Um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time ."
"[13:34] mn015 | And , um , I don't know . We 're really running late , so I had , uh , an idea"
"[13:44] mn015 | yesterday but , uh , I don't know whether we should even start discussing ."
"[13:48] me010 | W what Yeah , sure , tell us what it is ."
"[13:50] mn015 | Um ,"
"[13:53] mn015 | the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but hasn't been , um , made precise by any means , um ,"
[14:26] fe004 | Bayes ?
"[14:27] mn015 | Bayes - net , um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . So you have nothing ."
[14:28] fe004 | OK .
[14:36] mn015 | Just a white piece of paper .
"[14:36] me010 | Mmm , right ."
[14:44] fe004 | Grout out the things that that you need .
[14:47] me010 | Right .
"[14:47] mn015 | then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper . And"
"[15:02] mn015 | that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse"
"[15:09] mn015 | but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model ."
[15:14] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:17] mn015 | And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the the net that you just wrote"
[15:25] mn015 | and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance
"[15:36] mn015 | we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away ."
[15:43] mn015 | And the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it .
"[15:48] mn015 | You may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what , so that will allow you"
[15:54] mn015 | to craft the the the initial notes . But it 's in that respect it 's completely scalable .
"[16:00] mn015 | Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent"
[16:11] mn015 | modules . And if this can be made to work
"[16:14] mn015 | at all , that 'd be kind of funky ."
"[16:17] me010 | Um , it sounds to me like you want P R Ms ."
"[16:27] me010 | No , no , you can't . See the the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated"
[16:39] me010 | the PRM with the instances and ther then you can then you can unfold it .
[16:41] mn015 | Then you can .
"[16:43] mn015 | Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So ,"
"[16:52] me010 | Well , no , but it matters a lot because you what you want are these generalized rules"
"[16:59] me010 | about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case ."
[17:01] mn015 | And then then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the the way the only way it works . @ @
"[17:06] me010 | Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I we have a our local expert on P R Ms , uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll we 'll have to see ."
"[17:18] mn015 | But , uh ,"
[17:22] me010 | Yes . This is that 's that would be a good thing to try .
[17:26] me010 | It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story
[17:39] mn015 | Except there 's no no theorem prover involved .
[17:39] fe004 | Best explanation .
"[17:42] me010 | No , there isn't a theorem prover but there but but the , um ,"
"[17:47] me010 | The cove the the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're you 're coupling a bunch of them together . And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely ."
"[17:55] mn015 | Mm - hmm , yeah ."
[18:05] me010 | Tricky .
"[18:06] me010 | But you yeah , it 's a good it 's a it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal ."
[18:10] mn015 | What 's it ?
[18:13] me010 | So are you gonna write something for us before you go ?
[18:15] mn015 | Yes . Um .
"[18:16] me010 | Oh , you have something ."
"[18:19] mn015 | In the process thereof , or whatever ."
[18:20] me010 | OK .
"[18:20] me010 | So , what 's what when are we gonna meet again ?"
"[18:24] fe004 | When are you leaving ? Thursday , Friday ?"
[18:26] fn050 | Fri -
[18:28] fe004 | OK .
[18:28] me010 | Yeah .
"[18:31] mn015 | I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?"
"[18:36] me010 | N no , I didn't mean y just the two of us . We obviously we can we can do this . But the question is do you want to ,"
[18:52] mn015 | We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah .
[18:57] me045 | Fine with me .
[19:01] me045 | Should we do the one PM time
[19:06] mn015 | Sure .
[19:06] me045 | OK .
[19:08] me010 | Alright .
[19:09] fn050 | Hmm .
"[19:09] mn015 | Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work ."
[19:21] mn015 | And we can make some last minute changes on that .
[19:26] me003 | You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper .
[19:33] fe004 | Can we do can we do one - thirty ?
[19:33] me010 | Alright .
[19:35] mn015 | No .
"[19:36] fe004 | Oh , you already told me no . One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine ."
[19:37] mn015 | But we can do four .
[19:42] fe004 | It 's fine .
[19:44] mn015 | One or four . I don't care .
[19:48] mn015 | If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ?
"[19:50] fe004 | Yeah , it 's fine . Fine . Yeah no , no , no , uh , I don't care . It 's fine ."
[19:50] mn015 | Four ?
"[19:54] mn015 | It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four ."
[19:58] me003 | The pressure 's on you Nancy .
"[19:59] mn015 | Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know the discussions short ."
[20:05] fe004 | OK .
"[20:06] fe004 | OK , four ."
[20:08] fe004 | OK ? OK . I am .
"[20:08] me045 | Well , if you insist , then ."

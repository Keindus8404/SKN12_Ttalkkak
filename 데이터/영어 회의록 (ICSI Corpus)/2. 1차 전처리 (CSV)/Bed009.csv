[00:01] me012 | Hmm . Testing channel two .
[00:06] me012 | Two .
[00:09] mn047 | Hello ?
[00:22] mn015 | Hmm ?
[00:23] mn015 | Yeah
[00:24] mn015 | Thank You .
[00:31] mn015 | OK
[00:32] me010 | OK .
"[00:33] mn015 | Well , so"
[00:35] mn015 | Ralf and Tilman are here .
[00:36] me010 | Great .
[00:37] me010 | Great .
[00:38] mn015 | Made it safely .
[00:39] me010 | So the what w we
[00:41] me010 | h have been doing i they would like us all to read these digits .
[00:45] me010 | But we don't all read them but a couple people read them .
[00:48] mn048 | OK .
[00:50] mn015 | Sure .
[00:51] me010 | OK .
[00:53] mn015 | OK and the way you do it is you just read the numbers
[00:56] mn015 | not as
"[00:58] mn015 | uh each single , so just like I do it ."
[01:00] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[01:00] mn015 | OK .
[01:01] mn015 | First you read the transcript number .
[01:46] mn015 | Turn .
[03:34] me010 | OK . Let 's be done with this .
"[03:36] me010 | OK . this is Ami , who And this is Tilman and Ralf ."
[03:38] mn048 | Hi . Uh - huh .
[03:39] mn047 | Hi .
[03:39] me010 | Hi .
"[03:41] me010 | OK . So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk ,"
[03:46] me010 | uh downstairs .
[03:47] mn048 | Hmm .
"[03:49] me010 | And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times , right ? That 's great ."
[03:53] mn048 | Yes .
[03:53] mn047 | Mmm .
"[03:55] me010 | OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?"
[03:58] mn015 | I thought
[03:58] mn015 | two things uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do .
"[04:02] mn015 | And um we already talked with Andreas ,"
[04:06] mn015 | Thilo and
[04:07] mn015 | David and
[04:08] mn015 | some lines of code were already written today
[04:11] mn015 | and almost tested
[04:14] mn015 | and
[04:14] mn015 | just gonna
[04:15] mn015 | say we have um again the recognizer
[04:17] mn015 | to parser
[04:19] mn015 | thing where we 're working on and that should be no problem
[04:23] mn015 | and then
[04:25] mn015 | that can be sort of developed uh
[04:28] mn015 | as needed when we get enter the tourism domain .
[04:32] mn015 | em we have talked this morning with the with Tilman about the generator .
[04:37] mn015 | and um
[04:37] mn048 | S
[04:39] mn015 | There one of our
[04:40] mn015 | diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to
[04:44] mn015 | look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English
[04:49] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[04:49] mn015 | because
[04:51] mn015 | w we have we face
[04:52] mn015 | two ways . Either we do a syllable concatenating
[04:55] mn015 | um
[04:56] mn015 | grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and
"[05:00] mn015 | doing it the easy way ,"
[05:01] mn015 | or we simply adopt the ah um
[05:05] mn015 | more in - depth
[05:06] mn015 | um style that is implemented in the German system
[05:09] mn015 | and um
[05:12] mn015 | are then able not only to produce
[05:13] mn015 | strings but also the syntactic parse
[05:16] mn015 | uh not parse not
[05:17] mn015 | the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure
"[05:20] mn015 | which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning"
[05:23] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[05:25] mn015 | and um it does require some some knowledge of of those grammars and and and
[05:31] mn015 | some ling linguistic background .
[05:33] mn015 | But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone .
[05:37] me010 | OK So
"[05:39] me010 | That sounds good . Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ?"
[05:44] me003 | Sure .
[05:45] me010 | cuz
[05:46] me010 | y you 're
[05:47] me010 | the grammar maven .
"[05:51] me010 | I mean it makes sense , doesn't it ?"
[05:52] me003 | Yeah .
[05:52] me010 | Yeah
[05:53] me010 | Good .
[05:57] me010 | the right way to do that .
[05:59] me010 | And
"[06:01] me010 | an Yeah , so I I actually wanna f"
"[06:02] me010 | to find out about it too , but"
[06:04] me010 | I may not have time to
[06:06] mn015 | the the ultimate goal is that before
[06:06] me010 | get in .
[06:09] mn015 | they leave we we can run through the entire system
[06:12] mn015 | input through output on at least one or two sample
[06:16] mn015 | things .
[06:17] mn015 | And um
[06:19] mn015 | and by virtue of doing that
[06:22] mn015 | then in this case Johno will have acquired the knowledge of how to extend it .
[06:25] mn015 | Ad infinitum .
"[06:28] mn015 | When needed , if needed , when wanted"
[06:31] mn015 | and so forth .
[06:36] me010 | OK that sounds great .
[06:37] mn015 | And um
[06:40] mn015 | also um
[06:42] mn015 | Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna
[06:45] mn015 | continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever
[06:47] mn047 | Mmm .
[06:48] mn015 | to get the er parser interface working .
[06:52] mn015 | They are thinning out and thickening out lattices and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best .
"[06:56] mn047 | Mmm , yep ."
[06:58] me010 | Great .
"[07:02] mn048 | Yes , very much so ."
[07:06] me010 | Great .
[07:11] me010 | Sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on .
"[07:17] me010 | Also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code ."
[07:23] mn048 | Yes .
[07:23] me010 | and
[07:24] me010 | we can d I dunno w w was there
[07:27] me010 | uh a time when we were set up to do that ?
"[07:30] me010 | It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand"
[07:33] mn048 | Yes .
[07:34] mn047 | Hmm .
[07:35] mn048 | Yeah .
[07:36] me010 | uh better what 's going on .
[07:37] me010 | So when do you guys leave ?
[07:39] mn047 | Oh
[07:41] mn048 | All through Friday would be fine .
[07:43] me010 | so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about your understanding of what SmartKom plans are .
[07:52] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[07:54] me010 | and how we can change them .
[07:56] mn048 | Yes . Sure .
"[07:57] me010 | Uh ,"
[07:59] mn015 | Should we already set a date for that ?
[08:00] mn015 | Might be beneficial while we 're all here .
[08:03] me010 | OK ?
"[08:20] me010 | What what does not work for me is Thursday afternoon . I can do earlier in the day on Thursday ,"
"[08:26] me010 | or um most of the time on Friday , not all ."
[08:32] mn015 | Thursday morning sounds fine ?
"[08:33] me010 | Wha - but , Johno ,"
[08:34] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[08:34] me010 | what are your constraints ?
[08:36] me003 | um
[08:45] me003 | Uh
[08:49] me003 | Thursday morning should be fine .
[08:55] me010 | Eleven ?
[08:55] mn048 | OK .
[08:58] me010 | Eleven on Thursday ?
[09:00] me010 | @ @
[09:00] me003 | I was just thinking I w I will have leavened by
[09:03] me010 | Right .
[09:04] me003 | eleven .
[09:04] me010 | Right . This is then out of deference to our
[09:07] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[09:07] me010 | non - morning people .
[09:18] mn048 | So at eleven ?
[09:19] mn047 | Hmm .
[09:20] mn048 | Thursday around eleven ?
[09:21] me010 | Yeah .
[09:33] me010 | And actually we can invite um
[09:35] me010 | Andreas as well .
"[09:37] mn015 | Uh he will be in Washington , though ."
[09:38] me010 | Oh that 's true . He 's off off on his trip already .
[09:43] mn015 | but um
[09:45] mn015 | David is here and
[09:47] me010 | Thilo .
[09:47] mn015 | he 's actually
[09:50] mn015 | knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .
[09:51] me010 | OK well yeah maybe we 'll see if David could make it . That would be good .
[10:01] mn015 | OK so
[10:03] mn015 | facing to to what we 've sort of been doing here
[10:07] mn015 | um
[10:09] mn015 | well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .
[10:12] mn015 | um
[10:13] mn015 | um
"[10:14] mn015 | Not this type of data , no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such"
"[10:16] mn048 | Oh , OK ."
[10:21] mn015 | not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it .
[10:24] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[10:25] mn015 | The major difference to the Munich ones is that
[10:28] mn015 | we do it via the telephone
[10:31] mn048 | OK .
[10:31] mn015 | even though all the recording is done here
[10:33] mn015 | and so it 's a sort of a computer call system
[10:37] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[10:37] mn015 | that gives you tourist information tells you how to get places .
[10:40] mn015 | And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on .
[10:44] mn015 | and
[10:45] mn015 | part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .
[10:52] mn048 | Yeah .
[10:55] mn015 | and
[10:56] mn015 | we 're setting it up so that we can we hope to implant certain intentions in people .
[11:01] mn015 | For example
[11:02] mn015 | um
[11:05] mn015 | we have first looked at a simple sentence that
"[11:09] mn015 | "" How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? """
[11:11] mn015 | OK so you have the castle of Heidelberg
[11:12] mn048 | OK .
[11:13] mn015 | and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower .
"[11:13] mn048 | Oh , OK . Yeah ."
[11:16] mn015 | and um
[11:17] mn015 | so
[11:19] mn015 | What will you parse out of that sentence ?
"[11:21] mn015 | Probably something that we specified in M - three - L , that is"
[11:23] mn047 | Mmm .
"[11:26] mn015 | "" action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower "" ."
"[11:31] mn015 | And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment ."
[11:37] mn015 | And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project and we noticed that
[11:43] mn015 | first of all what are I should 've
"[11:45] mn015 | brought some slides , but"
[11:48] mn015 | what our So here 's the tower .
[11:52] mn015 | Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower .
[11:55] mn015 | And our system led people
"[11:56] mn015 | here , to a point where they were facing a wall"
"[12:00] mn015 | in front of the tower . There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest"
[12:03] mn015 | point of the road network to the geometric center
[12:06] mn015 | Because that 's how the algorithm works .
[12:09] mn015 | So we took out that part of the road network as a hack and then it found actually the way to the entrance .
[12:15] mn015 | which was now the closest point of the road network to
"[12:18] mn015 | OK , geometric center ."
"[12:19] mn015 | But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter , because it 's not really interesting ."
[12:25] mn015 | They wanna go
[12:26] mn015 | to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture .
"[12:30] mn048 | Oh , OK . Yeah ."
[12:30] mn047 | Hmm .
[12:31] mn015 | And so what uh uh a s you s
[12:36] mn015 | let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance
[12:38] mn015 | won't really give us is what the person actually wants .
[12:42] mn015 | Does he wanna go there to see it ? Does he wanna go there now ? Later ?
[12:47] mn015 | How does the person wanna go there ? Is that
[12:49] mn015 | person more likely to want to walk there ?
[12:52] mn015 | Walk a scenic route ?
[12:53] mn015 | and so forth . There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified
[12:57] mn015 | in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things .
[13:02] mn015 | And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the
[13:06] mn015 | extra - linguistic parameters that may f
[13:08] mn015 | play a role . Information related to the user and information related to the situation .
[13:14] mn015 | And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that
[13:19] mn015 | what we can get from the utterance . That 's part of why we implant
[13:22] mn015 | these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually
[13:25] mn015 | phrase things differently whether
[13:27] mn015 | they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it .
[13:33] mn015 | And um
[13:34] mn015 | so the idea is to construct uh um
[13:38] mn015 | suitable interfaces and a belief - net for
[13:41] mn015 | a module that actually tries to guess what
[13:45] mn015 | the underlying intention was .
[13:47] mn015 | And then
[13:49] mn015 | enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought
[13:54] mn015 | what more it sort of
[13:56] mn015 | got out of that utterance .
"[13:57] mn015 | So if it can make a good suggestion , "" Hey ! """
"[14:00] mn015 | you know , "" that person doesn't wanna enter . That person just wants to take a picture , """
"[14:04] mn015 | cuz he just bought film , or "" that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before "" ."
"[14:09] mn015 | Or "" that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something and that you usually do inside of buildings "" and so forth ."
[14:15] mn015 | These ah these types of uh
[14:19] mn015 | these bits of additional information are going to be
[14:22] mn015 | embedded into the M - three - L structure
[14:24] mn015 | in an sort of subfield that we have reserved .
"[14:28] mn015 | And if the action planner does something with it , great . If not"
"[14:33] mn015 | you know , then that 's also something"
[14:39] mn015 | at least we want to offer the
[14:41] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[14:42] mn047 | Hmm .
[14:43] mn015 | um
"[14:46] mn015 | t s Ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s"
[14:50] mn015 | do something with it sooner or later . That 's sort of part of our belief .
"[14:54] mn015 | Um , for example ,"
[14:56] mn015 | right now I know the GIS from email
[14:59] mn015 | is not able to calculate these viewpoints .
[15:02] mn015 | So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet
[15:04] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:05] mn015 | to do that dynamically , but if we can offer it"
"[15:08] mn015 | that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it ."
"[15:12] mn015 | Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used , so ."
"[15:18] mn015 | What have I forgotten about ? Oh yeah , how we do it , yeah that 's the"
[15:19] me010 | Well th uh
[15:21] me010 | No no . It 's a good time to pause . I s I
"[15:30] mn048 | Well the obvious one would be if if you envision this as a module within SmartKom , where exactly would that"
[15:36] mn048 | Sit ?
[15:37] mn015 | um so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module . So this is one that already adds
[15:37] mn048 | That 's the d
[15:42] mn047 | Hmm .
"[15:43] mn048 | OK , yeah ."
[15:44] mn048 | Makes perfect sense .
[15:46] mn048 | Yes .
"[15:46] mn047 | Hmm , ah ."
[15:46] mn015 | additional information to the
[15:48] mn015 | but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition
[15:51] mn015 | I mean basically this is what attention - recognition literally sort of
[15:55] mn048 | Well it 's supposed to do .
[15:56] mn048 | Yeah
"[15:56] me010 | That 's what it should do . Right , yeah ."
[15:57] mn048 | Yeah . Yeah .
[15:58] mn047 | Huh .
[15:58] mn015 | Yeah .
[16:00] mn048 | Well f from my understanding of what the people at Phillips
[16:03] mn048 | were originally trying to do
[16:05] mn048 | doesn't seem to quite fit into SmartKom currently
[16:09] mn048 | so what they 're really doing
[16:10] mn048 | right now is only selecting among
"[16:13] mn048 | the alternatives , the hypotheses that they 're given"
[16:15] mn048 | enriched by the domain knowledge and
[16:15] mn015 | Yeah .
[16:18] mn048 | the um discourse modeler and so on .
[16:20] mn015 | Yeah .
[16:20] mn048 | So if if this is additional information that
[16:22] mn048 | could be merged in by them .
[16:25] mn048 | And then it would be available to action planning and and others .
[16:27] mn015 | Yeah .
[16:36] me010 | let 's let 's
[16:37] me010 | That w OK that was one question . Is there other other things that
[16:41] me010 | cuz we wanna
[16:42] me010 | not
"[16:44] me010 | Pa - pass over any you know , questions or concerns that you have ."
[16:54] mn048 | Well there 're there 're
[16:54] mn048 | two levels of of giving an answer and I guess on both levels I don't have any
[16:58] mn048 | um
[16:58] mn047 | Mmm .
[16:58] mn048 | further questions .
[17:00] mn048 | uh the the two levels will be
[17:00] mn047 | Mmm .
[17:03] mn048 | uh standing here for the generation module and the other is is
[17:06] mn048 | my understanding of what SmartKom uh is supposed to be
[17:08] me010 | Right .
[17:10] mn048 | and I I think that fits in perfectly
[17:11] mn047 | Hmm .
[17:12] me010 | Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation .
[17:14] mn048 | Yeah .
[17:16] me010 | So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig um
[17:23] me010 | a
[17:25] me010 | belief - net
"[17:29] me010 | There 's a first cut at a belief - net that that doesn't it isn't fully uh instantiated , and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities aren't there ."
[17:39] me010 | But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space and the things that influence them .
[17:45] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[17:47] me010 | So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .
[17:50] me010 | Do you want to
"[17:52] me010 | um access , view or enter"
[17:56] me010 | a thing .
[17:57] mn047 | Hmm .
"[17:58] me010 | So that 's a a discrete decision . There are only three possibilities and the uh what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to"
[17:58] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[18:08] me010 | add
[18:10] me010 | which of those it is and give it to the planner .
[18:12] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:15] me010 | But ,"
[18:16] me010 | uh th the current design suggests that
[18:19] me010 | if
[18:21] me010 | it seems to be an important
[18:23] me010 | decision
[18:24] me010 | and if the belief - net is equivocal
"[18:27] me010 | so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask"
[18:34] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[18:35] me010 | for the information you want .
[18:37] me010 | Alright ? Now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that .
[18:41] me010 | For the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu and the while you 're debugging you will just OK .
"[18:46] me010 | But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query ,"
"[18:53] me010 | give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know"
[18:53] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[18:55] me010 | ar are you know you are you planning to enter ?
[18:59] me010 | whatever that might be .
"[19:00] me010 | So that 's under that model then ,"
"[19:04] me010 | There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query , presumably give it to you ."
[19:08] mn048 | Yes .
[19:12] me010 | That would get expressed and then hopefully
"[19:14] me010 | you know , you 'd get an answer back ."
[19:17] mn048 | Yep .
[19:18] me010 | And that would of course the answer would have to be parsed .
[19:19] mn047 | Mmm .
[19:20] mn047 | Yep .
"[19:21] me010 | OK so , th that"
[19:21] mn048 | Yes .
"[19:23] me010 | uh , We probably won't do this early on ,"
[19:26] me010 | because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .
[19:27] mn048 | Yep .
[19:32] me010 | But
[19:33] me010 | While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up
[19:35] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[19:36] me010 | that
[19:38] me010 | it could be that
"[19:38] me010 | some months from now we said "" OK we 're now ready to"
"[19:41] me010 | try to close that loop """
[19:43] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[19:44] mn047 | Hmm .
[19:44] me010 | in terms of querying about some of these decisions .
[19:48] mn048 | Yep .
[19:51] mn048 | my suggestion then is that you um
[19:53] mn048 | look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the
[19:56] mn048 | action plans are supposed to look like .
[19:59] mn048 | And they 're currently um
[20:01] mn048 | Agreeing or or in the process of agreeing on an
[20:04] mn048 | X M L - ification of
[20:06] mn048 | um something like a
[20:08] mn048 | state - transition network
[20:10] mn048 | of how dialogues would proceed .
[20:13] mn048 | The these um transition networks
[20:15] mn048 | uh will be what the action planner
[20:17] mn048 | interprets in a sense .
[20:19] me010 | Hmm . D did you know this Robert ?
"[20:21] mn015 | uh Michael is doing that , right ?"
[20:23] mn048 | Well uh Marcus Lerkult is actually implementing that
[20:26] mn048 | stuff and Marcus and Michael together are
[20:29] mn048 | um
"[20:30] mn048 | leading the discussion there , yeah ."
[20:31] mn015 | OK .
[20:32] me010 | So we ha we have to get in on that .
[20:34] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[20:34] mn048 | Yep .
[20:34] me010 | because um
[20:34] mn047 | Mmm .
[20:36] mn048 | Definitely .
[20:37] me010 | partly those are like X - schemas .
[20:40] me010 | the transition diagrams .
[20:42] mn015 | Hmm .
[20:42] me010 | And it may be that that
[20:43] me010 | um we should early on make sure that they
[20:47] me010 | have the flexibility that we need .
[20:51] mn015 | But they uh
[20:53] mn015 | Have I understood this right ? They they govern more or less
[20:58] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[20:59] mn015 | It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's
"[21:06] mn015 | So , I mean there is this this this nice interf i"
"[21:10] me010 | So there 's ac so there th the word "" action "" , OK , is is what 's ambiguous here ."
[21:12] mn047 | I think .
[21:15] mn047 | Hmm .
[21:16] mn048 | Yes .
"[21:16] me010 | So , um"
[21:19] me010 | one thing
"[21:20] me010 | is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,"
"[21:24] me010 | per tells the person how to go , "" First go here , first go there"
[21:24] mn048 | OK .
[21:26] mn047 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:27] me010 | uh , you know , take a bus "" , whatever it is ."
[21:29] me010 | So that 's that form
"[21:31] me010 | of planning , and action , and a route planner and"
"[21:35] me010 | GIS , all sort of stuff ."
[21:37] me010 | uh
[21:39] me010 | But I think that
[21:40] me010 | isn't what you mean .
"[21:41] mn048 | No . No , in SmartKom terminology that 's um"
[21:44] mn048 | called a function that 's modeled
[21:46] mn048 | by a function modeler .
[21:48] mn048 | And it 's th that 's completely um
[21:50] mn048 | encapsulated from th the dialogue system .
[21:53] mn048 | That 's simply a functionality that you give
[21:55] mn048 | data as in a query and then you get
[21:57] mn048 | back from that
"[21:58] mn048 | mmm , a functioning model"
[22:00] mn048 | um which might be a planner or a VCR or whatever .
[22:03] mn048 | um some result and that 's then then used .
"[22:04] me010 | Well , OK , so that 's what I thought ."
[22:07] me010 | So action he action here means dia uh speech ac uh you know
"[22:08] mn048 | Yeah , yeah ."
[22:10] mn015 | Mmm .
"[22:10] mn048 | Yeah , in that in that sense yes , dialogue act , yeah ."
[22:11] me010 | dialogue act . Yeah .
[22:17] me010 | I think that 's not going to be
[22:19] me010 | good enough . I
[22:20] me010 | I don what uh what I meant by that .
"[22:22] me010 | So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea ."
[22:30] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[22:36] me010 | But I think that
[22:39] me010 | um
"[22:41] me010 | when so , when you get to the tourist domain"
[22:45] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[22:45] me010 | it 's not just an information retrieval system .
[22:48] me010 | Right ? So this i this is where
[22:48] mn048 | Clearly . Yes .
[22:50] me010 | I think this people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully .
[22:53] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:53] me010 | So , if it 's only like in in the in the film and T V thing ,"
"[22:59] me010 | OK , you can do this . And you just get information and give it to people ."
[23:02] me010 | But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on
[23:07] mn048 | Yep .
[23:11] me010 | I d I think the notion of this as a self contained
[23:15] me010 | uh module
[23:17] me010 | you know th the functional module that that
[23:21] mn048 | Yep .
[23:23] me010 | probably is too restrictive .
[23:26] me010 | Now I dunno how much people
[23:28] me010 | have thought ahead
[23:30] me010 | to the tourist domain in this
"[23:32] mn048 | Probably not enough , I mean"
[23:33] mn048 | an another uh more basic point there is
[23:36] mn048 | that the current um tasks and therefore th the concepts in this ac
[23:41] mn048 | what 's called the action plan and what 's really the dialogue manager .
[23:42] me010 | Yeah
[23:44] mn048 | um
[23:45] mn048 | is based on slots that have to be filled and the um
[23:47] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[23:48] mn048 | kind of values in these slots would be fixed things like the
[23:51] mn048 | a time or a movie title or something like
[23:53] me010 | Right .
[23:53] mn048 | this whereas in the a
[23:54] mn048 | um tourist domain it might be an entire route .
[23:57] me010 | Indeed .
"[23:57] mn048 | Set - based , or even"
[23:58] mn048 | very complex structured information in these slots and
[23:59] me010 | Right .
[24:01] mn048 | I 'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really
[24:05] mn048 | um being taken into consideration .
[24:09] me010 | OK . Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?
[24:09] mn048 | So that 's that 's really something we
[24:17] mn015 | Yep .
[24:17] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[24:18] mn015 | rea
[24:18] mn048 | I mean nothing 's being
[24:20] mn015 | yep
[24:22] mn015 | Mm - hmm yeah
[24:26] mn015 | because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to
[24:33] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[24:36] mn048 | Yes .
[24:36] mn015 | to Markus and Michael .
[24:37] mn047 | Mmm .
[24:37] mn048 | Yep .
[24:38] mn015 | And um
[24:41] mn015 | mmm
[24:43] mn015 | You don't know OK th
[24:47] mn015 | I 'll I 'll talk to Michael
[24:48] mn015 | it 's what I do anyway . Who How far is the uh
[24:53] mn015 | the the M - three - L specification
[24:55] mn015 | for for the la natural language input gone on the the uh I haven't seen anything
[25:02] mn015 | for the uh tourist path domain .
"[25:04] mn047 | Yeah , it 's it 's not defined yet ."
"[25:07] mn015 | And um you are probably also involved in that , right ?"
[25:09] mn047 | Yeah .
"[25:10] mn015 | uh together with the usual gang , um Petra and Jan"
"[25:15] mn047 | Yeah , there 's a meeting"
[25:17] mn047 | next
[25:18] mn047 | next week I think
[25:22] mn015 | OK because
[25:36] mn015 | and how that is uh specified .
[25:38] mn015 | I didn't think of the internal working of the uh
[25:43] mn015 | the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant .
[25:48] mn015 | Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention .
[25:54] mn015 | And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be .
[25:54] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[25:58] mn015 | But um the internal workings of
[26:03] mn015 | action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata .
[26:08] mn015 | So that shouldn't really matter too much .
[26:10] mn015 | I mean it does matter because it does have to keep track of you we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth
"[26:17] me010 | Yeah , th there there I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters ."
[26:17] mn048 | Right .
"[26:20] me010 | OK , so that"
"[26:23] me010 | uh , for example , the i it 's the action planner"
[26:27] me010 | is going to take some spec and s
[26:29] me010 | make some suggestions about what the user should do .
[26:35] me010 | What the user says
[26:37] me010 | after that
[26:38] me010 | is going to be very much caught up with what
[26:42] mn048 | Yes .
[26:45] me010 | If the parser and the
[26:48] me010 | language end
[26:48] me010 | doesn't know what the person 's been told
[26:51] me010 | OK th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .
[26:54] mn015 | Yeah .
[26:55] me010 | Right ? So if someone says the best t
"[26:58] me010 | to uh go there is by taxi ,"
"[27:01] me010 | let 's say . Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast , take a taxi ."
[27:06] me010 | OK . And
[27:08] me010 | the language end doesn't know that .
"[27:11] me010 | OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be"
[27:14] mn048 | hmm
[27:15] me010 | just fine .
[27:16] me010 | uh
[27:16] mn015 | Yeah .
[27:17] mn048 | That would b but that I think that that uh point has been realized and
[27:21] mn048 | it 's it 's not really um
[27:23] mn048 | been defined yet but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from
[27:27] mn048 | uh the action planner
"[27:28] mn048 | into all the analysis modules ,"
[27:30] mn048 | telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is .
[27:31] mn047 | Mmm .
[27:35] mn048 | Beyond what 's currently being implemented which is just word lists .
"[27:38] me010 | Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse ."
[27:39] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[27:40] mn048 | Of of special interest .
[27:41] me010 | This is actually the state of the plan .
[27:43] me010 | That 's why
[27:44] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:45] mn048 | Yes , Yes , Mm - hmm yeah ."
[27:47] me010 | z and s
"[27:49] me010 | uh , It 's great if people are already"
[27:51] me010 | taking that into account .
[27:53] me010 | But
[27:55] me010 | One would have t have to see see the details .
[27:57] mn048 | The specifics aren't really there yet . Yes .
[27:59] me010 | Yeah .
"[28:01] me010 | So anyway , Robert , that 's why I was thinking that"
[28:03] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[28:03] me010 | um
[28:09] me010 | the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback
[28:12] mn048 | hmm
[28:13] me010 | from the planning end .
[28:14] me010 | In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff .
[28:21] mn048 | Yeah .
[28:21] mn047 | Mmm .
[28:24] mn048 | And even on on a more basic level the the action planner
[28:27] mn048 | actually needs to be able to have
[28:29] mn048 | um
[28:30] mn048 | an expressive power that can deal with these structures .
[28:34] me010 | Hmm ?
[28:34] mn048 | And not just um say
[28:36] mn048 | um um the dialogue um will consist of ten possible states
[28:42] mn048 | and th these states really are fixed in in a certain sense .
[28:45] me010 | Would there be any chance
"[28:47] me010 | of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a "" dialogue planner "" ?"
[28:53] me010 | Because there 's this other thing
[28:53] mn048 | That 'd be nice .
[28:54] me010 | The o There 's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is gonna be
[28:58] me010 | a route planner or It 's really gonna be an action planner .
[29:05] mn048 | It oughta be called a a dialogue manager .
[29:07] mn048 | cuz that 's what everybody else calls it . Yeah .
"[29:07] me010 | I would think , yeah ."
"[29:10] me010 | So , s"
[29:11] me010 | So what would happen if we sent a note saying
"[29:14] me010 | "" Gee we 've talked about this and couldn't we change this"
"[29:16] me010 | uh th the whole word ? "" I have no idea how complicated these things are ."
[29:21] mn015 | Probably close to impossible .
[29:24] mn048 | Depends on who you talk to how . We 'll see .
"[29:28] mn048 | I 'll go check , cause I completely agree ."
[29:30] mn047 | Mmm .
"[29:30] mn048 | Yeah , and I think this is just"
[29:32] mn048 | for historical reasons within
"[29:34] mn048 | uh , the preparation phase of the project and not because somebody actually believes it ought to be action planner ."
[29:40] mn048 | So if there is resistance
"[29:41] mn048 | against changing it , that 's just because "" Oh , We don't want to change things . """
[29:44] mn048 | That that not deep reason
"[29:47] me010 | OK , anyway ."
[29:49] me010 | I if if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term .
[29:52] me010 | for the
[29:54] me010 | thing that actually
[29:55] me010 | does the planning of the uh
[29:58] me010 | routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist .
[30:01] mn015 | That 's external services .
"[30:03] me010 | Yeah , but that 's not g eh tha"
[30:06] me010 | That ha has all the wrong connotations .
[30:09] me010 | it 's it sounds like it 's you know
"[30:10] me010 | stand alone . It doesn't interact , it doesn't"
[30:15] me010 | That 's why I 'm saying . I think you can't it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV . You go to th
[30:21] me010 | but I I I I
[30:24] me010 | think it 's really really wrong headed for
[30:27] me010 | something that you that
"[30:28] me010 | has a lot of state , it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts ."
[30:31] mn015 | Yeah .
[30:34] mn015 | Yeah I think just the the spatial planner and the route planner
[30:41] me010 | Right .
[30:43] mn015 | a printout of the communication between those two fills up
[30:46] mn015 | I don't know how many pages and that 's just part of how do I get to one place . It 's really insane . and uh
[30:47] mn048 | Hmm
[30:55] mn015 | but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh
[30:59] mn015 | Michael into the discussion .
"[31:01] mn015 | Or to enter his discussion , actually ."
[31:03] mn015 | That 's the way around .
"[31:03] mn048 | Yeah , Marcus ."
[31:04] mn015 | Markus
[31:08] mn015 | Is he new in the in the ?
[31:09] mn048 | Wh - where 's ?
"[31:10] mn048 | Yeah , he 's he started um"
[31:10] mn047 | Yeah .
[31:12] mn048 | I think January .
[31:15] mn048 | And he 's
[31:16] mn048 | gonna be responsible for the implementation of this action planner .
[31:19] mn048 | Dialogue manager .
[31:22] mn015 | Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ?
"[31:25] mn048 | No , no he 's"
[31:26] mn048 | completely gonna rewrite everything .
[31:27] mn015 | OK .
[31:28] mn048 | In Java .
[31:30] mn048 | OK so that 's interesting .
[31:31] mn015 | Yes I was just that 's my next question whether we 're we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not .
[31:32] mn048 | hmm
"[31:35] mn048 | No . No , that 's gonna be phased out ."
[31:36] me010 | Yeah .
[31:37] mn015 | OK
[31:44] mn015 | makes sense in a in a certain light because
[31:44] mn048 | Yeah .
"[31:46] mn015 | the action planner should not be or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w have to worry about whether it 's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way huh , it j"
[31:57] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[31:58] me010 | I I totally agree . Sure .
[32:00] me010 | Yeah I I agree . There is there 's a logic to dialogue which which is is separable .
[32:05] me010 | I
[32:06] me010 | Yeah .
[32:08] mn015 | sort of formulate its
"[32:11] mn015 | what it wants in a in a rather a abstract uh way , you know f"
[32:15] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:16] mn015 | "" Find me a good route for this . """
[32:18] mn015 | It doesn't really have to worry ab how route planner A or how route planner B actually wants it .
[32:26] mn015 | seemed like a good idea .
[32:29] mn015 | In the beginning .
[32:30] me010 | It 's tricky .
[32:31] me010 | It 's tricky because one could well imagine I think it will turn out to be the case that
"[32:36] me010 | uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n"
[32:40] me010 | uh
[32:41] me010 | knowledge modeler
[32:42] me010 | will fill in some parameters about what the person wants . One could well imagine
[32:46] me010 | that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed
"[32:49] me010 | uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user ."
[32:56] me010 | You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something .
[33:03] me010 | And so y you would like it t also be able to
[33:03] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[33:07] me010 | uh formulate
[33:09] me010 | a query .
[33:12] me010 | And to run that back through
[33:15] me010 | uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around .
[33:20] mn015 | hmm
[33:21] me010 | And a I a a good design would would
"[33:23] mn015 | a lot of , yeah"
[33:23] me010 | allow that to happen .
[33:24] mn047 | Mmm .
[33:25] me010 | If if you know if if you can't make it happen then you you do your best .
[33:27] mn048 | but that doesn't necessarily contradict um
[33:30] mn048 | an architecture where there really is a pers a def well - defined interface .
[33:33] me010 | I totally agree . But but what it nee but th what the point is the in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven .
[33:34] mn048 | and and
[33:40] me010 | So the dialogue manager may think it 's in a dialogue state
[33:45] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:46] me010 | one of these planning modules comes along and says "" hey , right now we need"
"[33:49] me010 | to ask a question "" ."
[33:51] me010 | So that forces the dialogue manager to change state .
[33:54] mn048 | Yes
[33:55] me010 | OK .
[33:55] me010 | It could be y
"[33:55] mn048 | Sure , ye yeah I I think that 's that 's the um"
"[33:58] mn048 | concept that people have , yep ."
[33:58] me010 | OK .
[34:05] mn048 | And and the the underlying idea of course is
[34:07] mn048 | that there is something like
[34:08] mn048 | kernel modules with kernel functionality that you can plug uh
[34:11] mn048 | certain applications like tourist information or
[34:15] mn048 | um the home scenario with uh controlling a VCR and so on .
[34:20] mn048 | And then extend it to
[34:21] mn048 | an arbitrary number of applications eventually .
[34:25] mn048 | So wouldn't
[34:25] mn048 | That 's an additional reason to have this
[34:28] mn048 | well - defined interface and keep these things like uh tourist information external .
"[34:29] me010 | Oh , yeah , yeah ."
[34:33] mn048 | And then call it external services .
[34:34] mn015 | Hmm .
[34:39] mn048 | But of course the the more complex yep .
[34:51] mn015 | a service is gonna come and describe itself to you .
[34:54] mn015 | and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in in in the DAML
[34:57] mn048 | Yeah .
[34:58] mn015 | uh project where
"[35:03] mn015 | that gives you information on Berkeley , and it 's it 's gonna"
[35:06] mn015 | be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things .
[35:09] mn015 | and so you can actually interface to such a system without
[35:12] mn015 | ever having met it before and
[35:14] mn048 | Hmm .
[35:14] mn015 | the function modeler and a self - description of the
[35:18] mn015 | um external service haggle it out and
"[35:22] mn015 | you can use the same language core , understanding core"
"[35:25] mn015 | to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth ."
[35:25] mn048 | Hmm .
[35:25] mn047 | Mmm .
"[35:31] mn015 | completely utopian at the moment , but"
"[35:34] mn015 | slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh"
[35:37] mn015 | contingent .
[35:38] mn048 | Hmm .
[35:44] mn015 | But we are facing of course much more
[35:47] mn015 | um
[35:49] mn015 | realistic problems .
"[35:51] mn015 | And language input for example , is of course"
[35:53] mn015 | uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision .
[35:59] mn015 | um
"[36:00] mn015 | Then of course , the uh"
"[36:02] mn015 | um , you know"
"[36:03] mn015 | what is it poverty of the stimulus , yet the m"
[36:05] mn015 | uh the less we get of that the better .
"[36:08] mn015 | and um so we we 're thinking , for example"
[36:11] mn015 | how much syntactic analysis actually happens already in the parser .
[36:15] mn047 | Hmm .
[36:15] mn015 | and whether one could interface to that
[36:17] mn015 | potentially
"[36:18] mn047 | Yeah , are there currently is uh no syntactic analysis"
[36:22] mn047 | but in the next release there will be some .
[36:26] mn047 | unless and it 's um
[36:29] mn047 | uh you can access this
[36:31] me010 | S so uh y we we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .
[36:36] mn047 | Hmm .
[36:37] me010 | And as you say it 's just a surface pattern matcher .
"[36:40] me010 | Uh , So what are what are the plans roughly ?"
[36:43] mn047 | um
[36:44] mn047 | it 's to to integrate and syntactic analysis .
[36:48] mn047 | and um
[36:50] mn047 | add some more features like segmentation .
[36:58] mn047 | There um there 's often
[37:02] mn047 | uh pause between it
[37:03] mn047 | and a segmentation occurs .
[37:09] mn047 | um
[37:12] me010 | So the idea is to uh have a pa y y a particular Do you have a particular parser in mind ? Is it
[37:13] mn047 | yeah
[37:21] me010 | uh partic d I mean have you thought through ?
[37:25] me010 | Is it an HPSG parser ? Is it a whatever ?
[37:28] mn047 | No no it 's uh I think it 's
[37:30] mn047 | it 's totally complicated for
[37:32] mn047 | it 's just one one person and so
[37:32] me010 | OK .
"[37:35] me010 | Oh , you have to do it . You have to do it , yeah ."
[37:39] mn047 | things must be simpler
"[37:41] me010 | I see , so"
"[37:42] mn047 | but uh , Miel syntactic analysis with um finite state transducers ."
[37:43] me010 | But the people at D F -
[37:46] me010 | Yeah .
[37:47] me010 | People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers .
"[37:50] me010 | Other you know , people over the years ."
[37:53] me010 | uh have written various parsers at DFKI . None of them
[37:56] me010 | are suitable ?
[37:57] me010 | I I I d I 'm asking . I don't know .
"[37:59] mn047 | Yeah , uh the problem is"
[38:00] mn047 | th that it has to be very fast because um if you want to for more than one path anywhere
[38:04] me010 | OK .
[38:08] mn047 | what 's in the latches from the
[38:09] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[38:10] mn047 | speech recognizer so it 's
[38:12] mn047 | speed is crucial . uh
[38:15] mn047 | And they are not fast enough .
[38:18] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[38:20] mn047 | And they also have to be very robust .
[38:23] mn047 | cuz of um speech recognition errors and
[38:26] me010 | OK .
"[38:27] me010 | So , um So there was a chunk parser"
[38:27] mn047 | @ @
"[38:31] me010 | in Verbmobil ,"
[38:33] me010 | that was one of the
[38:35] me010 | uh
[38:36] me010 | branchers . You know they d th I c There were these various
"[38:39] me010 | uh , competing"
[38:43] me010 | uh syntax modules .
[38:45] me010 | And I know one of them was a chunk parser and I don't remember
[38:51] mn047 | I think it 's
[38:51] mn015 | A Alan ?
[38:52] mn047 | that
"[38:54] mn047 | might , at Tuebingen I thought ."
[38:56] me010 | Yeah I d I don't remember .
[38:57] mn047 | was Do you know something about that ?
[39:05] mn048 | can't quite recall
[39:07] mn048 | whether they actually produced the chunks in the first place .
[39:10] mn047 | oh
"[39:10] me010 | Uh . I see . Yeah , that 's right ."
[39:12] mn048 | Or wh
"[39:12] mn047 | Oh from from Stuttgart , yeah , also"
[39:16] me010 | the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid and then there was a
[39:20] me010 | kind of trying to fit them together that
[39:22] mn048 | Right .
[39:22] me010 | h used more context . Right ?
[39:23] mn048 | Yeah
[39:25] mn048 | Well you s
[39:26] mn048 | and and especially you
[39:27] mn048 | did some some
"[39:29] mn048 | um , l"
[39:30] mn048 | um
[39:31] mn048 | was a learning - based approach which
[39:33] mn048 | learned from a big corpus of of trees .
[39:34] me010 | Right . Right .
[39:34] mn047 | Mm - hmm .
[39:35] mn048 | And yes the it the chunk parser was a finite - state machine that
[39:38] mn048 | um Mark Light originally w
[39:40] mn048 | worked on in while he was in
[39:42] mn048 | Tuebingen and then somebody else in Tuebingen
"[39:44] mn048 | picked that up . So it was done in Tuebingen , yeah ."
[39:46] mn048 | Definitely .
[39:46] me010 | But is that the kind of thing y It sounds like
[39:48] me010 | the kind of thing that you were thinking of .
[39:51] mn047 | yeah . yeah that 's
[39:51] mn048 | Yeah I guess it 's similar .
"[39:54] mn047 | In this direction , yes"
[39:56] me010 | What ?
"[39:56] mn047 | Yeah , it 's in in this direction ."
[40:00] me010 | Hmm .
"[40:02] mn015 | From Michael Strube , I 've heard very good stuff about the chunk parser that is done by FORWISS ,"
"[40:09] mn015 | uh ,"
[40:10] mn015 | which is in
[40:11] mn015 | embassy doing the parsing .
[40:14] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[40:15] mn015 | So this is sort of came as a surprise to me that
[40:19] mn015 | is featuring a nice parser
[40:21] mn015 | but it 's what I hear .
[40:24] mn015 | One could also look at that and see
"[40:24] mn047 | Mm - hmm , yeah , it would be very interesting , Mm - hmm ."
[40:26] mn015 | whether there is some synergy
"[40:28] mn047 | Mmm , yeah ."
[40:28] mn015 | possible .
[40:29] mn015 | And they 're doing
[40:33] mn015 | I I can give you the names of the people who do it there .
[40:36] mn015 | But um .
[40:40] mn015 | Then there is of course more ways of parsing things .
[40:44] me010 | Of course . But But
[40:45] me010 | uh given th the
"[40:47] me010 | constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth ,"
[40:51] me010 | my guess is you 're
[40:52] me010 | probably into some kind of chunk parsing .
[40:56] me010 | And
[40:57] me010 | uh
[40:59] me010 | I 'm not a big believer in this um
[41:03] me010 | statistical
"[41:05] me010 | you know , cleaning up"
[41:06] me010 | uh
[41:12] me010 | That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh
[41:16] me010 | you can't
[41:17] me010 | do it any other way .
[41:19] me010 | uh
[41:20] me010 | but I dunno . It may i i may be that 's what you guys finally decide do .
[41:21] mn047 | Hmm .
[41:25] me010 | Uh .
[41:29] mn047 | Mm - hmm .
[41:30] me010 | There is this this one that they did at SRI some years ago Fastus ?
[41:38] mn047 | but it 's no not much uh information available .
[41:41] me010 | ah !
"[41:42] mn047 | I found , but it 's also"
"[41:44] mn047 | finite - state transducers , I thought ."
[41:45] me010 | It is . Yeah . I mean it 's it was pretty ambitious .
[41:47] mn047 | and
"[41:47] me010 | And of course it was English oriented , um"
"[41:49] mn047 | Yeah , and and"
[41:51] me010 | w
[41:51] mn047 | Purely finite - state transducers are not so good for German since there 's um
[41:56] me010 | Right .
[41:57] mn047 | The word order is is uh not fixed
[42:00] me010 | And English is all th all word order .
[42:03] mn047 | Yeah .
[42:08] me010 | in German you 've got
[42:09] me010 | uh most of this done with
"[42:13] mn047 | Yes , uh the"
[42:14] mn047 | um choice between uh this processing and that processing and my template matcher .
[42:18] me010 | Right .
[42:20] me010 | Right .
[42:21] me010 | So what about
[42:21] mn047 | @ @
[42:22] me010 | Um
[42:25] me010 | Did y like Morfix ?
[42:26] me010 | a a e y you 've got stemmers ? Or is that something
"[42:30] mn047 | Um , yeah but it 's all in the in the lexicon ."
[42:34] me010 | But did you have that ?
[42:36] mn047 | Yeah th the information is available .
[42:42] me010 | So y you just
[42:44] me010 | connect to the lexicon
[42:45] mn047 | Yeah
[42:45] me010 | and uh at least for German you have all all of the uh
[42:50] me010 | the stemming information .
"[42:51] mn047 | Yeah , we can , oh yeah ."
[42:53] mn047 | We have knowledge bases from from Verbmobil
[42:55] me010 | Yep .
[43:01] me010 | Right .
[43:06] me010 | But it it it doesn't look like i you 're using it .
[43:09] me010 | I didn't n see it being used in the current
[43:12] me010 | template uh parser .
[43:15] me010 | I I didn't see any
[43:16] me010 | Uh of course we l actually only looked at the English .
[43:20] mn047 | um
[43:22] me010 | I don't remember . So w wha
"[43:23] mn047 | Yeah , but but it 's used for for stem forms ."
[43:28] mn047 | @ @
"[43:29] mn047 | Oh , OK ."
[43:30] mn048 | Morphix is not used on - line .
[43:33] mn048 | s so the lexicon might be derived
[43:33] mn047 | What ?
[43:34] mn048 | by Morphix but
[43:35] me010 | Right .
[43:36] mn048 | What what 's happening on - line is
[43:37] mn048 | just um
[43:39] mn048 | a retrieval from the lexicon which would
[43:42] mn048 | give all the stemming information so it would be a full foreign lexicon .
[43:42] me010 | Right .
[43:42] mn047 | Hmm .
[43:46] me010 | And that 's what you have .
[43:47] mn047 | Yeah
[43:47] mn048 | Yep .
[43:48] me010 | OK .
[43:49] me010 | What uh I didn't reme
[43:49] mn015 | We threw out all the forms .
[43:51] me010 | Huh ?
[43:55] mn047 | Mm - hmm .
[43:56] me010 | So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the in the pattern matcher or not ?
[44:02] mn047 | um Not yet but it 's planned to do that .
[44:04] me010 | OK .
[44:06] me010 | Cuz I r I didn't reme I didn't think I saw it .
[44:08] mn047 | Yeah
"[44:12] me010 | Oh , I haven yeah that 's getting it from the lexicon is just fine ."
"[44:15] mn048 | Sure , right ."
[44:15] mn047 | Oh yes .
[44:18] me010 | um
[44:21] me010 | Yeah and here 's the case where the English and the German might really be
[44:25] me010 | significantly different .
[44:27] me010 | In terms of
[44:28] me010 | if you 're trying to build some fast parser
[44:35] me010 | You really might wanna do it in a significantly different way .
[44:42] me010 | So you 've you guys have looked at this ?
[44:45] me010 | also ? in terms of
"[44:47] me010 | You know , w if you 're doing this for English as well as German"
[44:52] me010 | Um
[44:53] me010 | Do you think now that it would be this doing it similarly ?
[44:57] mn047 | um
"[45:00] mn047 | Yeah , it 's um"
"[45:02] mn047 | I think it 's um yes ,"
[45:06] mn047 | to do list processing .
[45:08] mn047 | and
[45:09] mn047 | Maybe this is um
[45:11] mn047 | more adequate for English and in German um
[45:15] mn047 | set processing is used .
[45:19] mn047 | Maybe yeah .
[45:21] mn047 | Some extensions uh have to be made .
[45:24] mn047 | For for a English version
[45:31] me010 | Mmm .
[45:37] me010 | Not easy .
[45:38] mn015 | Well there 's m I 'm sure there 's gonna be more discussion on that after your talk .
"[45:42] mn047 | Mm - hmm , yeah ."
[45:42] me010 | Right .
[45:42] mn015 | We 're just gonna foreshadow what we saw that
[45:46] mn015 | and um
"[45:54] me010 | Now actually ,"
[45:55] me010 | um
[45:58] me010 | Are you guys free at five ?
[46:01] me010 | Or Do you have to go somewhere at five o ' clock tonight ?
[46:03] me010 | W in ten minutes ?
[46:04] mn047 | Ah mmm .
[46:05] mn047 | No .
[46:06] mn047 | Oder there was an talk ? uh
"[46:08] mn048 | Yeah , there there 's the um"
[46:10] mn048 | practice talk .
[46:10] me010 | Great . So you 're going to that .
[46:11] mn048 | @ @
"[46:11] mn048 | Yeah , that that 's what we were planning to do . Yeah ."
"[46:12] me010 | That 's good , because that will"
"[46:12] mn047 | Mmm , yeah ."
[46:14] me010 | uh tell you
[46:16] me010 | a fair amount about
[46:19] me010 | The
[46:23] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[46:24] mn047 | Ah .
[46:24] me010 | So I th I think that probably as good an introduction
[46:28] me010 | as you 'll get .
[46:30] me010 | Uh to
[46:32] me010 | the form of of
[46:34] me010 | uh conceptual grammar that that w we
[46:36] me010 | have in mind for this .
"[46:38] mn047 | Mmm , ah ."
[46:39] me010 | It won't
[46:41] me010 | talk particularly
[46:43] me010 | about how that relates to what
[46:46] me010 | uh Robert was saying at the beginning . But let me give you a very short version of this .
[46:50] me010 | So we talked about the fact that
[46:54] me010 | There 're going to be
[46:55] me010 | a certain number of decisions
"[46:58] me010 | That you want the knowledge modeler to make ,"
"[47:03] me010 | that will be then fed to the function module ,"
[47:08] me010 | that does
"[47:09] me010 | uh , route planning ."
"[47:11] me010 | It 's called the "" route planner "" or something ."
[47:12] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[47:13] me010 | So there are these decisions . And then
[47:16] me010 | one half of this we talked about at little bit is
"[47:19] me010 | how if you had the right information , if you knew something about what was said and about th the something about"
[47:26] me010 | was the agent
"[47:28] me010 | a tourist or a native or a business person or uh young or old , whatever ."
"[47:34] me010 | That information , and also about the"
"[47:37] me010 | Uh , what we 're calling "" the entity "" ,"
"[47:39] me010 | Is it a castle , is it a bank ? Is it a s town square , is it a statue ?"
[47:44] me010 | Whatever .
[47:45] me010 | So all that kind of information could be combined
[47:48] me010 | into decision networks and give you decisions .
[47:51] me010 | But the other half of the problem is
[47:53] me010 | How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?
"[48:01] me010 | So , um"
"[48:03] me010 | So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh we 're trying to build a templ you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that"
[48:11] mn047 | Mmm .
[48:15] me010 | he wants to take a picture .
[48:17] me010 | OK ? And and we could you could do this .
[48:22] mn047 | Mmm .
[48:23] me010 | OK . You could do this . But
[48:25] me010 | uh from our point of view this is also a research project
[48:29] me010 | and there are a couple of people not here
"[48:31] me010 | for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,"
[48:34] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[48:35] me010 | and
[48:37] me010 | the idea that we 're really after
[48:39] me010 | is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics and the notion that there are a relatively small number
[48:48] me010 | of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity .
[48:54] me010 | So a typical one in this formulation is a container .
[48:59] me010 | So this is a static thing .
[49:00] me010 | And the notion is that
[49:04] me010 | all sorts of physical situations
[49:07] me010 | are characterized in terms of containers . Going in and out
[49:09] me010 | the portals and con OK .
[49:10] mn047 | Mmm .
"[49:12] me010 | But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical"
[49:17] me010 | things are also characterized this way . You get in trouble and you know et cetera and so s
[49:19] mn047 | Mmm .
"[49:21] me010 | So , what we 're really trying to do"
[49:24] me010 | is to map from the discourse
[49:27] me010 | to the conceptual semantics level .
[49:30] me010 | And from there
[49:31] me010 | to the appropriate decisions .
"[49:35] me010 | So another one of these primitive ,"
[49:35] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:38] me010 | what are called "" image schemas "" ,"
[49:40] me010 | is uh goal seeking .
"[49:43] me010 | So this a notion of a source ,"
[49:43] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:45] me010 | path , goal ,"
"[49:46] me010 | trajector , possibly obstacles ."
[49:48] me010 | And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive .
"[49:52] me010 | And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal . So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance"
[49:52] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:06] me010 | and say "" Aha !"
[50:07] me010 | th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal .
"[50:10] me010 | The goal is this , the pers the , uh traveller is that , uh the sor w where we are at now is is this , they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . """
[50:20] me010 | So th the and this is an again attempt to get
"[50:24] me010 | very wide coverage . So if you can do this ,"
"[50:28] me010 | then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface ."
[50:28] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[50:35] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:38] me010 | And then ,"
[50:40] me010 | uh
"[50:42] me010 | The processing of that , both on the input end ,"
"[50:46] me010 | recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera ,"
"[50:52] me010 | and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then"
[50:58] me010 | uh make decisions about what actions to take .
"[51:02] me010 | Provides , they claim ,"
"[51:05] me010 | a very powerful , general"
[51:07] me010 | notion of deep semantics .
[51:10] me010 | So that 's what we 're really doing .
[51:12] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[51:14] me010 | And Nancy is going to Her talk
"[51:19] me010 | is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn"
[51:25] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[51:25] me010 | this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .
"[51:26] mn048 | Yep , yep ."
[51:32] mn048 | And how do you envision
[51:33] mn048 | um the the um
[51:35] mn048 | this deep semantic to be
[51:37] mn048 | worked with . Would it be highly ambiguous
[51:39] mn048 | if and then there would be another module that takes that
[51:43] mn048 | um highly underspecified
[51:45] mn048 | deep semantic construction and map it onto the current context to find out what the person
[51:50] mn048 | really was talking about
"[51:52] me010 | Well that 's that 's that 's where the belief - net comes in . So th the idea is ,"
[51:56] me010 | let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower .
[51:59] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:59] me010 | So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w if it works right , OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place and that 's their goal and there will be additional situational information ."
[52:10] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:12] mn048 | Oh , OK ."
"[52:13] me010 | Uh , OK , part of it comes from the ontology . The tower is this kind of object . Part of it comes from the user model ."
[52:13] mn048 | th
[52:16] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:16] mn048 | Yeah , OK ."
[52:19] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
[52:19] me010 | And the idea of the belief - net is it combines
[52:22] me010 | the
"[52:23] me010 | information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,"
[52:28] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:28] me010 | you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior ,"
[52:30] mn048 | Yeah
[52:30] me010 | along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved and about the situation
"[52:37] me010 | about "" Is it raining ? "" I don't know . Whatever it is . And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out ."
[52:43] mn048 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:44] me010 | And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation ."
[52:52] mn048 | Yeah .
[52:55] mn047 | Hmm .
"[52:58] me010 | But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that , just about the"
"[52:59] mn048 | Yeah , oh yeah , I see , yeah yeah , really ."
[53:01] me010 | um
[53:04] mn015 | First steps .
[53:05] me010 | Right . The the construction grammar .
[53:11] mn015 | And she 's gonna start
[53:12] mn015 | in a minute .
[53:12] me010 | In a minute .
"[53:13] mn047 | Ah , OK ."
[53:14] me010 | OK .
[53:19] mn036 | five - A ?
[53:21] mn048 | Alright .

[00:00] me013 | No .
[00:00] fe016 | No .
[00:01] me013 | No .
"[00:01] me013 | There 's another I don't know . It starts with a P or something . I forget the word for it ,"
[00:04] fe016 | Oh .
[00:04] me013 | but it 's it 's um
[00:06] me013 | Typically when you you 're ab r
"[00:07] me013 | starting around forty for most people ,"
[00:09] me013 | it starts to harden and then it 's just harder for the lens to
[00:10] fe016 | Oh .
[00:14] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[00:19] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:19] me013 | to see it .
"[00:20] me013 | In fact , uh m my brother 's a gerontological psychologist and he he uh"
[00:25] me013 | came up with an an uh a uh body age test which uh
[00:28] me013 | gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st statistical predictors of all the rest of it .
[00:33] me013 | And one of them is is the distance
[00:37] me013 | Yeah .
"[00:38] me011 | We 're we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here"
[00:40] fe016 | Oh .
[00:41] me013 | Oh . Yeah . About how old I am . OK .
[00:43] me011 | Yep . We can edit that out if you want .
"[00:45] me013 | No , that 's OK ."
[00:45] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[00:46] me011 | OK . So .
[00:46] fe016 | You know .
[00:47] me011 | This time the form
"[00:49] me011 | discussion should be very short , right ?"
[00:51] me013 | It also should be later .
[00:53] me011 | OK .
[00:53] me013 | Because Jane uh is not here yet .
[00:56] me011 | Good point .
[00:57] me013 | And uh she 'll be most interested in that .
"[01:03] me013 | just uh , I don't think we should go though an elaborate thing ,"
[01:06] me013 | but um uh Jose and I were just talking about
[01:10] me013 | the uh
"[01:11] me013 | uh , speech e energy thing ,"
[01:13] mn005 | Yeah .
"[01:14] me013 | and I uh We didn't talk about the derivatives . But I think ,"
"[01:16] me013 | you know , the the i"
"[01:18] me013 | if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit ,"
"[01:21] me013 | Uh . Right now , that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction ,"
[01:24] me013 | but uh but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at .
[01:29] me013 | Um . And uh one is that uh this is all in log energy and log energy is basically compressing the distances
[01:35] me013 | uh between things .
[01:37] me013 | Um Another is that he needs to play with the the different uh uh temporal
[01:42] me013 | sizes . He was he he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds
"[01:46] me013 | uh , and uh he 's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows , as we discussed before ."
[01:51] me013 | Um
[02:03] me013 | may not be the right thing to do .
[02:05] mn005 | Hi . Yeah .
[02:05] me011 | Hi Jane !
[02:05] me011 | We just started .
[02:07] me011 | Could you take that mike there ?
"[02:07] fe016 | Are these the long term means ? Like , over the whole I mean ,"
[02:11] fe016 | the means of what ?
[02:12] me011 | Thanks .
[02:13] me013 | No .
[02:14] me013 | Neither . It 's uh between the pauses uh for some segment .
[02:14] mn005 | No .
[02:15] fe016 | Oh .
[02:17] me013 | And so i i his his He 's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .
[02:18] fe016 | Oh .
"[02:25] me013 | still at the frame level ,"
[02:26] fe016 | Right .
[02:27] me013 | and then and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount .
"[02:31] me013 | But one thing he was pointing out is when he he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain , it is actually pretty hard to see"
[02:37] me013 | the change .
"[02:38] me013 | And you can sort of see that , because of j of just"
[02:40] me013 | putting it on the board that
[02:40] mn005 | Yep .
[02:42] me013 | if you sort of have log - X plus
"[02:43] me013 | log - X ,"
"[02:44] me013 | that 's the log of X plus the log of two and it 's just , you know , it it diminishes the effect of having two of them ."
[02:45] mn005 | Mmm . Yeah .
[02:49] mn005 | @ @
"[02:50] fe016 | But you could do like a C D F there instead ? I mean , we don't know that the distribution here is"
[02:50] me013 | Um .
"[02:54] me013 | Yes , right ."
[02:54] fe016 | normally .
"[02:57] me013 | Actually , a PDF ."
"[02:58] me013 | But , you know , uh"
[02:58] fe016 | PDF
"[02:59] me013 | But , either way . Yeah ."
[03:00] fe016 | Yeah .
[03:00] mn005 | Yeah .
"[03:00] me013 | Yeah , eith eith uh"
[03:01] fe016 | Something like that where it 's sort of data driven .
"[03:04] me013 | B Yeah , but I think also"
[03:06] me013 | u
[03:06] me013 | I think a good first indicator is when the the the researcher looks at
[03:11] me013 | examples of the data
[03:13] me013 | and can not see
"[03:15] me013 | a change in how big the the signal is ,"
[03:19] mn005 | Yeah .
"[03:19] me013 | Then , that 's a problem"
[03:21] me013 | right there .
[03:21] mn005 | Yeah .
[03:22] me013 | So .
[03:22] fe016 | Oh yeah .
"[03:22] me013 | I think you should at least be able ,"
"[03:23] me013 | doing casual looking and can get the sense , "" Hey , there 's something there . "" and then you can play around with the measures ."
[03:28] fe016 | Oh yeah .
[03:28] mn005 | Yeah .
[03:28] me013 | And when he 's looking in the log domain he 's not really seeing it .
"[03:30] me013 | So . And when he 's looking in straight energy he is ,"
[03:33] me013 | so that 's a good place to start .
[03:34] mn005 | Yeah .
[03:35] me013 | Um .
[03:35] me013 | So that was that was the discussion we just had .
[03:37] me013 | Um .
[03:37] me013 | The other thing
[03:38] me013 | Actually we ca had a question for Adam in this .
"[03:41] me013 | Uh , when you did the"
[03:42] me013 | sampling ?
[03:47] me013 | the individual channels in order to do the e
"[03:49] me013 | uh the amplitude equalization ,"
[03:51] me013 | did you do it over
[03:53] me013 | just the entire everything in the mike channels ? You didn't try to find speech ?
"[03:56] me011 | No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel"
[03:59] me011 | um sampled ten minutes randomly .
"[04:02] me013 | Right , OK . So then that means that someone who didn't speak"
[04:05] me013 | would be largely represented by silence .
[04:06] me011 | Yep .
[04:09] me013 | So the normalization factor
[04:11] me013 | probably is i i i
"[04:12] me011 | Yeah , this was quite quick and dirty , and it was just for listening ."
[04:13] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:14] me013 | Yeah .
[04:16] me013 | OK .
[04:16] me011 | And for listening it seems to work really well .
[04:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:18] me013 | Yeah .
[04:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:19] me011 | So .
[04:19] me013 | Yeah .
[04:21] me013 | Right . So th
[04:22] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:24] me013 | OK .
[04:26] me013 | There 's a good chance then given that
[04:29] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:30] me013 | there there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm normalization with some
[04:30] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:32] mn005 | Mmm .
"[04:33] me011 | Yes , absolutely ."
[04:33] me013 | if we can figure out a way to do it .
[04:34] mn005 | Yeah .
[04:35] me013 | Uh . But
[04:39] me013 | s stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth .
[04:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[04:49] me013 | Uh , I think uh Liz has a very good point ,"
[04:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[04:55] me013 | Well , actually , you do have some distributions here ,"
[04:57] me013 | uh for these cases .
[04:57] mn005 | Yeah .
"[04:58] me013 | You have some histograms ,"
[05:00] mn005 | Yeah .
"[05:00] me013 | um and uh ,"
[05:02] me013 | they don't look very separate .
[05:05] mn005 | This is the the first derivate of log of frame energy
[05:07] me013 | Yeah .
[05:09] me013 | Yeah .
[05:09] mn005 | uh without any kind of normalization .
[05:11] me013 | Yeah .
[05:12] fe016 | Log energy .
[05:13] mn005 | These the
[05:13] fe016 | Sorry .
[05:14] mn005 | These are the the first experiments uh with comment uh
[05:18] me011 | it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized .
[05:21] me011 | It 's just number of frames .
[05:21] fe016 | Yeah .
[05:22] me013 | Yeah .
[05:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[05:23] fe016 | Yeah .
"[05:24] me011 | But yeah , even so ."
[05:24] fe016 | W
"[05:29] fe016 | measures , like raw energy or whatever ,"
[05:32] fe016 | maybe
"[05:35] fe016 | we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution 's shape ,"
"[05:43] fe016 | the mean , or what y"
[05:46] me013 | Yeah . But And so in in these he 's got
[05:46] fe016 | Yeah .
[05:47] me013 | that .
[05:48] me013 | He 's got some pictures .
[05:49] mn005 | Yeah .
[05:51] me013 | he i
"[05:51] me013 | just in derivatives ,"
[05:53] fe016 | Oh .
[05:53] me013 | but he d
[05:56] me013 | But he didn't h have it for the energy .
[05:57] fe016 | For the raw .
[05:57] me013 | He had it for the derivatives .
[05:58] fe016 | Yeah .
[05:58] fe016 | So .
[05:58] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:59] fe016 | I mean , there might be something there . I don't know ."
[06:02] fe016 | Huh .
[06:02] me013 | Yeah .
[06:05] mn005 | Here I I
[06:06] me013 | Oh that yeah that 's a good q
[06:09] me013 | just the l
[06:11] me013 | the
[06:11] me013 | unnormalized
[06:13] mn005 | No
[06:13] me013 | log energy ?
[06:14] mn005 | I I I haven't the result
[06:15] mn005 | but it 's the it 's the the the following .
[06:19] mn005 | Huh ?
"[06:20] me013 | That 's uh cuz I 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's right , I mean , even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at a single feature"
[06:26] mn005 | Yeah .
"[06:27] me013 | uh ,"
"[06:27] me013 | looking at the distribution , is a good thing to do ."
[06:30] mn005 | Catal - uh Combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters .
[06:34] mn005 | I I I I mean the the the scatter plot
"[06:43] me013 | is , which is right , is le"
"[06:45] me013 | I mean , let 's start with the Before we get complicated ,"
"[06:48] me013 | let 's start with the most basic wh thing ,"
[06:49] me013 | which is we 're arguing
"[06:53] me013 | uh if you look at the energy ,"
"[06:55] me013 | that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually"
[07:01] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:02] me013 | That 's that sort of hypothesis . And the first way you 'd look at that ,"
[07:04] me013 | uh s
"[07:05] me013 | she 's , you know , absolutely right , is that you would"
"[07:07] me013 | just take a look at the distribution of those two things ,"
[07:09] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:09] me013 | much as you 've plotted them here ,"
[07:11] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:13] me013 | Well in this case you have three .
"[07:14] me013 | You have the silence , and that that 's fine ."
[07:15] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:16] me013 | So ,"
"[07:17] me013 | uh with three colors or three shades or whatever ,"
[07:19] me013 | just just look at those distributions .
[07:19] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:21] me013 | And then , given that as a base , you can see if that gets improved ,"
"[07:27] me013 | looking at regular energy ,"
"[07:30] me013 | you know , it 's harder to see with the log energy ,"
[07:33] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:33] me013 | um
[07:34] me013 | and uh
"[07:35] me013 | also these different normalizations ,"
[07:37] me013 | does a particular choice of normalization make it better ?
[07:40] me013 | But I had maybe made it too complicated
[07:41] me013 | by suggesting
"[07:43] me013 | early on , that you look at scatter plots because that 's looking at a distribution in two dimensions ."
"[07:47] me013 | Let 's start off just in one ,"
[07:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:49] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:49] me013 | uh , with this feature ."
[07:51] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:51] me013 | I think that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated ."
[07:54] fe016 | Yeah .
[07:54] me013 | Um
[07:54] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:55] me013 | And then we w I think we 're agreed that
"[07:56] mn005 | I agree , yeah ."
[07:57] me013 | pitch - related things are are are going to be a a really likely candidate
[08:01] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[08:02] me013 | to help .
[08:03] mn005 | OK .
[08:05] me013 | uh your intuition
"[08:06] me013 | from looking at some of the data ,"
"[08:07] me013 | is that when you looked at the regular energy ,"
"[08:10] me013 | that it did in fact usually go up ,"
[08:12] mn005 | Yeah .
[08:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:14] mn005 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[08:14] me013 | that 's eh
"[08:15] me013 | you know , you should be able to come up with a measure which will"
"[08:19] me013 | And she 's right ,"
"[08:22] me013 | having this table , with a whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and so forth ,"
[08:24] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[08:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[08:28] me013 | the same kind of picture you have here .
"[08:30] mn005 | It it 's curious but uh I f I found it in the in the mixed file ,"
[08:35] mn005 | in one channel
[08:42] mn005 | talking alone
[08:43] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:43] mn005 | with a high level of energy
[08:45] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:46] mn005 | eh
[08:46] mn005 | in the middle eh a zone of overlapping
[08:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:50] mn005 | with
[08:51] mn005 | mmm less energy
[08:53] mn005 | and
[08:54] mn005 | eh come with another speaker with high energy and the
[08:58] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:58] mn005 | overlapping zone
[08:59] mn005 | has
[08:59] mn005 | eh less energy .
[09:02] me013 | Yeah .
[09:03] mn005 | Because there reach very many @ @
[09:05] fe016 | Right .
"[09:08] me013 | I w want to point to visual things ,"
[09:11] me013 | There 'll be overlap
"[09:12] me013 | between the distributions ,"
"[09:13] me013 | but the question is ,"
[09:13] mn005 | Yeah .
"[09:14] me013 | "" If it 's a reasonable feature at all ,"
"[09:16] me013 | there 's some separation . """
[09:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:18] fe016 | Especially
[09:19] fe016 | locally .
[09:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:21] fe016 | So . Locally . And the other thing is I
"[09:21] mn005 | just locally , yeah ."
[09:25] me011 | right now we 're just exploring .
[09:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:31] me011 | discriminative system .
[09:32] me013 | Yeah .
[09:33] me011 | And so even if if one of the features
"[09:36] me011 | does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap ."
[09:37] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:39] mn005 | Yeah .
"[09:41] me013 | the reason I had suggested the scatter f p features is I used to do this a lot ,"
[09:44] me013 | when we had
[09:45] me013 | thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at .
[09:48] me013 | um
[09:49] me013 | Because something is a good feature
"[09:51] me013 | uh by itself ,"
[09:56] me013 | as many together at the same time as possible
[10:04] me013 | funny way .
[10:05] me013 | But it 's true
[10:06] me013 | that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know
[10:08] me013 | that
[10:10] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:11] fe016 | Well , especially for normalizing . I mean ,"
[10:11] me013 | some hope
[10:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[10:14] fe016 | it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .
[10:18] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[10:19] fe016 | And it may not be the same
[10:21] fe016 | for all the types of overlaps or
[10:24] fe016 | the windows may not be
[10:26] fe016 | the same .
[10:29] fe016 | right now
"[10:32] fe016 | all of the speech ,"
"[10:34] fe016 | from the whole meeting ,"
"[10:35] fe016 | and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,"
"[10:37] fe016 | but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker , right ?"
[10:40] me013 | Right .
[10:40] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:41] fe016 | So I mean another way would just be to take
"[10:44] fe016 | the speech from just , say , Morgan ,"
"[10:46] fe016 | And just Jane and then just their overlaps ,"
"[10:49] fe016 | but by hand , by cheating ,"
[10:51] fe016 | and looking at
"[10:52] fe016 | you know , if you can detect something that way , because if we can't do it that way , there 's no"
[10:56] fe016 | good way that we 're going to be able to do it .
"[10:57] fe016 | That You know , there might be something"
[11:01] fe016 | helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .
[11:05] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:06] fe016 | Plus , I think it"
[11:07] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[11:10] fe016 | e
[11:10] fe016 | The m the right model will be easier to see that way .
"[11:13] fe016 | So if I don't know , if you go through and you find"
[11:16] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:16] fe016 | Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech and just"
[11:21] fe016 | sort of look at those
[11:23] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:27] fe016 | and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear"
[11:29] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:30] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[11:30] fe016 | pattern but we just can't
[11:32] fe016 | see it because there 's too many
[11:33] fe016 | combinations of of people
[11:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:36] fe016 | that can overlap .
[11:37] fe008 | I had the same intuition last last last week .
[11:38] fe016 | So .
[11:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:39] fe016 | Just seems sort of complex .
[11:40] fe008 | I think it 's to start with it 's s
"[11:42] fe008 | your your idea of simplifying ,"
[11:43] fe008 | starting with something that
[11:48] fe016 | Right .
"[11:50] fe016 | I don't think this is true , but what if"
[11:51] mn005 | To study individual ?
[11:53] fe016 | Hmm ?
"[11:53] fe008 | Sorry , what ?"
[11:53] mn005 | To study individual ?
"[11:55] fe016 | Well , to study the simplest case"
[11:57] fe008 | just simple case and
[11:58] fe008 | the one that has the lot of data associated with it .
[12:00] fe016 | Right .
[12:11] fe016 | both people talk more softly ? I don't think this happens at all .
[12:13] fe016 | Or they get louder .
"[12:15] fe008 | what if the equipment adjusts somehow ,"
[12:16] fe008 | there 's some
[12:16] fe008 | equalizing in there ?
[12:16] fe016 | Yeah
"[12:17] me013 | Uh ,"
[12:17] fe016 | I mean .
[12:17] me013 | no we don't have that .
[12:18] me013 | But .
[12:20] me011 | But I think that 's what I was saying about
[12:21] me011 | different types of
[12:21] fe008 | Saturation .
[12:21] me011 | overlap .
[12:23] fe016 | There are there are different
"[12:25] fe016 | types ,"
"[12:25] fe016 | and within those types ,"
"[12:27] fe016 | like as Jose was saying , that sounded like a backchannel overlap ,"
"[12:30] fe016 | meaning the kind that 's a friendly encouragement , like "" Mm - hmm . "" , "" Great ! "" , "" Yeah ! """
[12:34] mn005 | Yeah .
[12:35] fe016 | And it doesn't take you don't take the floor .
"[12:37] fe016 | Um , but ,"
"[12:38] fe016 | some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap ."
[12:43] mn005 | Yeah .
[12:43] fe016 | So .
"[12:46] fe016 | Actually the s new student , Don , who um Adam has met , and he was"
[12:51] fe016 | getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again
[12:58] fe016 | I don't know if he 's talked with you yet .
[12:59] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:00] mn005 | I don't consi
[13:01] mn005 | Now I don't consider that possibility .
[13:03] mn005 | This is a s a general studio of the overlapping
[13:06] me013 | Yeah .
[13:07] fe016 | So it might be something that we can
[13:10] mn005 | i
[13:12] me013 | I I would s
[13:12] me013 | actually still recommend that he do the overall thing
[13:16] me013 | because it would be the quickest thing for him to do .
"[13:18] me013 | He could You see , he already has all his stuff in place , he has the histogram mechanism ,"
[13:19] fe016 | Yeah .
[13:23] me013 | and all he has to do
[13:25] me013 | is change it uh
[13:26] me013 | uh from from log to plain energy
[13:28] me013 | and plot the histogram
[13:29] me013 | and look at it .
[13:30] me013 | And then he should go on and do the other stuff
[13:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[13:32] me013 | bec
[13:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[13:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[13:42] fe016 | So you don't have to worry about it . And here 's the three types of overlaps . And we 'll we 'll do the labelling for you .
[13:43] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:47] me013 | Hm - hmm .
[13:47] fe016 | Um .
[13:47] mn005 | Consider different class of overlap ?
"[13:49] fe016 | Yeah , that we would be working on anyway ."
[13:50] mn005 | If there 's time .
[13:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[13:56] mn005 | This is the thing I I comment with you before ,"
[13:58] mn005 | that uh we have a great variation of th situation of overlapping .
[14:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:02] mn005 | And the behavior for energy is ,"
"[14:04] mn005 | uh log energy ,"
[14:05] mn005 | is not uh the same all the time .
[14:08] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[14:09] me013 | But I guess I was just saying that that right now
[14:12] me013 | uh
"[14:13] me013 | from the means that you gave ,"
[14:15] me013 | I don't have any sense
[14:17] me013 | of whether
"[14:19] me013 | even ,"
"[14:19] me013 | you know , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct and I would imagine there should be"
[14:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[14:27] me013 | The distributions
[14:28] me013 | should be somewhat separated .
[14:31] me013 | Uh and
"[14:31] me013 | I I would still guess that if they are not separated at all ,"
[14:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[14:36] me013 | there 's there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it .
[14:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[14:39] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:40] me013 | Um ,"
[14:41] me013 | um
"[14:42] me013 | For instance , I mean I wouldn't expect that it was very common"
"[14:45] me013 | overall , that"
"[14:47] me013 | when two people were talking at the same time ,"
[14:49] me013 | that it would that it really was
"[14:51] me013 | lower , although sometimes , as you say , it would ."
[14:51] mn005 | Yeah .
[14:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:54] fe016 | Yeah , no , that was That was a jok"
[14:54] me013 | So .
[14:54] me013 | So .
"[14:56] fe016 | or a sort of ,"
[14:56] me013 | Yeah .
[14:57] fe016 | a case where where you would never know that unless you actually
[14:58] me013 | I mean . No . It could it probably does happen sometimes .
[14:59] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:01] fe016 | go and look at
[15:02] me013 | Yeah .
[15:02] me011 | Right .
[15:02] me013 | Yeah .
[15:03] fe016 | two individuals . So .
[15:03] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:03] me011 | Mind if I turned that light off ? The flickering is annoying me .
[15:06] me013 | OK .
"[15:07] fe016 | It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases ."
[15:13] fe016 | Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own
[15:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:20] fe016 | And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an "" mm - hmm "" . And the "" mm - hmm "" is really usually very low energy ."
[15:21] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:26] fe016 | So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy . But
[15:31] fe016 | and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot
"[15:33] fe016 | s in terms of their words or I mean , just listen to it . So ."
[15:35] mn005 | Yeah .
"[15:35] me013 | and and again what they what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log ,"
[15:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[15:43] me013 | Mmm ,"
[15:44] me013 | if i
[15:45] me011 | Tone
"[15:45] me013 | Well , it won't be as big ."
"[15:46] fe016 | I mean , even if you take the log , you can your model just has a more sensitive measures . So ."
[15:48] mn005 | Yeah .
"[15:49] me011 | Sure , but tone might be very"
"[15:52] me011 | Yeah , you 're "" mm - hmm "" tone is going to be very different ."
[15:52] fe016 | Yeah .
[15:53] fe016 | Right .
[15:55] fe016 | Right .
"[15:56] me011 | You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels ,"
[15:59] me011 | if you could if you had a good model for it .
"[16:02] me011 | Your "" mm - hmm "" detector ."
[16:02] me013 | If if you 're a
"[16:03] me013 | I guess my point is , if you 're doing essentially a linear separation , taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate ."
[16:09] me011 | Right .
[16:09] mn005 | Yeah .
"[16:10] me013 | So , uh if you i i"
[16:12] me013 | So i if there if there close to things it does
[16:13] fe016 | Yeah .
[16:15] me013 | it 's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction . If you 're doing a non if you 're doing some fancy thing then then yeah .
[16:20] me013 | And right now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and and saying we 're going to cut it here .
[16:25] me013 | Um
[16:26] me013 | and that that 's the indicator that we 're getting .
"[16:28] me013 | But anyway , yeah , we 're not disagreeing on any of this , we should look at it more uh more finely ,"
"[16:34] me013 | This often happens , you do fairly complicated things ,"
[16:37] me013 | and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .
[16:39] me013 | So
"[16:40] me013 | uh , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see ,"
"[16:44] me013 | and then , a a a as as Liz says , when they g have uh uh smaller um , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later ."
[16:47] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[16:52] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[16:53] me013 | between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved f from energy at all ."
[17:00] me013 | uh more pitch related stuff .
[17:01] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[17:02] mn005 | I I I think this is a good idea .
[17:04] me013 | OK .
[17:04] mn005 | Not consider the log
[17:04] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[17:05] mn005 | energy .
[17:05] me013 | Yeah .
[17:06] mn005 | @ @
[17:10] me013 | Pitch related ?
[17:11] me013 | Harmonicity and so on ?
[17:11] mn005 | I I 'm preparing the the program but I don't I don't begin
[17:14] mn005 | because eh
[17:14] me013 | Yeah .
[17:16] mn005 | I saw your email and
[17:17] me013 | Yeah .
[17:20] mn005 | I suppose it 's better to to consider the the energy this kind of parameter
"[17:25] me013 | Oh , that 's not what I meant ."
[17:25] mn005 | bef
"[17:28] me013 | I Well ,"
[17:30] me013 | I think that the harm
[17:32] me013 | I certainly wasn't saying this was better than the
[17:34] me013 | harmonicity and pitch related things I was just saying
[17:36] mn005 | I I go on with the with the
[17:37] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:38] mn005 | pitch , aha !"
[17:39] mn005 | I I I I understood uh that eh
[17:47] me013 | OK . OK .
"[17:49] me013 | OK . But I think , like , all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things , I think I would just sort of look at the energy and then"
[17:55] me013 | get into the harmonicity as as
[17:56] mn005 | OK . I go on
[17:57] me013 | a suggestion .
[17:58] mn005 | with the pitch .
[17:59] me013 | Uh
[18:01] me013 | OK . So maybe uh
[18:02] me013 | since w we 're trying to
"[18:03] me013 | uh compress the meeting ,"
"[18:05] me013 | um , I know Adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about"
[18:08] me013 | and did you have some ?
"[18:09] fe008 | I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic . So ,"
"[18:12] fe008 | when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers ,"
[18:17] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[18:17] fe008 | at the bottom of that I did have a proposal , and I had plan to go through with it , of of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s"
"[18:24] fe008 | just with reference to speaker style so ,"
[18:26] fe016 | Oh .
"[18:26] fe008 | you know , with reference and you know I said that on my in my summary , that"
[18:27] fe016 | That 'd be great .
"[18:28] fe016 | Yeah , I remem Right ."
[18:34] fe008 | but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in so
[18:39] fe008 | I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that .
[18:41] fe016 | That would be great . That would be really great .
[18:42] mn005 | Yeah .
"[18:42] fe008 | So ,"
[18:43] fe008 | but it you know it 's like
[18:43] me011 | Hmm .
[18:44] fe008 | it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction .
[18:53] fe016 | you know . So .
"[18:55] fe016 | It 's mostly that ,"
[19:01] fe016 | it would be much better if you can do it .
[19:03] fe016 | You 'd be much better at doing it also because
"[19:08] fe016 | I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out , and I really didn't wanna"
[19:15] fe008 | Well maybe we can OK .
"[19:15] me011 | It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting ,"
[19:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:18] me011 | but at some other time about what are the classes .
[19:18] fe016 | Yeah .
[19:21] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:22] fe016 | I think that 's a research effort in and of itself ,"
"[19:24] me011 | Yeah , it would be interesting ."
"[19:24] fe016 | because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll turn out and ,"
[19:25] mn005 | Yeah .
"[19:27] mn005 | I would think it 's interesting , yeah ."
"[19:28] fe016 | You know , it 's always an interesting question ."
"[19:28] fe008 | It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded ."
[19:30] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:31] fe016 | That 'd be great .
[19:32] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:32] me011 | Yep .
[19:33] fe016 | That 'd be really great . And we 'd still have some funding
[19:33] fe008 | OK .
[19:34] fe008 | I can do that .
[19:34] mn005 | uh uh
"[19:36] fe016 | for this project , like probably ,"
"[19:38] fe016 | if we had to hire some like an undergrad , because uh Don is being"
[19:39] mn005 | hhh .
[19:43] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:44] fe016 | I mean ,"
[19:45] fe016 | he we 're not paying him the full
[19:46] fe016 | RA - ship for all the time . So .
[19:49] fe016 | um
[19:50] fe016 | If we got it to where we wanted we needed someone to do that I don't think there 's really enough
[19:54] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:55] fe008 | Yeah , I see this as a prototype ,"
[19:55] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:56] fe016 | Yeah .
[19:57] fe008 | the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype .
[19:58] mn005 | I I think a a another
[20:00] mn005 | we can consider is eh the duration .
[20:03] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[20:04] mn005 | Another e e m
"[20:04] mn005 | besides eh the the class of overlap ,"
[20:07] mn005 | the duration .
[20:08] mn005 | Because is possible eh some s s um eh
"[20:13] mn005 | a type of a duration , eh ,"
[20:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[20:19] fe008 | It may be correlated .
[20:21] mn005 | Is possible
[20:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[20:22] mn005 | to have .
"[20:23] mn005 | And it 's interesting ,"
"[20:31] mn005 | Eh because eh if we have a type of ,"
"[20:35] mn005 | overlap , eh"
"[20:36] mn005 | backchannel overlap ,"
"[20:38] mn005 | with a short duration ,"
[20:40] mn005 | is possible
[20:44] mn005 | eh consider only the the eh window
[20:50] mn005 | side on the right side
[20:51] mn005 | overlapping with a a very
[20:57] mn005 | eh the if the fit of normalization is eh
[21:01] mn005 | mmm
[21:02] mn005 | bigger
[21:03] mn005 | eh in that overlapping zone eh very short
"[21:07] fe016 | Yeah , that 's true . The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel ."
[21:09] mn005 | I I me
[21:10] mn005 | I I understand .
[21:11] mn005 | I mean that you have
"[21:13] mn005 | eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh you have a overlapping zone"
[21:16] mn005 | very short
[21:17] mn005 | and you consider
[21:19] mn005 | eh n eh
[21:21] mn005 | all the channel
[21:21] mn005 | to normalize
[21:22] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:25] mn005 | for example "" mmm mm - hmm hmm """
[21:27] mn005 | eh
[21:28] mn005 | And the energy is not eh height
[21:31] mn005 | eh I think if you consider all the channel
[21:33] mn005 | to normalize and the channel is
[21:36] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:36] mn005 | eh eh eh
[21:38] mn005 | compared with the with the overlapping
"[21:41] mn005 | eh duration ,"
[21:43] mn005 | is
[21:44] mn005 | mmm
[21:46] mn005 | that
[21:47] mn005 | I I mean the the e effect of the normalization
[21:50] mn005 | eh with the mean and the and the variance
[21:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:52] mn005 | eh is different that if you consider
[21:56] mn005 | compared
[21:57] mn005 | eh with the n the duration of overlapping .
[22:01] me013 | You you want it
[22:03] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:04] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:05] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:06] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[22:06] me013 | but uh
[22:06] mn005 | I I don't know . Is s
[22:07] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:08] fe016 | Well it 's a sliding window , right ? So if you take the the measure"
[22:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:11] fe016 | in the center of the overlapped piece ,"
[22:11] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[22:13] fe016 | you know , there 'd better be some"
"[22:18] mn005 | Yeah ,"
"[22:20] mn005 | This is the the idea ,"
[22:23] fe016 | Yeah . So .
[22:25] mn005 | near the the overlapping zone .
[22:32] fe016 | as your backchannel .
[22:32] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:32] fe016 | Then you 're gonna w have a wash .
[22:33] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[22:34] fe016 | And hopefully it 's more like
[22:35] me013 | I 'm not sure that 's necessarily true .
[22:36] mn005 | Yeah ?
"[22:37] fe008 | It is an empirical question , it seems like ."
[22:38] fe016 | Yea -
[22:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:39] me013 | because
[22:39] fe008 | Yeah .
[22:40] me013 | um
"[22:41] me013 | again if you 're just compensating for the gain ,"
"[22:43] me013 | you know , the fact that this this gain thing was crude ,"
[22:46] me013 | and the gain wh
[22:47] me013 | if someone is speaking relatively
"[22:48] me013 | at consistent level ,"
"[22:50] me013 | just to to give a an extreme example ,"
[22:52] me013 | all you 're doing is compensating for that .
[22:55] me013 | And then you still s
"[22:55] me013 | And then if you look at the frame with respect to that ,"
[22:58] me013 | it still should should uh
[23:00] me013 | change
"[23:02] fe016 | Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across . I mean . That 's something we don't know ."
[23:05] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:07] fe008 | It 's possible to try it both ways , isn't it ?"
"[23:07] me011 | Well , I mean we 're also talking about"
[23:08] fe008 | in this small @ @
"[23:09] me011 | a couple of different things . I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing ."
[23:14] fe016 | Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window .
[23:16] me011 | And they could be quite different .
[23:17] fe016 | Yeah .
[23:17] me013 | Right .
[23:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[23:19] fe016 | Yeah . That 's true .
[23:19] me011 | Yep .
[23:19] me013 | where we were last week .
[23:20] fe016 | Yeah .
"[23:20] me013 | But , anyway"
[23:21] me013 | We we 'll have to look at some core things .
[23:22] fe016 | Um .
[23:22] mn005 | OK .
[23:22] fe008 | OK .
[23:25] fe008 | Great .
[23:25] fe016 | um .
[23:25] fe008 | OK .
[23:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[23:26] fe016 | But
"[23:26] fe016 | it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks ,"
[23:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:29] fe016 | and I was assuming that will be inherited because ,"
"[23:31] fe008 | Yep , I agree ."
[23:32] fe016 | if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time
[23:34] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[23:35] fe016 | via
"[23:36] fe016 | forced alignment or whatever we end up using ,"
[23:38] fe016 | then
"[23:39] fe016 | you know , this student and I would be looking at the time"
[23:42] fe016 | marks and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels
[23:44] mn005 | Yeah .
[23:46] fe016 | Jane gave
[23:47] fe008 | I wasn't planning to label the time marks .
[23:49] mn005 | I can give you
"[23:49] fe008 | I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side , yeah ."
"[23:50] mn005 | my transcription file , no ?"
[23:50] fe016 | @ @
[23:50] fe016 | I don't think you need to .
"[23:52] fe016 | Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow , right ?"
[23:55] fe008 | There you go .
[23:56] me011 | Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment . So .
[23:57] fe016 | Not now .
[24:00] me011 | Um
[24:01] me011 | If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times .
"[24:01] fe016 | Well , it 's something that w"
[24:04] mn005 | Yes
[24:08] fe016 | once he gets going we 're gonna
[24:10] fe016 | hafta come up with one and
[24:11] me013 | Yes .
[24:12] fe016 | Yeah .
[24:12] fe008 | Good .
[24:12] me011 | I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News .
[24:13] fe016 | So whatever you would label would be
[24:13] fe008 | Good .
"[24:15] fe016 | attached to the words , I think ."
[24:16] fe008 | Great !
"[24:16] fe008 | Good , good . Mm - hmm ."
[24:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[24:17] me013 | Well again for the close mike
"[24:19] me013 | stuff ,"
[24:20] me011 | That might be good enough .
[24:21] me013 | take a s
[24:21] me013 | take the Switchboard
[24:23] me011 | Yeah .
[24:25] me013 | Um
[24:26] me011 | It 'd be worth a try . It would be interesting to see what we get .
"[24:29] fe016 | Cuz there 's there 's a lot of work you can't do without that , I mean ,"
[24:32] me013 | Yeah .
[24:33] fe016 | You 'd have to go in and measure every
[24:34] fe016 | start and stop point
[24:36] fe016 | next to a word
[24:37] fe016 | is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words . So .
[24:37] fe008 | It would be very inefficient .
[24:37] me011 | Yep .
[24:39] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[24:39] fe016 | Anyway So that 'd be great .
[24:41] fe008 | Good . OK .
[24:42] mn005 | Yeah .
[24:43] me013 | There 's something we should
[24:45] me013 | talk about later but
[24:46] me013 | maybe not just now .
"[24:48] me013 | But , uh ,"
[24:50] me013 | should talk about our options as far as the uh
[24:54] me013 | transcription
"[24:57] me013 | But . Well , w"
[24:58] fe008 | OK . Good .
[24:58] me013 | But
[24:59] me013 | we 'll do that later .
[25:00] fe016 | Are we supposed to keep recording here ?
[25:00] fe008 | Yeah . Let 's do that later .
[25:01] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:01] me011 | Yeah Right .
[25:04] me013 | We 'll talk about it later .
[25:04] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:06] me013 | uh
"[25:07] me013 | Uh "" forms "" . You had something on forms ."
[25:09] me011 | Forms
[25:11] me011 | Next iteration of forms .
"[25:12] fe008 | Oh ! Oh good , OK ."
[25:15] me013 | Um .
[25:16] me013 | Oh .
[25:18] fe008 | How So it 's two pages per person ?
[25:19] me011 | Nope .
"[25:20] me011 | One 's a digit form , one 's a speaker form ."
[25:22] fe008 | Oh !
[25:23] me011 | So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits .
"[25:23] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[25:25] mn005 | Oh it 's the same .
[25:25] mn005 | Oh no no . Is is new Is OK .
[25:27] me011 | So don't fill these out .
[25:29] fe008 | Alright .
[25:29] me011 | This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like .
"[25:34] me011 | So , they incorporate the changes that we talked about ."
[25:41] fe008 | Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ?
[25:44] me011 | On which one ?
"[25:45] fe008 | On on the new one , Time comes first and then Date ,"
[25:49] me011 | Oh you mean on the digit form ?
"[25:51] me011 | Uh , because"
[25:53] fe008 | but it used used to be Date came first .
[25:53] me011 | the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest .
[25:57] fe008 | Oh I see .
"[25:58] me011 | So it was intentional . It 's an interesting observation , but it was intentional ."
[26:00] fe008 | How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ?
[26:03] me011 | Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time
"[26:06] me011 | and , excuse me , the time is when you actually read the digits ,"
[26:09] me011 | but I 'm filling out the date beforehand . If you look at the form in front of you ?
[26:12] fe008 | Yeah .
[26:12] me011 | that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ?
[26:14] me011 | you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time .
[26:20] fe008 | time of the meeting .
"[26:21] mn005 | Yeah ,"
"[26:21] me011 | Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms ."
[26:21] mn005 | I yeah .
"[26:23] me011 | The the reason I put the time in , is so that the person"
[26:24] fe016 | @ @
[26:25] mn005 | Me too .
"[26:25] me011 | who 's extracting the digits , meaning me ,"
[26:28] mn005 | Oh !
"[26:28] me011 | will know where to look in the meeting ,"
[26:30] me011 | to try to find the digits .
[26:30] fe008 | we 've been messing up your forms .
[26:32] me011 | I know .
[26:32] mn005 | I am put I am putting the beginning of the meeting .
"[26:33] fe016 | So you should call it , like , "" digits start time "" . Or ."
[26:33] me011 | And I haven't said anything .
[26:35] me011 | Yep .
[26:35] mn005 | in on there .
[26:36] me013 | Why What what were you putting in ?
"[26:38] fe008 | Oh , well , I was saying if we started the meeting at"
[26:39] mn005 | Yeah .
"[26:39] fe008 | two thirty , I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d"
"[26:41] fe008 | e everyone was putting two thirty , and"
[26:41] me013 | Oh .
[26:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[26:42] fe008 | I didn't realize there was "" uh oh"
"[26:43] me011 | No , it 's about fifty fifty ."
"[26:44] me011 | Actually it 's about one third each . About one third of them are blank , about one third of them are when the digits are read , and about one third of them are when the meeting starts ."
[26:52] mn005 | Oh .
[26:52] me011 | So .
[26:54] me011 | I could put instructions ?
[26:55] fe008 | Ei - either that or maybe you could
[26:55] me011 | Nah .
[26:56] mn005 | Yeah .
[26:59] fe008 | start reading digits on that particular session .
"[26:59] me011 | But if I 'm not at the meeting , I can't do that ."
"[27:02] me013 | Yeah , he 's been setting stuff up and going away . So ."
[27:04] fe008 | I see . Good point good point .
"[27:06] me011 | Yep , but that is the reason Name , Email and Time are where they are ."
"[27:06] fe008 | Oh , OK . Alright ."
[27:06] me013 | Yeah .
[27:10] me011 | And then the others are later on .
[27:12] me013 | Uh - huh .
[27:12] fe008 | OK . w
[27:14] mn005 | And the Seat is this number ?
[27:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:21] fe016 | "" For official use only """
"[27:27] fe008 | Well that does raise another question , which is why is the "" Professional use only "" line not higher ?"
[27:31] fe008 | Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ?
[27:34] fe008 | Oh .
[27:35] me011 | What ?
[27:35] fe008 | Because we 're filling in other things .
[27:35] me013 | What ?
[27:38] fe008 | If y
"[27:39] fe008 | your your professional use , you 're gonna already have the date ,"
[27:42] fe008 | and the s
[27:43] me011 | What which form are you talking about ?
[27:45] fe008 | Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one .
[27:46] fe008 | This is the digit form .
[27:46] mn005 | Oh .
[27:48] mn005 | Yeah .
[27:48] me013 | Digit .
[27:48] me013 | Digit form .
[27:49] mn005 | Yeah .
"[27:49] me011 | The digit No , that 's alright . The digit form doesn't have a "" for official use only "" line ."
[27:49] fe008 | Sorry .
"[27:53] me011 | It just has a line ,"
[27:54] fe008 | That uh OK .
[27:57] fe008 | Sorry about that . Yeah .
"[27:57] me011 | So on the digits form ,"
[27:58] me011 | everything above the line is a fill - in form
[28:00] fe008 | Yeah .
[28:05] fe008 | OK .
"[28:06] fe008 | Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here , so you really wanted to start with this other form ."
"[28:11] me011 | You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to ."
[28:15] fe008 | So I was looking at the change first . So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it
"[28:19] fe008 | wi with reference to this . So the digit form , we had one already ."
[28:22] fe008 | Now the f the fields
[28:24] fe008 | are slightly different .
[28:26] me013 | So the main thing that the person fills out
[28:29] me013 | um is the name and email and
[28:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[28:32] me013 | time ?
[28:32] me011 | Right .
[28:33] me013 | You do the rest ?
[28:34] me011 | Yep .
[28:35] me011 | Just as uh as I have
[28:36] me013 | Right .
[28:36] me011 | for all the others .
"[28:37] fe008 | And there 's an addition of the native language ,"
[28:39] fe008 | which is a bit redundant .
[28:41] fe008 | This one has Native Language and this one does too .
"[28:43] me011 | That 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form not the new form ."
"[28:46] fe008 | Oh ! Thank you . Thank you , thank you . There we go ."
[28:47] mn005 | Yeah .
"[28:50] fe008 | OK , I see ."
[28:58] me011 | I picked those categories from TIMIT .
"[29:02] fe016 | Actually , the only way I know is from working with the database and having to figure it out ."
"[29:05] me011 | With TIMIT , yeah ?"
[29:05] mn005 | uh - huh .
[29:06] mn005 | What i
"[29:06] me011 | So , I was gonna ask wh"
[29:08] me011 | w
[29:11] fe016 | Well yeah .
[29:11] mn005 | Yeah .
[29:12] me011 | I mean . So so what accent are we speaking ?
[29:15] me011 | Western ?
[29:18] me013 | By definition ?
[29:18] mn005 | And for simple for for me ?
"[29:20] me013 | Well ,"
"[29:20] fe016 | Probably Western , yeah ."
[29:22] mn005 | Spanish ?
[29:23] mn005 | eh
[29:24] mn005 | The original
[29:25] mn005 | is the center of Spain and the
"[29:28] me011 | Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want ."
[29:35] mn005 | Because
"[29:36] mn005 | is different , the Span - uh"
[29:40] me011 | Sure .
[29:45] me011 | So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety .
[29:48] mn005 | Yeah .
"[29:49] me011 | You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , "" You know , these are great if you 're a linguist "" ."
[29:53] fe008 | Yeah .
[29:54] me011 | But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them .
[29:56] fe008 | Yeah .
[30:00] me013 | if you 're a TI or MIT from nineteen eighty - five .
[30:02] me011 | Yeah
[30:03] me013 | Yeah .
[30:03] me011 | So I guess my only question was if if you were a South Midland speaking
"[30:08] me011 | region , person ?"
[30:08] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[30:09] me011 | Would you know it ? Is that what you would call yourself ?
[30:13] fe016 | I don't know .
[30:14] me011 | Yeah .
[30:19] me013 | names different peop
[30:23] me013 | I would think
[30:29] me013 | I went to s
"[30:35] fe008 | No , that 's not bad ."
[30:36] fe016 | Because
[30:37] fe008 | Yeah .
"[30:37] fe016 | it takes less time , and it 's sort of cute there 's no figure ."
[30:41] me013 | Well .
[30:45] me013 | But
[30:45] me013 | what if you moved five times and and uh
"[30:47] fe008 | Well , I was thinking you could have ma multiple ones"
"[30:47] fe016 | No , but you 're categorized ."
"[30:49] fe008 | and then the amount of time so , roughly ."
"[30:51] fe008 | So . You could say ,"
"[30:54] me011 | Well ,"
"[30:54] fe008 | five years on the west coast "" or something or other ."
[30:56] me011 | We I think we don't want
[30:57] me011 | to get that level of detail
[30:59] me011 | at this form . I think that 's alright if we want to follow up .
[31:03] me011 | But .
[31:05] me013 | I guess we don't really know .
"[31:06] fe016 | As I said , I don't think there 's a huge benefit"
[31:11] fe016 | The problem is that
[31:12] fe016 | for some things it 's really
[31:13] fe016 | clear and usually listening to it
"[31:15] fe016 | you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent ,"
"[31:19] fe016 | well , I guess they have the NYC , but"
[31:21] fe016 | New England has a bunch of very different
[31:25] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[31:25] fe016 | and so does
[31:26] fe016 | um
"[31:28] me011 | Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT , and those are right from TIMIT ."
[31:28] fe016 | S So do other places .
[31:30] fe016 | Right . And so
[31:31] fe016 | these would be satisfying like
[31:32] me011 | So .
"[31:34] fe016 | a speech research community if we released the database ,"
"[31:38] fe016 | but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because"
[31:42] fe016 | um
[31:43] fe016 | I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard . This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard
[31:48] fe016 | regions or
[31:49] fe016 | very close . Yeah .
[31:51] fe016 | Um
[31:53] fe016 | And I don't know how they filled that out .
"[31:57] fe016 | Yeah , Midland is the one that 's"
[32:00] fe016 | difficult I guess .
[32:01] fe008 | I think a lot of people Yeah .
[32:02] fe016 | Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which
[32:06] fe016 | uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern .
"[32:08] me011 | Yeah , I certainly don't . I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak ."
"[32:11] me013 | Oh , what is Northern ?"
[32:12] me011 | Am I speaking
[32:14] me011 | Western ?
[32:16] me013 | Well and what and what 's Northern ?
[32:21] me011 | Northwest ?
[32:21] fe016 | Northwest
[32:22] mn005 | Yeah .
[32:24] fe016 | Yeah .
[32:29] me011 | I c
"[32:35] me011 | I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same ."
[32:36] fe016 | I don't know .
[32:38] me011 | our our dialects
[32:39] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[32:40] me011 | Or whatever you region are the same . But I don't know what it is .
[32:43] me011 | So .
[32:45] me011 | a techno - speak accent ?
"[32:46] fe016 | Yeah , you know ?"
[32:47] me011 | A a geek region ?
[32:49] fe016 | I mean I you can sort of identify it f
[32:53] fe016 | but but
[32:55] fe016 | maybe we could
[32:59] fe016 | See what people choose
"[33:04] fe008 | I 'm wondering about a question like , "" Where are you from mostly ? """
[33:09] me013 | But I I 'm s
[33:10] mn005 | Yeah .
"[33:10] me013 | I 'm now that you mentioned it though , I am really am confused by "" Northern "" ."
[33:13] fe008 | I agree .
"[33:13] me013 | I really am . I mean ,"
[33:13] fe008 | I agree .
[33:14] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:14] fe008 | I agree .
"[33:15] me013 | in New England , that 's North ."
[33:17] me013 | If you 're i if you 're
"[33:20] fe008 | Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north ."
[33:23] fe016 | That 's North Midland .
"[33:23] me013 | But that 's also North Midland , right ?"
[33:24] mn005 | Yeah .
"[33:25] fe008 | Oh , @ @ . OK ."
"[33:25] fe016 | Yeah . Of course , that 's very different from , like , Michigan ,"
"[33:28] me013 | and Oregon and Washington are are Western , but"
[33:28] mn005 | Mmm .
[33:31] me013 | they 're also Northern .
[33:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:33] me013 | uh , Idaho ?"
[33:35] fe016 | Well there are hardly any subjects from Idaho .
[33:36] me013 | Montana ?
[33:42] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:44] fe016 | Sorry .
[33:49] me011 | Yeah really .
[33:50] fe016 | We could ask where they 're from . Yeah . But -
"[33:51] fe008 | It 'd be pretty simple , yeah ."
[33:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:52] mn005 | If you put eh the state ?
[33:52] fe016 | We went back to that .
[33:54] fe008 | Where are you from mostly ?
[33:54] fe016 | We we went we went around this and then a lot of people
[33:56] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[33:59] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[34:00] fe016 | You know .
"[34:00] me011 | Well , I like the idea of asking "" what variety of English do you speak "" as opposed to where you 're from"
"[34:06] me011 | Because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , "" well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? """
[34:06] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:06] fe008 | Hmm ?
[34:10] fe016 | Right .
[34:11] fe016 | Right .
[34:12] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:12] me013 | Let 's Mm - hmm .
"[34:12] fe016 | I mean it gives us good information on where they 're from , but"
[34:17] me011 | I mean . So so I would say Germany
[34:20] me011 | You know am I speaking with German accent I don't think so .
[34:20] fe008 | Oh .
[34:22] fe016 | Right .
"[34:22] fe008 | Well , see , I 'm thinking "" Where are you from mostly """
"[34:24] me011 | Oh , OK yeah ."
"[34:25] fe008 | because , you know , then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it ."
[34:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:26] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:27] me011 | Yep .
[34:29] mn005 | Yeah .
"[34:29] me011 | Yeah , I guess I could try to put squeeze in a little map . I mean there 's not a lot of r of room"
"[34:35] me013 | I 'd say , uh ,"
"[34:36] me013 | "" Boston , New York City , the South and Regular "" ."
"[34:43] me011 | I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning ."
"[34:43] fe016 | Oh , I don't know ."
[34:43] fe008 | Yeah .
[34:48] fe016 | So let 's make it up .
"[34:49] fe016 | S I mean , who cares . Right ? We can make up our own So we can say "" Northwest "" ,"
"[34:53] fe016 | "" Rest of West "" or something ."
[34:55] fe016 | You know .
"[34:55] fe016 | "" West """
[34:56] fe016 | and
[34:57] me011 | Ye - hhh .
[34:59] me011 | I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do .
[34:59] fe016 | I mean .
"[35:01] fe016 | Yeah , exactly . That 's not really a region ."
"[35:02] me013 | "" Do you come from the Louisiana Purchase ? """
[35:03] mn005 | And usually here people here know what is their
"[35:04] fe016 | "" Northern "" ."
[35:05] me011 | @ @
[35:08] mn005 | kind of mmm
[35:09] mn005 | lang English language ?
[35:11] me011 | That that 's exactly what we 're arguing about . We don't know .
[35:11] mn005 | eh here
[35:13] mn005 | Is easy for people to know ?
[35:14] fe016 | It 's it 's harder in America
"[35:16] fe016 | anywhere else , basically ."
"[35:17] me011 | I mean some of them are very obvious . If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know ."
[35:22] mn005 | N m
[35:22] mn005 | Yeah .
"[35:23] fe008 | Yeah , or Boston ."
"[35:24] me011 | Or Boston , yeah ."
[35:25] mn005 | Or Boston ?
"[35:26] fe016 | And those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know ."
[35:26] me013 | Yeah .
[35:26] mn005 | Yeah .
"[35:30] fe008 | Yeah , they do ."
[35:30] fe016 | They know very well .
[35:31] fe008 | Yeah I agree I agree . I agree .
[35:31] fe016 | They know they don't speak the same as the
[35:33] me011 | But
[35:33] fe008 | And they 're proud of it .
[35:34] fe016 | day o
[35:34] fe008 | Yeah .
[35:35] me011 | is Boston New England ?
[35:35] fe008 | It 's identity thing .
[35:36] fe016 | And they 're glad to tell you .
[35:36] mn005 | @ @ style .
[35:37] fe016 | Well .
[35:40] mn005 | Oh .
[35:40] me011 | I guess that 's the problem with these categories .
"[35:42] fe008 | Well , we ca"
"[35:43] me013 | Well , Boston 's @ @ , too ."
[35:45] fe008 | something like char characterize your accent
"[35:45] fe016 | "" Characterize your accent if you can . """
"[35:47] fe008 | and and so I would say , "" I don't know "" ."
[35:48] fe016 | Yeah .
[35:54] fe016 | And that 's actually good .
[35:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[35:55] fe008 | or something , yeah ."
"[35:56] fe016 | I was I was thinking of something along that line because if you don't know ,"
[35:56] me013 | How -
[35:58] fe008 | Good .
"[36:00] fe016 | then ,"
"[36:01] fe016 | you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally inept or something ,"
[36:04] fe008 | Hmm .
"[36:04] fe016 | if somebody doesn't know , it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of"
"[36:05] me013 | Well ,"
"[36:08] me013 | I mean ,"
[36:08] fe016 | midwest
[36:08] fe008 | Hmm ?
[36:09] me013 | it wasn't that long ago that we had somebody here who was from Texas who was absolutely sure that he didn't have any accent left .
[36:09] fe016 | standard .
[36:15] me013 | And and had he had a
[36:16] me013 | pretty
"[36:17] me011 | OK , so . I propose , take out Northern"
[36:18] me013 | noticeable drawl .
"[36:21] me011 | add , don't know ."
"[36:22] fe008 | Oh . Yeah . I I would say more more sweepingly , "" how would you characterize your"
[36:23] mn005 | Yeah .
"[36:26] fe008 | accent ? """
[36:27] me011 | So you want to change the instructions also not just say region ?
"[36:31] fe008 | Well , I think this discussion has made me think that 's s something to consider ."
"[36:37] me011 | they 're going to answer the same way if you say , "" What 's variety of English do you speak ? Region . """
"[36:42] me011 | as if you say "" what variety of region region do you speak ?"
"[36:44] me011 | Please characterize your accent ? """
[36:45] me011 | They 're going to answer the same way .
[36:47] mn005 | Mmm .
"[36:52] me011 | Oh , I see ."
[36:53] me011 | Well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity .
"[36:57] fe008 | Yes , but if , as Liz is suggesting , people who have strong accents know"
"[37:03] me011 | I mean that 's what I had before , and you told me to list the regions to list them ."
"[37:05] fe008 | Well , I know ."
[37:06] me013 | Right .
[37:07] me013 | Right . Right .
[37:07] me011 | So .
[37:08] fe008 | That 's true .
"[37:08] me013 | Yeah last week last week I was sort of r arguing for having it wide open , but then everybody said "" Oh , no , but then it will be hard to interpret"
"[37:14] me013 | because some people will say Cincinnati and some will say Ohio "" . And ."
[37:15] me011 | I mean I had it wide open last week and and you said TIMIT .
[37:17] fe016 | What if we put in both ?
[37:17] fe008 | Yeah .
[37:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:19] me011 | That 's what the "" Other "" is for ."
"[37:21] fe016 | No , I mean what if we put in both ways of asking them ?"
"[37:23] fe016 | So . One is Region and the another one is "" if you had to characterize yourself your accent ,"
"[37:28] fe016 | what would you say ? """
[37:28] me011 | Won't they answer the same thing ?
[37:30] fe016 | Well they might only answer only one of the questions but
[37:33] fe016 | if
[37:33] fe008 | Yeah that 's fine .
[37:34] fe016 | You know .
"[37:34] fe008 | They might say "" Other "" for Region because they don't know what category to use"
[37:38] fe008 | because it is easier to have it open ended .
"[37:38] fe016 | And we we might learn from what they say , as to which one 's a better way to ask it ."
[37:43] fe016 | But I Cuz I really don't know .
[37:44] me013 | This is just a small thing but
[37:44] fe016 | @ @
[37:46] me013 | um
"[37:47] me013 | It says "" Variety "" and then it gives things that e have"
[37:49] me013 | American as one of the choices .
"[37:51] me013 | But then it says "" Region "" , but Region actually just applies to"
"[37:55] me013 | uh , US , right ?"
[37:55] me011 | Right .
"[37:57] me011 | I mean that 's why I put the "" Other "" in ."
"[37:58] fe008 | Well , we thought about it ."
"[37:59] me013 | Ah , OK ."
"[38:00] fe008 | Yeah , OK ."
"[38:00] fe008 | We just We sort of thought , "" yes , """
[38:01] me013 | S
"[38:02] fe008 | At the last meeting , my recollection was that"
[38:06] fe008 | uh
[38:08] fe008 | that that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different
[38:13] fe008 | language groups and that it 's a
[38:14] me011 | Yep .
[38:17] fe008 | of space .
[38:18] me013 | OK .
"[38:19] me011 | So I mean , I I mean the way I had it last time was Region was blank , it just said Region colon ."
[38:19] fe008 | That 's what I thought .
[38:24] fe008 | Yeah .
[38:24] fe008 | Yeah .
"[38:25] me011 | And and I think that that 's the best way to do it ,"
[38:32] fe016 | Maybe we can make the list a little smaller .
"[38:34] me011 | Well , certainly dropping "" Northern "" I think is right , because none of us know what that is ."
"[38:38] fe016 | And keeping "" Other "" ,"
"[38:40] fe016 | and then maybe this North Midland , we call it "" North Midwest "" ."
[38:45] fe016 | South Midwest .
[38:46] fe016 | Does that make sense ?
[38:46] me013 | I I think so . Yeah .
[38:46] mn005 | South Midwest ?
"[38:48] me013 | U unless you 're from Midland , Kansas . But . Yeah ."
"[38:54] me011 | Is "" Midwest "" one word ?"
"[38:55] me013 | Midland Midland , Texas or Midland , Kansas ? I forget ."
"[38:57] fe016 | Y yeah , one w"
[38:58] me013 | But there 's a town .
[38:59] fe016 | Oh .
[38:59] me013 | in in there . I forget what it is @ @ .
[39:01] fe008 | I don't think that 's what they mean .
"[39:02] fe016 | But , yeah . So . Kansas would be South Midland . Right ?"
[39:02] me013 | Yeah .
[39:05] me013 | Y yeah .
[39:06] fe016 | And and wouldn't Yeah .
"[39:07] fe016 | So , th"
"[39:07] me013 | And Colorado , right across the border , would be"
"[39:08] fe016 | I 'm from Kansas ,"
[39:09] fe016 | actually .
[39:10] me013 | North Midland .
[39:11] fe016 | Yeah .
"[39:14] fe016 | the dropping North , so it would be"
[39:16] fe016 | Western . It 's just one big
"[39:19] fe016 | shebang ,"
"[39:22] me013 | But you do in the others , too . So ."
[39:22] me011 | But that 's true of New England too .
[39:23] fe016 | but so do you Yeah .
[39:24] me013 | Yeah .
[39:24] fe016 | Yeah .
[39:25] fe016 | Yeah .
"[39:26] me011 | Well , I shouldn't say that . I have no clue . I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City . But I have no idea whether it does or not ."
[39:32] fe008 | It does seem I mean . I I would
[39:32] me013 | U
[39:35] fe008 | w
[39:35] fe008 | would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself .
"[39:39] me011 | I think that that was what happened with TIMIT ,"
[39:42] fe008 | OK .
[39:42] me011 | was that it was an analyst .
"[39:43] fe016 | Yeah , I don't know how it came from ."
[39:44] fe008 | OK .
[39:44] me013 | Where Where 's where does uh
[39:46] me013 | New New York west of west of uh New York City
[39:50] me013 | uh
[39:51] me013 | and uh
[39:52] fe016 | So . That 's New England I think . Yeah .
[39:53] me011 | New England
[39:53] me013 | N
"[39:54] me013 | No , it 's not ."
[39:56] me013 | Oh no .
[39:56] fe008 | I sort of thought they were part of the one of the Midlands .
"[39:59] me011 | "" Other "" , it goes under "" Other "" , definitely under "" Other "" ."
[40:04] me013 | Pennsylvania Yeah . Pennsylvania is not New England .
[40:06] me013 | and uh New Jersey is not New England and Maryland is not New England and none of those are the South .
[40:09] me011 | OK . So .
[40:10] me011 | Another suggestion .
[40:12] fe008 | Yeah .
"[40:12] me011 | Rather than have circle fill in forms ,"
"[40:14] me011 | say "" Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . """
[40:19] fe008 | OK .
[40:20] fe016 | OK !
[40:21] me013 | That 's good .
[40:21] mn005 | Yeah .
"[40:21] fe008 | Fine by me , fine by me ."
[40:21] fe016 | Sure !
[40:22] me013 | I like that .
[40:22] fe008 | Yeah .
[40:23] fe016 | Let 's just And we 'll see what we get .
[40:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:23] me013 | We 're all sufficiently tired of this
[40:24] fe008 | Be easier on the subjects .
[40:26] me013 | that we 're agreeing with you .
[40:26] fe008 | I think that 's fine .
[40:28] fe008 | I like that . I like that .
[40:28] me013 | You like it ?
[40:29] me013 | OK .
"[40:29] fe008 | Yeah , I do ."
[40:29] me013 | Good .
"[40:30] me011 | Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well ."
"[40:33] me011 | Southern , Cockney ?"
[40:36] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:37] me011 | Is that a real accent ?
"[40:38] fe008 | Sure , yeah !"
[40:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:39] me011 | How do you spell it ?
[40:39] fe008 | I think that 's fine .
[40:40] me013 | Cockney ?
[40:42] me011 | N E Y ?
[40:42] me013 | Yeah .
[40:45] me013 | Liverpuddlian .
[40:46] fe008 | Yeah .
[40:46] fe008 | Alright .
"[40:49] me011 | OK , we 'll do it that way . Actually , I like that a lot ."
[40:52] me013 | OK .
"[40:52] me011 | Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do ,"
"[40:54] me011 | the granularity ,"
[40:55] me011 | and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are .
[40:59] fe008 | That 's right .
[40:59] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:59] me013 | OK .
[41:00] fe008 | And it 's easy on the subjects .
[41:01] me011 | Yep .
[41:01] fe008 | Now I have one suggestion on the next section .
[41:01] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[41:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:03] fe008 | So you have native language , you have region ,"
[41:05] fe008 | and then you have time spent in English speaking country .
"[41:08] fe008 | Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying "" which one"
[41:22] me013 | Yes .
"[41:23] fe008 | It doesn't have to be ex all at all exact , just in the same open field"
[41:27] fe008 | format that you have .
"[41:27] me011 | Yep , just which one . I think that 's fine ."
[41:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[41:29] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:30] fe008 | "" which one"
[41:35] me013 | OK .
[41:40] me013 | We done ?
[41:40] me011 | Yep .
"[41:41] fe008 | Yeah , that 's good ."
[41:41] me013 | OK .
[41:42] me013 | um
[41:43] me013 | s e
[41:43] me013 | Any any other
[41:45] me013 | uh open mike topics or should we go right to the digits ?
"[41:48] me011 | Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ?"
[41:52] me011 | OK .
[41:52] fe008 | Isn't that wonderful ! Yeah .
[41:53] fe008 | Excellent ! Thank you !
[41:53] me011 | Yeah . So .
[41:54] fe016 | I 'm s
[41:54] me011 | So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels .
[41:54] fe016 | I ha It 's really great .
[41:58] me011 | But it 's hideously slow .
"[42:00] fe008 | So you this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches ."
"[42:01] me011 | The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down ."
[42:02] fe016 | M
[42:05] fe008 | Fantastic !
[42:06] me011 | Just uses a lot of memory .
"[42:10] me011 | No , the the one that 's installed is fine . It 's not slow at all ."
[42:13] me011 | I wrote another version .
"[42:15] me011 | Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view ,"
[42:18] me011 | It has multiple panes with the views .
[42:19] mn005 | Yeah .
[42:20] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[42:20] me011 | But the problem with it
[42:21] me011 | is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow
[42:25] me011 | that every time you do anything it just crawls .
[42:27] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[42:28] me011 | It 's really bad .
"[42:28] fe016 | So , it it 's the redrawing of the w"
[42:29] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:30] fe016 | oh uh - huh ,"
[42:30] fe016 | w as you move .
"[42:32] me011 | As you play , as you move , as you scroll ."
"[42:34] me011 | Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable ."
[42:37] me011 | So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it .
"[42:41] fe008 | in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things ,"
[42:42] fe016 | Oh yeah .
[42:43] fe008 | that 'll be a big help .
[42:43] me011 | So .
[42:43] me011 | I think that the one Dan has is usable enough .
[42:46] me011 | It doesn't display the others . It displays just the mixed signal .
[42:49] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[42:50] me011 | But you can listen to any of them .
[42:52] fe008 | That 's excellent . He also has version control which is another nice
[42:53] mn005 | Yeah .
"[42:58] fe008 | Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches ."
[42:58] me011 | No .
[42:59] me011 | No .
[42:59] fe008 | Oh OK .
[43:00] fe008 | Well .
[43:00] fe008 | Alright .
[43:00] fe016 | So is there any hope for actually displaying
[43:03] fe016 | the wave form ?
"[43:03] me011 | Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK"
[43:06] fe016 | OK .
[43:06] me011 | At least not if we 're going to use Snack .
"[43:12] fe008 | Well , or use the one that crawls ."
[43:12] fe016 | OK .
[43:18] fe016 | whatever 's there . And
[43:25] fe016 | I mean .
[43:30] fe016 | a feature stream .
"[43:32] fe016 | And it 's just , you know , a a"
[43:32] mn005 | Yeah .
"[43:33] fe016 | uni - dimensional feature ,"
[43:35] fe016 | varying in time .
"[43:37] fe016 | And we want to plot that , instead of the whole wave form ."
[43:39] me011 | I mean .
[43:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:39] fe016 | That might be faster . Right ? So .
[43:41] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:41] me011 | We we could do that but that would mean changing
[43:44] me011 | the code .
[43:45] me011 | I mean this isn't a program we wrote .
[43:45] me013 | Yeah .
"[43:46] me011 | This is a program that we got from someone else ,"
[43:48] me011 | and we 've done patches on .
[43:48] fe016 | OK .
[43:50] fe016 | OK .
[43:50] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[43:50] mn005 | Yeah .
"[43:50] fe016 | Well , I 'll talk to you about it and we can see but"
[43:50] me013 | Cou -
[43:50] me011 | So .
[43:51] me011 | Yeah .
[43:51] me013 | i e
"[43:52] me013 | I mean , y"
[43:55] me013 | Is there some way to have someone write
[43:58] me013 | patches
[44:02] me011 | Not easily . I mean y yes we could do that . You could you can write
[44:05] me011 | widgets in C .
[44:07] me013 | Yeah .
"[44:10] me011 | Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough ,"
"[44:13] me011 | we can do it otherwise . I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there ."
[44:18] me011 | And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream
[44:22] fe016 | OK .
[44:23] me011 | where things are happening .
[44:24] mn005 | Hmm ?
[44:24] me011 | So I I don't think it 'll be bad .
[44:25] fe008 | also the case that that uh this multi - wave thing
"[44:31] fe008 | So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people ,"
[44:34] fe008 | and it 's likely that uh So . And and
[44:36] fe008 | they responded favorably looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .
[44:37] fe016 | Oh .
[44:40] fe008 | They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel
[44:43] fe008 | uh stream one before was simply that
[44:47] fe008 | And uh
[44:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[44:51] fe008 | @ @ .
[44:51] me013 | They may well have not had much demand for it .
"[44:53] fe008 | Well that 's that 's that 's true , too ."
[44:54] me013 | Yeah .
[44:55] mn005 | Yeah .
[44:59] fe008 | Oh . No .
[44:59] me011 | Depends on how much work they did .
[44:59] fe008 | I just mean I just mean that it 's that that his So .
[45:00] mn005 | Oh .
[45:04] fe008 | we now have
[45:05] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[45:05] fe008 | does have the status of
[45:08] fe008 | l likely being incorporated into the central code .
[45:10] fe016 | OK .
"[45:10] fe008 | Now , tha Now , if we develop further"
"[45:15] me011 | I think if if if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough"
[45:17] fe008 | set that way .
[45:20] me011 | I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it .
[45:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[45:22] me011 | But it 's not a trivial task .
[45:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[45:27] fe008 | I just like the idea of it being something that 's ,"
"[45:29] fe008 | you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it ."
[45:29] me011 | Yeah .

[00:01] me006 | Hello ?
"[00:24] me013 | and uh I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner ."
[00:34] me026 | Huh .
"[00:40] me013 | as a good illustration ,"
"[00:41] me013 | uh , in fact it 's not ,"
[00:54] me013 | uh
[00:55] me013 | but
[00:59] me013 | So . And then we had this other discussion about um
"[01:09] me013 | you know , are we getting hurt there ? But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant"
"[01:21] me013 | So there was a question of whether we should change things here , whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that or whether we should"
"[01:29] me018 | Yeah , he suggested a smaller capacitor , right ? For the P D As ?"
"[01:31] me013 | Right . But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , uh , many other problems could ha happen ."
"[01:41] me013 | And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that , so ."
[01:45] me018 | Yeah .
"[01:46] me013 | A simple thing to do is he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail , but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested ."
[01:56] me013 | We just run over the data before we deal with it .
[01:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:59] me013 | um The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here ,"
[02:05] me013 | uh whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not .
[02:10] me013 | And
[02:11] me013 | I don't know if anybody knows . But .
[02:12] me006 | Um .
[02:14] me006 | I could go check .
"[02:19] me013 | um if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program ,"
[02:24] me013 | which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP
[02:28] me013 | um then
"[02:35] me013 | um allows you to do high - pass filtering and in general we like to do that , because of things like this and"
[02:42] me013 | it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe
"[02:44] me013 | filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies , even pretty low speech frequencies , at all , but it 's"
[02:54] me013 | Oh . I don't know I wrote this a while ago
[02:56] me018 | Is it like twenty ?
[02:57] me013 | Something like that . Yeah . I mean I think there 's some effect above twenty but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild .
[02:58] me018 | Yeah .
"[03:05] me013 | So , I mean it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild ."
[03:18] mn007 | Uh . I think we use a pre - emphasis . Yeah .
[03:23] me013 | So . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D A mike for .
[03:30] me013 | uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes so
"[03:36] me013 | we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other but if we do make use of the cheap mikes ,"
[03:41] me013 | uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we
[03:46] me013 | process it . And then again if it 's
"[03:48] me013 | uh depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of ."
[03:57] me013 | uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation .
[04:03] me013 | uh
[04:04] me018 | Did somebody notice it during your talk ?
[04:05] me013 | uh No .
[04:06] me018 | Huh .
[04:07] me013 | Well .
"[04:08] me013 | uh Well . If they made output they were they were , you know they were nice ."
"[04:16] me013 | since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match , but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get"
[04:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[04:28] me013 | uh It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do .
"[04:41] me013 | uh But . So it was it was a bad example in that way , but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance , so it wasn't"
[04:52] me013 | it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate . So .
"[04:56] me013 | So uh , but uh ,"
"[04:58] me013 | Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went "" oh , man . Why didn't I notice that ? """
[05:02] me018 | Hmm .
[05:04] me013 | um .
[05:05] me013 | So .
"[05:09] me013 | So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ ."
"[05:12] me013 | One of the things I was I mean , I was trying to think about what what 's the best"
"[05:15] me013 | way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts one was ,"
"[05:21] me013 | is O K , but the thing is"
[05:24] me013 | the eyes uh and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns
[05:30] me013 | from from noise
[05:32] me013 | that in first glance you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad
[05:36] me013 | uh because there 's many features that are still preserved .
[05:40] me013 | So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see
"[05:45] me013 | that something looks different , an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well . You know ."
[05:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[05:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[05:52] me013 | i i Some things are going to be hurt .
[05:55] me013 | um
"[05:56] me013 | Another , I was thinking of was um"
"[05:59] me013 | taking some spectral slices ,"
"[06:01] me013 | like uh like we look at with the recognizer ,"
"[06:05] me013 | and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there ,"
"[06:08] me013 | and the the uh , um ,"
[06:11] me013 | the reverberation uh does make it does change that . And so maybe maybe that would be more obvious .
[06:15] me018 | Hmm .
[06:18] me026 | Spectral slices ?
[06:19] me013 | Yeah .
[06:20] me026 | W w what d what do you mean ?
"[06:22] me013 | Well , I mean um"
[06:26] me018 | So like one instant in time .
[06:28] me026 | OK .
"[06:29] me013 | So it 's , yeah , at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something ,"
[06:34] me026 | OK .
[06:35] me013 | you have a spectrum or a cepstrum . That 's what I meant by a slice . Yeah . And
[06:37] me026 | I see .
[06:43] me018 | the uh some MFCC feature vectors .
"[06:46] me018 | You know , one from one , one from the other , and then , you know , you can look and see how different the numbers are ."
[06:55] me018 | I don't mean a graph . I mean the actual numbers .
[07:10] me018 | Yeah .
[07:12] me018 | It 's not the square .
[07:18] me013 | Uh . What else wh what 's what else is going on ?
[07:35] mn007 | the PDA 's there .
[07:36] me013 | Uh . I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it .
[07:39] mn007 | Yeah ?
"[07:47] mn007 | Well , anyway . Um ."
"[08:32] mn007 | very impressive . Well , there is no real improvement ."
"[08:37] me013 | But it 's not wer worse and it 's better better latency , right ?"
[08:42] mn007 | Yeah .
[08:43] mn007 | Yeah .
[09:07] me013 | Yeah .
[09:19] mn007 | But
"[09:19] mn007 | I don't think it indicates something , really ."
[09:25] me013 | Uh - huh .
[09:27] mn007 | It 's simply
[09:30] mn007 | Well .
[09:32] mn007 | Y
"[09:39] me013 | Right . So this was Italian , right ?"
[09:48] me013 | Uh - huh .
[09:49] mn007 | I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also .
"[09:57] mn007 | By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script ."
[10:01] me013 | Uh - huh .
[10:04] me013 | Yeah .
[10:06] me018 | Yeah . Yeah I looked at um looked at the results when Stephane did that and it 's it 's really wo really happens . I mean th the only difference is you change the self - loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate .
[10:07] mn007 | Well .
[10:22] me013 | A tenth of a per cent .
[10:24] mn007 | Even tenth of a percent ?
"[10:26] mn007 | Well , we tried we tried point one , yeah ."
"[10:26] me018 | I I 'm sorry f for point from You change at point one and n not tenth of a percent , one tenth , alright ? Um so from point five so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better ."
[10:29] mn007 | Hmm .
[10:31] me013 | Yeah .
[10:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[10:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:48] mn007 | Mmm , yeah ."
[10:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:03] me018 | Yeah . That 's supposed to be point six ,"
[11:03] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:04] me018 | for the self - loop .
[11:05] me013 | Point It 's supposed to be point six .
[11:06] me018 | Yeah .
"[11:07] me018 | But changing it to point five I think is which gives you much better results , but that 's not allowed ."
[11:13] me013 | But not allowed ? Yeah . OK .
[11:14] me018 | Yeah .
"[11:15] mn007 | Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will"
[11:18] mn007 | always give you the better results on other test set or it
[11:20] me018 | Yeah .
[11:25] mn007 | But .
[11:33] mn007 | is the fact that the mismatch
[11:35] mn007 | is trained
[11:36] mn007 | only on the far microphone .
[11:53] mn007 | it 's it 's clean speech basically
"[11:58] mn007 | and for the well - match , it 's a mix of"
[12:01] mn007 | close microphone and distant microphone and Well .
[12:05] mn007 | So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part .
[12:16] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[12:16] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[12:23] me018 | and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system .
[12:28] me013 | Hmm .
[12:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[12:34] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[12:34] me013 | Well . Yes . So . And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .
[12:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[12:59] me018 | it
[13:11] me018 | um with many more uh mixtures per state .
"[13:19] me013 | Yeah , easily four times as many parameters ."
[13:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[13:27] me018 | uh
[13:33] mn007 | Yeah .
"[13:33] me018 | The silence model expected duration was really different . And so in the case where um it had a better score , the silence model expected duration was much longer . So it was like it was a better match . I think you know if we"
[13:36] mn007 | Yeah .
[14:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[14:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[14:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[14:44] me013 | Right .
[14:54] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[14:59] me013 | Yeah .
[15:14] mn007 | Hmm .
"[15:18] me018 | And so . I 'll let you know what what happens with that . But if we can you know , run all of these back - ends f with many fewer iterations and on Linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done ."
[15:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[15:31] me018 | So .
"[15:52] me013 | But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency , right ?"
[15:59] mn007 | um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case
"[16:05] mn007 | and we just noticed that Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny . It 's not a mean of word error rate . It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate , it 's a weighted mean of improvements ."
[16:20] me013 | Uh - huh .
[16:29] mn007 | What happened is that if you have a small
[16:31] mn007 | improvement
[16:32] mn007 | or
[16:35] mn007 | it will have uh huge influence on the improvement
[16:45] mn007 | for the well - ma well - matched case also .
[16:48] me018 | So it it weights the improvement on the well - matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?
"[16:52] mn007 | No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement not of the error rate ."
[16:56] me018 | Yeah .
"[16:57] me018 | Yeah , and it 's hard to improve on the on the best case , cuz it 's already so good , right ?"
"[17:06] mn007 | HMK 's ,"
[17:08] mn007 | uh like
"[17:09] mn007 | five percent uh absolute ,"
[17:13] mn007 | and this will not affect the final score
[17:27] mn007 | Uh .
"[17:34] mn007 | Uh improvement ? No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate , yeah . Sorry ."
[17:39] me013 | OK . So if you have
[17:42] me013 | uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent .
[17:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[18:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:07] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:08] me013 | OK . But yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement .
[18:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:12] me013 | Word error rate .
[18:19] mn007 | it 's on absolute
"[18:22] mn007 | on on relative figures ,"
[18:23] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[18:24] mn007 | So when we look at this error rate
"[18:29] mn007 | Mmm , yeah ."
"[18:30] mn007 | Mmm , yeah ."
[18:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[18:38] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:45] me013 | Yeah but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different . If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent , five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference , but five over ten is is big ."
[18:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[18:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[18:59] me013 | So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important .
[19:01] me018 | I see . I see . Yeah .
[19:04] me018 | That makes sense .
[19:05] me013 | Um . Um .
[19:05] mn007 | Mmm .
[19:07] mn007 | Well anyway uh . So . Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match
[19:13] mn007 | and yeah .
[19:16] me013 | What 's a little bit ?
[19:35] me018 | I I 've been using that .
[19:37] me018 | OK .
"[19:39] me018 | Oh , it was . Oh , I shoul"
[19:39] me013 | Jeff updated it some years ago and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it . So .
"[19:48] me013 | Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall ."
[19:50] me018 | OK .
[19:52] mn007 | Right .
"[19:55] mn007 | So it 's around , like , point five ."
[20:06] me013 | Worse .
"[20:07] mn007 | Worse , yep ."
"[20:10] mn007 | Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four , and we go to ninety - four point O four ."
[20:17] mn007 | Uh .
"[20:18] me018 | Ninety - three point six four , right ? is the baseline ."
[20:31] me018 | Yeah .
[20:34] mn007 | My baseline is the submitted system .
"[20:38] me018 | Ah ! OK . Ah , ah ."
[20:38] mn007 | Hmm .
[20:39] me018 | Sorry .
[20:40] mn007 | Oh yeah .
"[20:41] mn007 | For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four ."
"[20:55] me013 | OK , so we are getting hurt somewhat . And is that wh what do you know what piece you 've done several changes here . Uh , do you know what pie"
[21:01] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:02] mn007 | I guess I guess it 's it 's the filter .
[21:04] mn007 | Because
"[21:06] mn007 | nnn ,"
"[21:12] mn007 | So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched ,"
"[21:30] me018 | If we saw that making a small change like , you know , a tenth , to the self - loop had a huge effect , can we really make any conclusions about"
[21:40] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:42] mn007 | Yeah that 's th
[21:43] mn007 | Yeah .
"[21:54] mn007 | So . There is first this thing , and then the yeah , I computed the um like , the confidence level on the different"
[22:08] mn007 | point six
[22:22] mn007 | So .
[22:26] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:26] me013 | Uh . Do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?
[22:27] mn007 | But .
[22:32] mn007 | Uh . About the same . It doesn't hurt . Yeah .
[22:38] mn007 | No .
[23:22] me013 | So I guess the question is if you can do better than this . If you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down .
[23:33] mn007 | Mmm .
[23:36] mn007 | Yeah .
"[23:50] mn007 | Well , we are"
[23:54] me013 | Yeah .
[23:57] mn007 | Um .
[24:03] mn007 | the um
[24:07] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[24:09] mn007 | Um .
[24:12] mn007 | Yeah . And so . Yeah . We are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction but
[24:24] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:46] mn007 | There is this Eurospeech deadline , so ."
[24:48] me013 | I see .
[24:54] mn007 | Yeah .
"[25:05] mn007 | But we 've not discussed it it it this yet , yeah ."
"[25:11] me013 | Yeah . Sounds like a great idea but but I think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline . But that 'll be uh , uh done in a week . So , maybe after this next one ."
[25:19] mn007 | Mmm .
[25:24] me018 | Wow ! Already a week ! Man ! You 're right . That 's amazing .
[25:32] mn007 | S
[25:40] mn007 | We are trying to to do something with the
"[25:43] mn007 | Meeting Recorder digits ,"
[25:45] me013 | Right .
"[25:50] mn007 | And the good thing is that there is this first deadline ,"
[25:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[25:54] mn007 | and , well , some people from OGI are working on a paper for this , but there is also"
[25:58] mn007 | the
[26:04] mn007 | uh which has an extended deadline . So .
"[26:09] me013 | For uh Oh , for Eurospeech ?"
[26:10] mn007 | For th
[26:12] me013 | Oh !
[26:17] me018 | Mm - hmm . Where is Eurospeech this year ?
[26:20] mn007 | It 's in Denmark .
[26:25] me013 | So the deadline When 's the deadline ?
[26:27] mn007 | Hmm ?
[26:28] me013 | When 's the deadline ?
[26:28] mn007 | I think it 's the thirteenth of May .
[26:31] me013 | That 's great !
[26:35] me013 | It 's great . So we should definitely get something in for that .
[26:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[26:47] me013 | Yeah .
[26:47] mn007 | Nnn .
[27:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[27:41] me013 | Good .
"[27:42] me026 | That 's cool . And if you 're interested in using CVS , I 've set it up here , so ."
[27:47] me026 | um j
[27:52] me026 | Oh . So . I 'll be away tomorrow and Monday but I 'll be back on Tuesday or Wednesday .
"[27:58] me013 | Yeah . Dave , the other thing , actually , is is this business about this wave form . Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page , cuz uh the uh um I mean , actually the the uh"
[28:38] me026 | Yeah .
[28:50] me026 | A boom .
"[28:50] me013 | Well that that that 's OK . But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again , because you 're you 're you 're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out you know , you you look at the good one , you look at the cru the screwed up one , and and you can see the features in it without trying to @ @ yeah ."
[28:53] me026 | Yeah .
[29:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:25] me013 | So I mean you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say "" Oh yeah . This this really distorted it quite a bit . """
[29:42] me013 | Right .
[29:47] me013 | But it 's it 's uh So .
[29:55] me013 | reduced high frequencies . But um
[30:06] me013 | uh they they do look quite different .
[30:09] me013 | Uh .
[30:19] me013 | I want something that has a is a more interesting explanation for why they 're different .
[30:25] me013 | Um .
[30:25] me026 | Oh . So maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms and um then do some kind of
[30:30] me026 | zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area .
[30:34] me026 | Uh - huh .
"[31:09] me013 | the voice coming in , too , I think , since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it ."
[31:11] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[31:29] me013 | @ @
[31:35] mn007 | figures here . Well . I start we started to work on spectral subtraction . And
[31:44] mn007 | So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before
[31:44] me013 | Uh - huh .
[31:55] mn007 | And it hurts uh a lot .
[31:59] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[32:04] mn007 | well ,"
[32:13] mn007 | So you have the C - zero parameters for
[32:17] mn007 | one uh Italian utterance .
"[32:28] mn007 | And it 's perfectly synchronized , so ."
"[32:31] mn007 | And the sentence contain only one word , which is "" Due """
[32:37] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[32:38] me018 | This is this is , oh , a plot of C - zero , the energy ."
[32:38] me006 | Hmm .
"[32:41] mn007 | This is a plot of C - zero ,"
"[32:44] mn007 | uh when we don't use spectral substraction , and when there is no on - line normalization ."
[32:52] mn007 | So .
[33:00] mn007 | So .
[33:02] mn007 | Yeah . Yeah .
[33:06] me018 | Yeah .
"[33:06] mn007 | Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure ,"
[33:15] mn007 | though it is not .
[33:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[33:24] mn007 | And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization .
[33:32] mn007 | So .
[33:43] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[33:44] me018 | This is still being a plot of C - zero ?
[33:47] me018 | OK . Can I ask um what does variance normalization do ? w What is the effect of that ?
[33:54] me013 | Normalizes the variance .
[33:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[34:05] mn007 | Yeah but .
[34:07] me013 | What 's the rationale ?
[34:09] me018 | Why why do it ?
[34:10] mn007 | Uh .
"[34:13] me013 | everything uh If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances . So if there 's an overall"
[34:19] me018 | Yeah .
[34:32] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[34:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:03] me013 | if more was coming from outside , then there 'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the So"
[35:16] me018 | Uh - huh . I see . OK .
[35:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[35:42] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[35:45] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[35:50] me018 | OK .
[35:53] me013 | that have nothing to do with the linguistic component .
"[36:02] me013 | If you have a good voice activity detector , isn't isn't it gonna pull that out ?"
[36:07] mn007 | Yeah . Sure . If they are good . Yeah .
"[36:09] mn007 | Well what it it shows is that , yeah ,"
[36:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[36:33] mn007 | Yeah .
[36:34] mn007 | So .
"[36:35] mn007 | What I notice is that , while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one ,"
[36:42] me018 | Yeah .
"[36:43] mn007 | But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different"
[36:49] mn007 | than when you use variance normalization
[36:52] me013 | Right .
"[36:57] mn007 | Yeah , but here Yeah ."
"[36:58] me018 | You 're more interested in the difference between the speech and the nonspeech , right ?"
"[37:00] mn007 | Yeah . So I think , yeah ."
[37:10] mn007 | uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition .
"[37:16] me013 | Yeah . So basically you want to reduce this effect . So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection . You also could do it by spect uh spectral subtraction before the variance normalization , right ?"
"[37:17] mn007 | Well , y"
"[37:26] mn007 | Yeah , but it 's not clear , yeah ."
[37:32] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:41] mn007 | well ,"
[37:43] mn007 | it 's better with variance normalization .
[37:45] me013 | Yeah . Yeah . So it does get better even though it looks ugly . OK .
[37:52] mn007 | Yeah .
[37:53] me013 | OK .
[37:55] me006 | OK .
[37:55] me013 | So .
[37:56] me018 | Where 's th
[37:56] mn007 | But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one . So .
[38:01] mn007 | Yeah .
[38:03] me013 | Uh - huh .
[38:04] me018 | Where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ?
[38:09] mn007 | Hmm ?
"[38:12] mn007 | It 's applied before variance normalization . So it 's a good thing , because"
[38:16] me018 | Oh . Yeah .
[38:16] mn007 | I guess voice activity detection on this
[38:20] mn007 | should could be worse .
"[38:25] mn007 | It 's applied the um on ,"
"[38:29] mn007 | yeah , something like this , yeah ."
[38:31] me018 | Maybe that 's why it doesn't work for channel one .
[38:34] mn007 | So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD .
[38:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:48] me013 | folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? """
[38:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[38:56] mn007 | About ? Spectral subtraction ?
[38:58] me013 | Yeah .
[39:13] me013 | OK .
[39:13] mn007 | uh fff Well .
[39:19] me013 | Yeah .
[39:20] mn007 | Um .
[39:27] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[39:28] me018 | Speech is more what ?
"[39:28] mn007 | than than before . Well ,"
[39:30] mn007 | the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger .
[39:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[40:01] mn007 | you also increase the variance of this of C - zero .
"[40:04] mn007 | And so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw"
[40:04] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[40:10] mn007 | everything . Well .
[40:11] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[40:12] mn007 | Um .
[40:15] mn007 | Uh . Yeah .
[40:27] mn007 | Yeah .
"[40:51] me013 | Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do , if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing . Um ."
[40:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[41:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[41:07] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[41:09] me013 | Um .
"[41:16] mn007 | Yeah , well , uh ."
[41:23] me018 | um
[41:50] mn007 | Mmm .
[41:52] me013 | I don't know .
"[41:55] me013 | I mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be ."
[42:15] mn007 | Yeah . But I think they ' r
[42:21] mn007 | Uh . yeah .
"[42:25] mn007 | but um ,"
[42:27] mn007 | yeah .
[42:28] mn007 | And they are t
"[42:30] mn007 | I think they want to work on the second stream also , but more with some kind of multi - band or , well ,"
[42:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:41] mn007 | Um .
[42:44] mn007 | So .
[42:48] mn007 | Yeah .
[42:49] me013 | Yeah . Um .
"[42:51] me013 | Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the VAD V A Ds performing quite differently ?"
[43:01] mn007 | Mmm .
[43:11] me013 | And it looks like the the French VAD is actually uh better significantly better .
[43:16] me018 | Improves the baseline ?
[43:17] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[43:18] mn007 | Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use .
[43:21] mn007 | Uh .
[43:22] mn007 | If the use the small VAD
[43:29] mn007 | I think it 's easy to do better because it doesn't work at all .
[43:32] mn007 | So .
[43:34] mn007 | I I don't know which which one . It 's Pratibha that that did this experiment .
[43:39] fn002 | Yeah .
[43:39] mn007 | Um . We should ask which VAD
[43:40] fn002 | I don't @ @ .
"[43:43] fn002 | He Actually , I think that he say with the good VAD of from OGI"
[43:43] mn007 | she used .
[43:50] fn002 | and with the Alcatel VAD .
"[43:53] fn002 | And the experiment was sometime better , sometime worse ."
[43:56] mn007 | Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features .
[44:03] me013 | Yes .
[44:03] mn007 | Yeah .
[44:05] fn002 | I don't remember .
"[44:05] me013 | And on that one , uh the French one is was better ."
[44:08] me013 | It was just better .
[44:09] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[44:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[44:20] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:22] me013 | So . Uh . So if they have a better one , we should use it . I mean . You know ? it 's you can't work on everything . Uh ."
[44:30] mn007 | Yeah .
[44:38] me013 | Yeah .
[44:41] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[44:41] me013 | Yeah .
[44:50] me013 | Yeah .
[44:50] mn007 | as as you 've mentioned . Mmm .
"[44:54] me013 | H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next , back back in the country . So . And start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth , and uh"
[45:03] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[45:10] me013 | working towards June .
[45:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[45:15] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[45:27] mn007 | Yeah .
[45:29] mn007 | Yeah .
"[45:32] mn007 | Yeah , my feeling is that"
"[45:37] mn007 | when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope and"
[45:43] me013 | Right .
[45:44] mn007 | um
[45:46] me013 | No use of pitch uh basically . Yeah .
[45:52] mn007 | at the at the high re high resolution spectrum .
[45:53] me013 | Yeah .
[45:54] mn007 | So .
[46:09] mn007 | It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency and .
"[46:14] mn007 | So there would be more ,"
[46:15] me013 | Yeah .
[46:20] mn007 | and then voiced sound are more high frequencies
[46:25] me013 | Right .
"[46:26] mn007 | But ,"
[46:35] mn007 | So .
[46:37] me018 | Isn't there some other
[46:39] mn007 | S
"[46:40] mn007 | So I think that it it would be good Yeah , yeah , well , go go on ."
[47:01] mn007 | Mmm .
[47:03] me018 | Yeah .
[47:04] me018 | Well even with e uh w ah
[47:05] me013 | Yeah .
[47:07] mn007 | Mmm .
[47:14] mn007 | So .
[47:16] me018 | OK . So go ahead .
"[47:17] mn007 | Um yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to"
[47:22] mn007 | develop a second stream
"[47:36] mn007 | Yeah , so I don't know . We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul ,"
"[47:42] mn007 | have a good voice detector ,"
"[47:44] mn007 | have a good , well , voiced - speech detector ,"
[47:56] mn007 | kind of uh taking the spectrum and
[48:01] mn007 | computing the variance
[48:03] mn007 | of of the high resolution spectrum and
[48:07] mn007 | things like this .
[48:16] me013 | making use of
[48:20] mn007 | Yeah ?
[48:23] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[48:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[48:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[48:58] mn007 | Yeah .
[48:58] mn007 | Yeah .
[49:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[49:13] mn007 | Mmm .
[49:15] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[49:20] mn007 | Yeah . Mmm .
[49:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[49:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[50:03] me013 | I guess we could
[50:06] me013 | Yeah .
"[50:14] me018 | I I 'm not sure , exactly , what the gist of what he was saying , but"
[50:28] mn007 | Mmm .
[50:30] mn007 | Mmm .
"[50:39] me013 | yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth , if you do view it as probabilities ,"
"[51:02] me013 | outputs and all the unvoiced outputs , you know ,"
[51:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[51:11] mn007 | Yeah .
"[51:13] me013 | uh and do the KLT on the on on that , then that would that would I guess"
[51:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:21] me013 | be uh a reasonable use of independent information .
[51:25] me013 | So maybe that 's what you meant .
[51:34] mn007 | So you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing and then
[51:38] me013 | R
[51:39] mn007 | use a tandem system and
[51:41] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:42] me013 | Yeah . If you have a tandem system and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net we used we d did some of this stuff . Uh I I did , some years ago , and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different"
[51:48] mn007 | Yeah .
"[51:56] me013 | as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one , and uh then you only use for this one distinction ."
[51:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[52:09] mn007 | Alright .
"[52:10] me013 | And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases , and you 've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side . You multiply them where appropriate and uh um"
"[52:21] mn007 | I see , yeah . Mm - hmm ."
[52:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[52:31] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[52:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[52:36] mn007 | Yeah .
"[52:39] me013 | Yeah , that 's a good idea ."
"[52:45] mn007 | Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction"
[53:01] me013 | Yeah .
[53:04] mn007 | Well it 's this musical noise which is
[53:13] mn007 | Um .
[53:18] mn007 | Yeah .
[53:23] mn007 | to go together very well .
[53:24] mn007 | I
"[53:35] mn007 | Ah , yeah ."
[53:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[53:54] me013 | it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing and uh
[53:56] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[53:58] me013 | uh should have some interesting properties in noise .
[54:21] me013 | Uh .
[54:22] me013 | Has not .
"[54:22] mn007 | it i has not , yeah ."
[54:24] mn007 | Oh .
[54:27] me013 | that 's that 's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams .
[54:38] mn007 | you just
[54:39] mn007 | Yeah .
[54:46] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[54:47] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[54:57] mn007 | thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where
[55:00] me013 | Uh - huh .
[55:01] mn007 | we would use TIMIT and see
[55:04] mn007 | if giving
[55:06] mn007 | the d
[55:12] mn007 | in terms of uh frame classification . Mmm .
"[55:20] mn007 | B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing . Well ."
[55:20] me006 | We need labels .
[55:22] me013 | Why not ?
"[55:24] mn007 | Cuz we don't have Well , for Italian perhaps we have , but we don't have this labeling"
[55:29] mn007 | for Aurora . We just have a labeling with word models but
[55:33] me013 | I see .
[55:34] fn002 | Not for foreigners .
[55:34] me006 | we don't have frame frame level
[55:34] mn007 | not for phonemes .
[55:37] me013 | Um .
[55:38] me006 | transcriptions .
[55:39] mn007 | Um .
[55:48] mn007 | Yeah .
[55:52] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[55:53] me013 | Oh .
[55:58] me013 | Yeah .
[56:00] me013 | I see .
[56:06] mn007 | Yeah .
"[56:07] mn007 | noise , yeah ."
[56:11] me006 | um portion of Aurora .
"[56:13] mn007 | Yeah , that 's right , yep ."
[56:15] mn007 | Mmm .
[56:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[56:21] mn007 | we can say that it will help , but"
[56:24] mn007 | I don't know .
"[56:25] mn007 | If this voicing bit doesn't help , uh ,"
[56:35] mn007 | Uh .
[56:36] mn007 | It 's just to know if it how much i it will help and to have an idea of
[56:38] me013 | Yeah .
[56:40] me013 | Right .
[56:41] mn007 | how much we can gain .
[56:43] mn007 | Mmm .
"[56:58] me013 | And um ,"
[57:00] me013 | so um
"[57:03] me013 | what that said is that ,"
"[57:06] me013 | sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding one oh"
"[57:19] me018 | It also Yeah , the though I think uh there was one problem with that in that , you know , we used canonical mapping so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics ."
[57:29] me013 | Uh - huh .
[57:30] me006 | Hmm .
[57:31] me018 | So .
[57:31] mn007 | Mmm .
[57:45] me013 | speaker - dependent actually .
[57:47] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[57:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[58:05] me018 | Wow !
[58:05] me013 | and and uh for for that particular speaker and you 'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them .
[58:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[58:10] me013 | And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error .
[58:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[58:19] mn007 | Mmm .
[58:26] me013 | um
[58:33] me013 | significantly worse than that .
[58:35] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[58:39] mn007 | all the the SpeechCorders ? what 's the idea behind ?
"[58:44] mn007 | Oh , they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech ?"
[58:47] me013 | The modern ones don't do a a simple switch . They work on the code book excitation . Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis . They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best .
[58:49] mn007 | They just work on the code book and
[58:52] mn007 | find out the best
[58:53] mn007 | excitation .
[58:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[58:59] mn007 | Mmm .
[59:00] mn007 | Alright .
[59:05] me006 | Hmm .
[59:06] me013 | Uh .
[59:09] me013 | O K .
[59:11] me013 | Yeah .
[59:12] me018 | Um .
[59:20] me018 | Um .
[59:22] me018 | Actually I I s we didn't I guess I wrote this in after the meeting b but the thought I had was
[59:28] me018 | um
[59:37] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[59:38] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[59:50] me018 | So .
[59:57] me013 | Right .
"[59:57] me018 | And the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two - long or three - long digit strings in any of the Aurora training data . So it 's either one , four , five , six , uh up to eleven , and then it skips and then there 's some at sixteen ."
"[00:23] me018 | Yeah . But I just thought that was a little odd ,"
"[00:28] me018 | Sorry . So I I just for the heck of it , I made a little grammar which um ,"
[00:36] me018 | for each length digit string you could get . So there was a one - long path and there was a
[00:41] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[00:47] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:48] me018 | you know , I I didn't have any weights of these paths or I didn't have anything like that . And I played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch , but I couldn't go anywhere ."
[00:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[00:55] me018 | But um .
[00:56] me013 | Hmm .
"[00:58] me018 | Yeah , I guess I should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two - long or a three - long path was actually put out as a hypothesis . Um . But ."
[01:08] me013 | Hmm .
[01:24] me018 | Yeah .
[01:33] me013 | Sure .

[00:00] me011 | OK .
"[00:01] me018 | @ @ Adam , what is the mike that , uh , Jeremy 's wearing ?"
[00:04] me011 | It 's the ear - plug mike .
[00:06] fe016 | That 's good .
[00:09] me011 | No .
[00:09] me018 | Oh .
[00:09] me051 | It 's wired .
[00:11] me013 | Oh !
[00:13] me001 | It 's old - school .
"[00:18] me013 | Should we , uh , close the door , maybe ? So it 's Yeah ."
"[00:19] me011 | It it 's a fairly good mike , actually ."
[00:25] me013 | Huh .
[00:31] me011 | the quality .
[00:35] me013 | OK .
"[00:43] me013 | So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week , it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on"
[00:55] me011 | Right .
[00:57] me013 | So which week are we in ?
"[01:00] me011 | We haven't really started , but I thought"
[01:07] me013 | I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too .
"[01:11] me011 | But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each . So ."
[01:11] me018 | Yeah .
[01:14] me013 | Yeah .
[01:17] me011 | I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted . Here we go .
"[01:22] me011 | So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies and , uh ,"
"[01:31] me011 | any comments on them . So , no on no one has bleeped out anything ."
[01:35] me013 | Um .
[01:35] me011 | So .
[01:37] me011 | I don't expect anyone to . But .
"[01:39] me013 | So , w what follows ? At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ?"
[01:43] me011 | No .
[01:44] me011 | We had spoken w about this before and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once .
"[01:46] me013 | Yeah , but I 've forgotten ."
[01:50] me011 | And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity .
"[01:54] me011 | So as long as we do that , we 're covered ."
"[01:58] me011 | Uh , July fifteenth ."
[02:00] me013 | July fifteenth .
"[02:01] me013 | Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y"
[02:08] me013 | Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to ?
"[02:09] me011 | Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it ."
"[02:11] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[02:11] fe008 | Oh . I just meant that
[02:12] fe008 | that was the release date that you had on the data .
[02:16] me011 | Oh . I I didn't understand that there was
"[02:21] me011 | I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put . So ."
[02:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[02:29] me013 | this meeting starts .
[02:30] fe008 | That 's right . That 's why .
"[02:31] me013 | Oh , I see ."
"[02:34] fe008 | You said you wanted it to be available then . I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline . It 's fine with me if it is , or we cou But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that"
[02:34] me013 | OK .
[02:41] me013 | w
"[02:43] fe008 | in case , uh you know , "" by the way this is your last """
[02:46] fe008 | Uh . Yeah .
"[02:51] me013 | give it to people July fifteenth , if somebody 's gonna come back and say "" OK , I don't want this and this and this used "" , uh , clearly we need some time"
[02:59] me013 | to respond to that . Right ?
"[03:01] me011 | I just got one date and that 's the one I used . So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us ."
[03:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:07] me011 | I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was ,"
"[03:11] me011 | uh , these the meetings that in are in set one ."
[03:12] me018 | Was my was my response OK ? I just wrote you replied to the email saying they 're all fine .
"[03:16] me011 | Right . I mean , that 's fine ."
"[03:17] me018 | OK , good ."
"[03:18] me011 | I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that ,"
"[03:25] me011 | uh , we don't actually need a reply ."
[03:28] me011 | We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .
[03:29] me013 | OK .
[03:31] me011 | And so no reply is
[03:33] me011 | no changes .
"[03:34] fe008 | And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is "" OK "" ."
[03:34] me013 | OK .
"[03:38] fe008 | So that 's very clear all the way down the page , "" OK "" . And they have two options they can change it to . One of them is "" censor "" , and the other one is "" incorrect "" ."
"[03:45] fe008 | Is it is your word is "" incorrect "" ? Which means also we get feedback on if um , there 's something that they w"
[03:46] me011 | Right .
"[03:52] fe008 | that needs to be adjusted , because , I mean , these are very highly technical things . I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it . But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong . So ."
"[04:04] me011 | Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,"
"[04:14] fe008 | was because it , um it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it ."
[04:19] me011 | Right .
[04:20] fe008 | Approve it and correct it .
[04:22] fe008 | And um .
[04:30] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[04:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm . And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder .
[04:32] me011 | So .
[04:42] me018 | The German ones ?
[04:45] me013 | NSA .
"[04:52] me018 | Oh , those are the NSA meetings ?"
[04:54] fe008 | Yeah . Uh - huh .
"[04:54] me018 | Oh , oh ! OK ."
[04:58] me018 | OK . I 'd I d
[04:58] fe008 | Yeah . It 's the other group .
[05:00] me013 | network services group . Yeah .
[05:00] me018 | OK .
[05:01] fe008 | Uh - huh .
"[05:02] fe008 | Yeah , exactly . Yeah ."
[05:02] fe008 | I didn't mean to isolate them .
[05:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:14] fe008 | And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like a week before that , uh , J July fifteenth date , or two weeks before ."
"[05:22] me013 | I mean , I would suggest we discuss I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,"
[05:27] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[05:31] me018 | Twelve hours .
[05:37] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[05:42] me011 | we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .
[05:46] fe008 | Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .
[05:51] me011 | What else can we do ?
"[05:53] me011 | If someone says "" hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed "" ."
[06:00] me011 | What can we do ? We have to remove it .
"[06:26] me013 | OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two weeks , or if we say a month ,"
"[06:43] me013 | "" and , uh , because we w """
"[06:53] me013 | to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time "" , whatever time we agree upon ."
"[07:06] me011 | No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ?"
"[07:23] me011 | I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email . And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?"
[07:23] fe008 | OK .
[07:27] fe008 | Yeah .
[07:29] fe008 | I I think that there 's one missing line .
[07:36] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[07:41] me011 | Right .
[07:41] me013 | So what I 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough
[07:48] me013 | and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying .
[07:52] me011 | OK .
[07:53] me013 | OK ?
"[08:07] me013 | It well , it well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you"
"[08:15] me013 | uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it ."
[08:19] fe008 | OK .
"[08:20] me013 | That 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take ."
"[08:24] mn017 | S so maybe when Am I on , by the way ?"
[08:27] mn017 | Oh . Hello ? Hello ?
[08:27] me011 | You should be .
[08:30] me011 | You should be channel B .
"[08:43] mn017 | you know , specify exactly"
"[08:45] mn017 | uh , what ,"
[08:56] fe016 | Yeah .
"[08:57] mn017 | A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't if we don't hear from them ,"
"[09:11] me011 | Well , they 've already signed a form ."
[09:13] mn017 | @ @ Right .
[09:13] fe016 | And nobody nobody really reads it anyway .
[09:14] me011 | So . And the s and the form was
[09:14] mn017 | Says that .
[09:16] mn017 | Right .
"[09:17] me011 | approved by Human Subjects , so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify ."
"[09:17] fe008 | Uh , the f"
[09:21] mn017 | I see .
"[09:25] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
[09:28] fe008 | It doesn't have a time limit .
[09:31] mn017 | y the review process ?
"[09:31] fe008 | That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to remove things that you 'd like to remove ,"
"[09:33] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
[09:37] mn017 | Hmm .
"[09:39] fe008 | before it goes to the general uh , larger audience ."
[09:40] mn017 | Right .
[09:42] mn017 | Oh .
[09:42] fe008 | There you go .
[09:45] mn017 | OK .
"[09:46] fe016 | I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam , like ,"
"[09:51] fe016 | "" I got this and I will do it by this date ,"
"[09:54] fe016 | and if you don't hear from me by then "" You know , in other words responding to your email once ,"
[09:58] me011 | Right .
"[10:02] fe016 | And then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ?"
[10:16] me011 | So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say
"[10:19] me011 | "" on the fifteenth , the data is released , if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it "" ."
[10:20] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:57] fe016 | And so someone whose machine is down or whatever I mean ,"
[11:01] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:01] fe016 | we have no in internally we know that people are there , but we have no confirmation that they got the mail ."
"[11:03] me011 | Well , OK . l Let me Let me reverse this ."
"[11:06] me011 | So let 's say someone I send this out , and someone doesn't respond ."
[11:10] me011 | Do we delete every meeting that they were in ?
[11:15] mn017 | No .
[11:19] mn017 | That will happen .
[11:19] me011 | That will absolutely happen .
"[11:21] me011 | Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say "" I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything "" and they don just won't reply to it ."
"[11:26] mn017 | Maybe uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ?"
"[11:28] me011 | No . We have what they put on the speaker form , which was just generic contact information ."
[11:29] mn017 | No .
[11:31] mn017 | Oh .
[11:36] mn017 | Mmm .
[11:38] mn017 | OK .
"[11:54] me011 | Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago . And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again ."
"[11:56] fe008 | Yes , we did ."
[11:58] fe008 | You 're right .
[12:03] fe008 | That 's right .
[12:04] fe016 | You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .
[12:05] fe008 | Need to get it right .
[12:10] fe016 | I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email . And maybe it 's better legally to
[12:21] fe008 | It 's much easier to explain this way . T t to have it on record .
"[12:22] me011 | OK . Well , why don't you talk t Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it ,"
[12:26] me011 | and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to . Because
"[12:31] me011 | what I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email ."
"[12:34] me011 | No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with ."
"[12:39] me001 | I mean , i it 's k"
[12:40] mn017 | Hmm .
"[12:40] fe008 | Well , then we make the effort ."
"[12:41] me001 | It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways . I mean , and either way works probably , I mean ."
[12:41] fe008 | We make the effort .
"[12:53] fe008 | and not have to after the fact say "" oh , but I assumed "" , and "" oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you "" , you know ."
"[13:00] me013 | If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it ."
"[13:04] fe008 | Oh , excellent ."
"[13:11] me013 | from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something"
[13:17] me013 | on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this .
[13:17] fe008 | Yes .
"[13:21] me011 | Well , we had talked about this before and I thought that we had"
[13:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[13:25] me011 | even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said
[13:28] me011 | you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form that they 've already signed once .
[13:39] me011 | OK .
[13:39] me013 | Yeah . We never really talked about that .
[13:40] fe016 | Or the date at which they would be receiving the email
[13:43] me013 | Yeah .
[13:43] fe016 | from you .
[13:44] fe016 | They probably forgot all about it . Yeah .
"[13:50] me013 | made the , uh , uh , materials available . That was something that was sort of just within our implementation ."
[13:55] me011 | OK .
[14:10] me001 | And they 're served .
"[14:14] mn017 | So you just make it , you know , "" oh , you won you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh you 're """
[14:19] fe008 | That one .
[14:21] me013 | Yeah .
"[14:26] fe008 | Well , it doesn't matter ."
"[14:36] mn017 | you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh ,"
"[14:40] mn017 | assume their consent if they don't reply . But , I 'm not you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't"
[14:42] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:52] mn017 | Yeah .
[14:56] me011 | Right .
[14:59] me011 | For for th
"[15:01] fe008 | uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have"
"[15:05] fe008 | @ @ us try to contact them , u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . I think they 'd appreciate it ."
[15:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:23] me013 | uh , h how m"
[15:29] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm . I remember that .
"[15:32] me013 | But , um , the attorneys , I uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with and we have to decide how"
"[15:49] me013 | that they have , uh , in fact O K 'd it ."
[15:52] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:55] me013 | I think that if you f i if we send the email as you have and if there 's
"[16:00] me013 | half the people , say , who don't respond at all by , you know , some period of time ,"
[16:10] me011 | Right .
"[16:13] me013 | Is is this OK ? And would you please mail you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . """
"[16:19] me013 | So , you know , we can we can do that ."
"[16:23] fe016 | at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying "" yes , I will do it "" or "" yes , I got your email "" , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it ."
[16:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:38] fe016 | their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd at al at all ."
"[16:44] fe016 | That 's how these mailing houses work . So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses ."
"[16:52] fe016 | You know , an official OK from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email ."
[16:58] fe016 | And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email .
[17:06] fe008 | fostering goodwill among our subjects .
"[17:08] fe008 | Well , our participants ."
[17:12] me011 | Yep .
"[17:14] me013 | And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually"
"[17:24] me013 | what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,"
"[17:35] me013 | um , then we haven't given them that ."
"[17:36] me011 | Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ?"
[17:41] me013 | I i i em email is enough .
[17:44] me011 | OK .
"[17:46] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I 've been through this I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now so I I"
[17:51] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[17:53] me013 | I I 'm pretty comfortable with that .
[17:58] me018 | when people log in
[18:00] me018 | to look at the ?
[18:03] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[18:03] me011 | If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient ."
[18:08] me018 | Hmm .
[18:08] me011 | Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular .
[18:13] me018 | Except that you know they got the mail .
[18:14] fe008 | Mm - hmm . That 's right . I I could get you on the notify list if you want me to .
[18:14] me011 | Right .
[18:18] me011 | I 'm already on it .
"[18:19] fe008 | For that directory ? OK , great ."
[18:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:33] me013 | uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people ."
"[18:36] me011 | For this set , I 'm not worried , because we basically know everyone on it ."
[18:38] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[18:40] fe008 | Hmm .
[18:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:45] me011 | But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI ,"
[18:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:49] me011 | whose email addresses may or may not work ,"
[18:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[18:54] me011 | So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ?
[19:01] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:04] fe008 | They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through I I mean , I I w I 'll be able to if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them ."
[19:07] me011 | Other methods ?
[19:11] me011 | OK .
"[19:25] me013 | that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So ."
[19:35] me013 | Right .
"[19:35] me011 | And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh ,"
[19:39] me011 | any other contact method .
"[19:49] me011 | So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate"
[19:53] me013 | Yeah .
[19:54] fe016 | Then they just come back .
[19:57] me011 | that we fulfilled our burden .
[20:04] me011 | OK .
[20:06] fe008 | I d I just don't think we will .
[20:07] me011 | Alright .
[20:08] fe008 | For all the reasons that we 've discussed .
[20:09] me013 | So we 'll we 'll see if we do or not .
[20:10] me011 | Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .
[20:10] fe008 | Yeah .
"[20:12] me011 | So far , two people have . So ."
[20:24] me011 | Right .
"[20:28] fe008 | didn't anticipate this so I that 's why I didn't give this comment , and it I this discussion has made me think it might be nice"
"[20:35] fe008 | to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying "" by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date"
"[20:44] fe008 | and please "" , and then add what Liz said "" please , uh , respond to please indicate you received this mail . """
"[20:50] me013 | Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um ,"
"[20:53] me013 | "" Even if you 've decided you have no"
"[20:56] me013 | changes you 'd like to make , if you could"
"[20:58] me013 | tell us that "" . Yeah ."
[20:58] me011 | Respond to the email . Yep .
[20:59] fe008 | Mm - hmm . It is the first time through the cycle .
"[20:59] fe016 | Right . That would that would definitely work on me . You know , it makes you feel m like ,"
"[21:04] fe016 | um ,"
"[21:05] fe016 | if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that ."
"[21:11] fe016 | Whereas , I I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,"
[21:14] me018 | And the other th
"[21:14] fe016 | given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying "" you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it "" or whatever ,"
"[21:19] fe016 | rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , and never really ,"
"[21:24] fe016 | uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late ."
[21:26] me018 | I was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this .
[21:31] fe016 | Right . R Right . That 's true .
[21:32] me013 | Right .
"[21:35] me018 | they can see from that email that if they just write back and say "" I got it , no changes "" ,"
[21:39] me013 | Yeah .
[21:41] fe016 | Yeah . That 's true .
"[21:47] me013 | if you say "" you 've got three months to do this review "" ,"
"[21:50] me013 | um , people do it , you know ,"
"[21:52] me013 | two and seven eighths months from now . If you say "" you 've got three weeks to do this review "" , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review ."
[21:54] me011 | Right .
"[22:02] me013 | So ,"
[22:09] me011 | if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .
"[22:14] me013 | There 's the responding part and there 's also what if ,"
[22:21] me011 | Right .
[22:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Some lead time .
"[22:25] me011 | Ugh ! Disk space , oh my god ! I hadn't thought about that ."
[22:29] fe008 | OK .
[22:32] me011 | any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of .
[22:37] me001 | Can't you just do that channel ?
"[22:39] me011 | No , of course not . You need all the channels ."
"[22:40] fe016 | Yeah . You have to do all of them ,"
[22:41] me001 | Oh .
[22:42] me018 | Do you have to do the other close - talking ?
[22:42] fe016 | as well as all of these .
[22:43] me001 | Yeah .
[22:43] me051 | Wow .
[22:44] me011 | Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .
"[22:44] fe016 | You have to do all You could just do it in that time period , though , but I guess it 's a pain ."
[22:50] fe016 | Yeah .
[22:52] fe016 | Yeah . You 're right .
"[22:52] fe008 | Well I you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy ."
"[23:00] me011 | So I I don't want I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than"
[23:04] me013 | Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?
"[23:08] me011 | Overlapping . So ,"
[23:10] me011 | it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep .
[23:13] me013 | I I
"[23:14] me013 | I I understand , but is is it summing signals or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ?"
[23:24] me011 | Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again .
[23:30] me011 | Say again ?
"[23:33] fe008 | Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the ?"
[23:35] me013 | Encrypt it .
[23:36] me001 | You can hide it . Yeah .
"[23:37] mn017 | Oh , yeah ."
[23:37] fe008 | Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ?
[23:38] fe016 | Right . Exactly . I see .
[23:38] me001 | It wouldn't be that hard
[23:40] me001 | to hide it .
[23:40] fe008 | OK .
"[23:42] me001 | You can use spread spectrum . Hide it . Yeah , there you go ."
[23:43] me018 | Uh - huh .
[23:44] fe016 | Yeah . Yeah . Cuz we don't have enough asides .
[23:48] me001 | There you go .
[23:50] me011 | Backwards .
[23:53] me011 | ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments . Did you read that paper ?
[23:59] mn017 | No .
[24:05] me013 | Yeah .
[24:05] me018 | That 's cuz they use forward - backward .
"[24:05] fe016 | H - good old HMM . No , it 's backward - forward ."
[24:07] me011 | Forward but backward . That 's right . Good point .
[24:10] me011 | A point .
[24:12] me013 | Uh .
[24:21] fe008 | Hmm .
[24:21] me011 | So . Yeah .
[24:23] fe008 | This is the first cycle . There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through .
"[24:25] me013 | And , uh and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and and stuff comes in as"
[24:37] me013 | Yeah .
"[24:38] me011 | you know , I have my stack of emails of to d to be done ,"
"[24:42] me011 | that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to ."
[24:47] me018 | Move them to the bottom .
"[24:49] me011 | Yeah , right ."
[24:55] me011 | Yeah .
[24:56] me011 | Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify
[24:56] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:03] fe016 | Right .
[25:04] fe008 | And it also doesn't give a a specific I didn't think of it .
[25:06] fe008 | S I think it 's a good idea an ex explicit time by which this will be considered
"[25:11] me011 | Yeah , release ."
[25:11] fe008 | definite .
[25:12] fe008 | And and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint .
[25:14] me013 | Yeah . It 's converging .
[25:17] fe008 | Yeah . That 's right .
"[25:20] mn017 | i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually"
"[25:25] mn017 | says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt of the of the mail ."
[25:30] me001 | Hmm .
[25:32] me001 | It 's like certified mail .
[25:34] fe008 | Could do that .
"[25:36] mn017 | No , no , no . This is different . This is not So , I I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox . But but , no . This was different ."
[25:42] fe008 | Mmm .
[25:44] me011 | Right .
"[25:49] me011 | Oh , just a button . Oh , yeah ."
"[25:49] mn017 | uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send ,"
"[25:54] mn017 | uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail ."
"[26:01] mn017 | But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n"
[26:05] me011 | Yeah .
"[26:07] me013 | And we actually need a third thing . It 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions . Right ?"
[26:16] me013 | Oh ?
"[26:17] me013 | Oh , I see ."
"[26:22] mn017 | uh , you know , I acknowledge """
"[26:22] me013 | That i i my first - born children are yours , and Yeah ."
[26:27] me013 | Yeah .
"[26:29] me011 | Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So ."
[26:36] me011 | Yeah . Reply .
[26:36] me013 | Yeah .
[26:36] mn017 | Right .
[26:38] me013 | Yeah .
"[26:43] me011 | Well , I cuz I use a text mail reader ."
[26:50] mn017 | So I i
"[26:52] mn017 | There 's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like "" powered by VI "" ."
[26:58] me013 | Wow .
"[26:59] fe016 | Anyway , quick question . How m"
[26:59] me011 | You could put wed bugs in the email .
[26:59] me001 | I see .
[27:00] mn017 | Yeah .
"[27:01] fe016 | Like , there were three meetings this time , or so or how many ? Six ?"
[27:03] fe008 | Six .
"[27:12] fe016 | Like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ?"
[27:19] fe016 | In th
[27:20] fe016 | I don't know .
"[27:26] fe016 | Oh . Oh , OK . So this time was just the first chunk . OK ."
"[27:30] fe016 | Well , that 's a good idea ."
"[27:31] me011 | I mean , maybe Is that the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ?"
"[27:45] fe008 | But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable . People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then ."
[27:48] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:00] fe008 | Uh , unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then ,"
"[28:12] fe008 | But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available ."
[28:20] fe016 | OK .
[28:28] me013 | We heard anything from IBM ?
"[28:37] me018 | Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix ."
"[28:43] me018 | And then , um , we , uh I sent him a pointer to three more ."
[28:48] me018 | And so he 's off and working on those .
"[28:51] me011 | Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff . So at some point we need to do that ."
[28:58] fe008 | That 's on my list .
"[29:00] fe008 | Well , that 's on my list ."
[29:03] me018 | process .
[29:10] me011 | So .
[29:11] fe008 | Hmm .
[29:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:17] fe008 | Mm - hmm , mm - hmm ."
"[29:18] me011 | Yes , absolutely . Yeah ."
"[29:24] me011 | Yes , absolutely . Absolutely ."
"[29:24] fe008 | Oh , interesting ."
"[29:26] fe008 | Oh , interesting . OK ."
[29:27] me011 | Yeah . They 're they 're not in the segmented . It 's not that the IBM people didn't do it .
[29:30] fe008 | OK .
[29:32] fe008 | OK .
[29:33] me011 | Just they didn't get marked .
[29:43] fe008 | We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings
[29:47] fe008 | and they 're downloading the
"[29:49] fe008 | audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's Chuck 's , uh ,"
[29:53] fe008 | put that in .
"[29:54] me018 | Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the"
[29:59] me018 | web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can .
"[30:02] me018 | And , um , then once , uh ,"
"[30:05] me018 | th we can also point them at the , um ,"
"[30:08] me018 | uh , the original meetings"
"[30:10] me018 | and they can grab those , too , with SCP ."
[30:12] fe016 | Wait . So you put the reference files ?
[30:15] fe016 | Or the ?
"[30:17] fe016 | No , I mean of the transcripts ."
[30:19] fe016 | Um .
"[30:22] fe016 | Well , we can talk about it off - line ."
[30:23] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:26] me011 | Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five ."
"[30:27] mn017 | D d So , does Washi - does does UW wanna u do this wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ?"
"[30:35] me018 | Uh , for recognition ."
[30:36] mn017 | Oh .
"[30:36] fe016 | I think they 're doing w didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts or ?"
[30:39] mn017 | Oh .
[30:40] mn017 | I see .
[30:41] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:46] fe008 | So , this is from one of the NSA meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is what it was changed to . So ,"
"[30:56] fe008 | And now the first one . "" OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting ."
"[31:03] fe008 | But , uh ,"
"[31:05] fe008 | really , um , it was "" we learned too much "" , which makes more sense syntactically as well ."
"[31:11] fe008 | Oh , this that 's the convention for indicating uncertain . So the transcriber was right ."
[31:12] me011 | U uncertains .
[31:14] mn017 | S
"[31:15] fe008 | You know , she was uncertain about that . So she 's right to be uncertain ."
[31:16] mn017 | OK .
[31:19] mn017 | Oh . OK .
"[31:19] fe008 | And it 's also a g a good indication of the of that . The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia and she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers ."
"[31:40] fe008 | And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that ."
"[31:44] fe008 | So instead of "" split upon unknown "" , it 's "" split in principle "" ."
[31:44] me011 | Yep .
"[31:47] me001 | Jane , these are from IBM ? The top lines ?"
[31:48] me011 | Spit upon ?
"[31:49] fe008 | No , no . These are these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings . The transcribers transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version ."
"[31:50] me011 | No , these are ours ."
[31:53] me001 | Oh .
"[31:56] me001 | Oh , I see ."
"[31:57] fe008 | My my checked version , after I go through it ."
[31:58] me001 | OK .
"[32:11] fe008 | especially those words , "" also "" and "" oder "" and some other ones . Those sneak in ."
[32:17] mn017 | Discourse markers .
[32:18] mn017 | Discourse markers .
[32:18] fe008 | S
"[32:20] fe008 | Sorry , what ?"
[32:23] mn017 | Yeah .
"[32:24] mn017 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[32:27] fe008 | uh , this is a term . The problem with terminology . Description with th the transcriber has "" X as an advance "" ."
"[32:33] fe008 | But really it 's "" QS in advance "" . I mean , I I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings ."
"[32:40] fe008 | uh , instead of "" from something - or - other cards "" , it 's "" for multicast "" ."
"[32:52] fe008 | And then , you can see here "" GPS "" was misinterpreted ."
"[33:09] fe008 | And it it comes through as "" in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core "" . Now this is a lot of terminology ."
[33:16] mn017 | Mmm .
"[33:16] fe008 | And they 're generally extremely good ,"
"[33:18] fe008 | but , you know in this this area it really does pay to , um to double check and I 'm hoping that when"
"[33:24] fe008 | the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the you know , there 're a lot of these in there ."
[33:31] mn017 | Yeah . So how often ?
"[33:31] me011 | Yeah , but I bet I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though ."
[33:35] me001 | Mmm .
"[33:36] me011 | Oh , really ? Uh , it 's Oh , so it 's just jargon ."
"[33:38] fe008 | It 's jargon . Yeah . I mean this is cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing ."
"[33:46] mn017 | But we don't I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . So ,"
"[33:51] mn017 | you know , un until you actually get a decent language model , @ @ Adam 's right . You probably won't notice a difference ."
[33:52] me013 | Yeah .
[33:55] me011 | It probably won't do any better .
"[33:57] mn017 | But it 's I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . I mean , obviously ."
[34:01] me013 | Yeah .
[34:12] me013 | Yeah .
[34:13] fe008 | OK .
"[34:17] me011 | Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,"
[34:20] fe008 | Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .
"[34:20] me011 | is that I was afraid people would say , "" let 's censor that because it 's wrong "" , and I don't want them to do that ."
[34:20] me013 | Yeah .
[34:23] me013 | Yeah .
[34:24] me013 | Yeah .
"[34:37] fe008 | I mean , I I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the the choice . We 'd originally chosen , uh ,"
[34:41] me011 | Yeah .
"[34:42] fe008 | very expensive head headsets but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um ,"
[34:49] fe008 | in this with this respect to this particular task .
"[34:54] fe008 | I don't know exactly , but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription . So it i we had every reason to think they would work . Sorry , what ?"
[34:56] me013 | Could be .
[34:58] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[34:58] mn017 | So you have spare headsets ?
[35:02] me011 | They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones .
[35:05] fe016 | Right .
"[35:07] mn017 | Um ,"
"[35:08] mn017 | because I , uh ,"
"[35:10] mn017 | I could use one on my workstation , just to t because sometimes I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to b go borrow it from"
"[35:18] fe008 | We have actua actually I have W Well , the thing is , that if we have four people come to work for a day , I was I was hanging on to the others"
"[35:24] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
"[35:25] fe008 | for , eh for spares , but I can tell you what I recommend ."
[35:28] mn017 | Right .
[35:29] me013 | Yeah . If you need it . Yeah .
"[35:30] me001 | Yeah , I still I still need to get a pair , too ."
[35:31] fe008 | It 'd just have to be a s a separate order an added order .
"[35:33] fe016 | We should order a cou uh , t"
[35:34] me001 | I 'm using one of these . Yeah .
"[35:36] mn017 | I think I have a pair that I brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening and it 's not Nnn . Yeah ."
[35:38] me013 | No . Just just just just buy them .
[35:39] fe016 | Sh - Just get the model number and Where do you buy these from ? Like ?
[35:41] me013 | Just buy them .
[35:42] mn017 | Yeah .
[35:44] fe016 | You just b go and b Oh .
[35:45] fe008 | Yeah . They always have them in stock .
[35:45] me013 | Yeah .
[35:46] fe016 | That 'd be a good idea .
"[35:47] me011 | W uh , could you email out the brand ?"
[35:47] me013 | Yeah .
"[35:49] fe008 | Oh , sure . Yeah . OK ."
[35:49] me011 | Cuz I think sounds like people are interested . So .
[35:50] me001 | Yeah .
[35:51] me001 | Definitely .
[35:51] me013 | Yeah .
[35:52] fe008 | It 's made a difference in in how easy . Yeah .
[35:54] me013 | I realized something I should talk about . So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ?
"[35:57] me011 | Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about"
[36:00] me011 | disk space yet again .
[36:01] me001 | Yeah .
"[36:02] me001 | u It 's short . I mean , if you wanna go , we can just throw it in at the end ."
"[36:04] me013 | No , no . Why don't you why don't you go ahead since it 's short ."
"[36:05] me001 | Um , well , uh ."
[36:13] me013 | I i i it i
"[36:15] fe016 | Sorry . See , if I had that little scratch - pad , I would have made an X there ."
"[36:20] me011 | Uh , well , we 'll give you one then ."
[36:22] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:29] me011 | Oh , no ."
"[36:29] me001 | Um , this is always a suspect phrase ."
"[36:38] me001 | o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gonna need a lot more We 're probably gonna need"
"[36:44] me001 | that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . But ,"
[36:49] me013 | We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes .
"[36:55] me013 | Well , we 're getting three thirty thirty - sixes ."
[36:56] fe016 | So .
[36:57] me001 | OK .
[36:57] me013 | Right ? That are going into the main f file server . So .
[36:58] fe016 | OK .
[36:59] me018 | Markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon .
[36:59] me011 | Soon ?
"[37:01] me001 | Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like ,"
"[37:05] me001 | the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer ."
[37:08] me001 | Or we can move them .
[37:11] me011 | No .
[37:11] mn017 | Or extra disk ?
[37:11] me011 | Ne - new disks .
"[37:12] me013 | Onto Abbott , the file server ."
[37:13] me001 | So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ? OK . That 's fine .
"[37:13] mn017 | Oh , oh . OK ."
[37:16] me011 | Once they come in . Sure .
"[37:16] fe016 | Uh , i"
[37:17] fe016 | Do when when is this planned for roughly ?
[37:22] me001 | OK .
[37:25] me011 | But I I vacillate between no space free and a few gig free . So .
[37:28] fe016 | Yeah .
"[37:28] me001 | Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out . That was the only thing I wanted to bring up ."
[37:31] me011 | OK .
[37:35] me001 | OK .
[37:35] me013 | So there 's another hundred gig . So .
[37:37] me001 | Alright . Great .
[37:37] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[37:37] me013 | OK .
[37:38] me001 | That 's it .
[37:39] fe016 | Good .
"[37:40] me011 | Yeah . A hundred gig here , a hundred gig there . It 's eventually"
[37:44] me013 | Yeah .
[37:45] me011 | real disk space .
[37:46] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:54] me011 | Oh , yeah ."

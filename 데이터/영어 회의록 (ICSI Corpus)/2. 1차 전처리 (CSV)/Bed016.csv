"[00:00] me010 | I , uh , had some communications with him"
"[00:01] fe004 | Ah , so comfortable ."
[00:02] me045 | Smooth .
"[00:05] me010 | yesterday or the day before . So , he doesn't plan on coming real soon , but he is taking"
[00:11] me010 | sabbatical this year and so he 'll probably come for six weeks at some point .
[00:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[00:15] fe004 | Good .
"[00:15] fe004 | I know that he 's going to like , Taiwan and other places to eat . So ."
[00:17] me010 | @ @ Right .
[00:19] fe016 | Everyone So are your microphones on ? Make sure to turn the batteries the switch on . Everybody ?
[00:23] fe004 | Yep . Yep . Bye .
[00:23] fn050 | Yeah .
[00:23] fe016 | OK . Great . Thanks very much .
[00:31] me003 | You a
[00:33] me003 | You 're you remember you 're being recorded at this point .
[00:35] me010 | Yeah .
"[00:36] fe004 | Oh , yeah , so , w we didn't yet specify with whom . But um ."
[00:37] me010 | Right .
"[00:38] me010 | Uh , right . Uh ."
[00:40] fe004 | So that 's why Keith and I are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting .
[00:40] me045 | Huh .
"[00:42] me045 | Yeah , I 'm just gonna sit here and"
[00:44] me045 | growl .
"[00:53] me045 | For which we thank you , by the way . I know you were you were doing that , but , anyway ."
[00:56] me010 | Right .
"[00:58] me003 | Oh yeah , how di how d exactly did , uh , that paper lead to anti - lock brakes ?"
[01:07] fe004 | What ?
"[01:09] me045 | Yeah , it 's a great story ."
[01:12] mn015 | OK .
"[01:19] mn015 | Oh yeah , um , Liz suggested we could start off by uh , doing the digits all at the same time ."
[01:25] fe004 | What ?
"[01:25] me003 | All at the same time . I don't know if I would get distracted and confused , probably ."
[01:27] me010 | e
"[01:28] fe004 | Really ? Do we have to like , synchronize ?"
"[01:29] me010 | Well , I think you 're supposed to OK . We can do this . Everybody 's got different digits , right ?"
[01:29] me045 | Are you being silly ?
[01:31] me003 | Oh wait do we have t
[01:33] mn015 | Yep .
[01:34] fe004 | You 're kidding .
[01:35] me010 | No .
"[01:35] mn015 | No , no , just just start whenever you want ."
"[01:37] me010 | e yeah , the"
[01:37] me045 | Alright .
[01:42] me045 | Alright .
"[01:42] me010 | yeah , there 's separate channels ."
[01:43] mn015 | Yeah .
[01:43] fe004 | OK .
[01:44] me010 | So when I say
[01:44] me045 | Just plug one ear .
[01:44] mn015 | Yeah .
[02:31] me010 | OK .
"[02:31] me045 | OK , bye ! That was a great meeting !"
[02:39] me003 | Alright .
[02:41] mn015 | Just to save time .
[02:43] me045 | OK .
[02:44] mn015 | Does matter for them .
[02:52] me010 | No .
[02:55] me003 | It 's strangely satisfying .
[02:56] fe004 | Yeah . It 's a ritual .
[03:15] mn015 | We could .
[03:15] me003 | true ?
[03:17] fe004 | We are ?
[03:18] mn015 | We might .
[03:18] fe004 | OK .
"[03:24] me003 | Oh yes , and that too ."
"[03:25] mn015 | Not not rehearse , I mean , I have just not spent any time on it , so I can show you what I 've got , get your input on it , and maybe some suggestions , that would be great ."
[03:35] mn015 | And the same is true for the proposal .
"[03:39] mn015 | I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains . So ,"
[03:48] mn015 | um .
[03:49] mn015 | I don't know how
[03:52] fe004 | I haven't looked at it
"[03:53] fe004 | yet ,"
[03:54] mn015 | but you could always send me comments per electronic mail
[03:56] fe004 | but I will .
[03:59] mn015 | and they will be incorporated .
[04:01] fe004 | OK .
"[04:04] mn015 | It basically says , well"
"[04:08] mn015 | "" this is construal "" , and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general , domain - general rules"
"[04:21] mn015 | how things are construed , and then the idea is to use ontology , situation , user , and"
[04:28] mn015 | discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what
[04:39] fe004 | Hmm .
[04:41] mn015 | in our beloved tourism domain .
"[04:50] me045 | I think I need a copy of this , yes . I is there an extra copy around ?"
[04:50] fe004 | Sorry .
[04:52] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[04:53] me003 | OK , we can we can we can pass pass my , uh we can pass my extra copy around . Er , actually , my only copy , now that I think about it , but . I already read half of it , so it 's OK ."
[04:53] fe004 | Uh . He sent it .
[04:57] fe004 | OK . You can keep it .
[04:57] me045 | Alrigh -
[04:59] fe004 | OK .
[05:01] me045 | OK .
"[05:07] me010 | Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . Yep ."
[05:11] mn015 | Yeah .
"[05:13] me003 | Oh , maybe the version I didn't have"
[05:15] me003 | that I mine the w did the one you sent on the email
[05:19] me010 | Yeah .
[05:20] me003 | That was the most recent one ?
"[05:22] me010 | Uh , yeah , I think so ."
[05:23] me003 | OK .
[05:23] mn015 | Yep .
[05:24] me003 | Cuz I read halfway but I didn't see a castle thing .
"[05:29] fe004 | Just so you know . But , anyway ."
"[05:30] mn015 | Yeah , um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from Yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d"
[05:35] fe004 | Oh .
"[05:36] fe004 | Oh , sorry ."
[05:40] fe004 | Sorry .
[05:41] mn015 | current formalism thing that you presented .
[05:41] fe004 | OK . I will . OK . OK .
[05:45] fe004 | OK .
"[05:53] fe004 | That 's not even ready , so . Um , OK ! Go on t to , uh , whatever ."
[06:05] mn015 | And any type of comment whether it 's a spelling or a syntax or
[06:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:10] me045 | There 's only one "" S "" in "" interesting "" ."
[06:12] mn015 | Hmm ?
[06:16] mn015 | Interesting .
[06:18] fe004 | Anyway .
[06:25] fe004 | The twenty - first ?
[06:26] mn015 | Twenty - ninth .
"[06:26] me010 | No , this is the twenty - first ."
"[06:27] me003 | What , today 's the twenty - first ? Oh , man !"
"[06:28] me045 | Well , better hurry up then !"
[06:31] mn015 | The twenty - ninth .
"[06:31] fe004 | Before the twenty - ninth , OK ."
[06:33] me003 | OK .
[06:38] mn015 | That 's when I 'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to
[06:41] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[06:42] mn015 | sell him this idea .
[06:47] fe004 | OK .
[06:51] mn015 | OK ?
"[06:53] mn015 | Then I 'm also going to present a little talk at EML ,"
[07:01] mn015 | about
[07:03] mn015 | what we have done here
[07:05] mn015 | and
[07:07] mn015 | so
"[07:09] mn015 | of course , I 'm I 'm gonna start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um ,"
[07:18] mn015 | then I 'm
[07:22] mn015 | asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in Heidelberg and someone asks them
[07:26] mn015 | in the morning The Cave Forty - Five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time .
[07:34] me045 | OK .
[07:34] mn015 | And so
"[07:37] mn015 | they 're supposed to imagine that , you know ,"
"[07:39] mn015 | do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? Uh ,"
"[07:45] mn015 | which is probably not , uh , the case"
"[07:49] mn015 | in that discotheque example , or in the Bavaria example , you just want to know where it is ."
"[07:56] mn015 | And so forth . So basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine nine PM in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example ,"
[08:06] mn015 | one that might ask for directions instead of just location .
"[08:11] mn015 | Um , and so forth and so forth . That 's sort of motivating it ."
"[08:16] mn015 | Then what have we done so far ? We had our little bit of , um ,"
"[08:25] mn015 | um , everth"
"[08:29] mn015 | That 's the not the construction parser . That 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , and"
[08:31] me045 | OK .
[08:33] fe004 | Easy parser .
[08:34] me045 | OK .
"[08:40] mn015 | That 's done . You have to change those strategies , right ? That 's , ten words ?"
[08:41] me003 | OK .
[08:43] me003 | Yeah .
"[08:45] me003 | Well , i it , you know ."
[08:48] me003 | Maybe twelve .
[08:49] mn015 | Twelve ? OK .
"[08:58] mn015 | That 's all about that . Then I 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about uh , actually I have an example ,"
[09:06] mn015 | probably .
[09:08] mn015 | Two s
[09:11] mn015 | Can you hear that ? Or should I turn the l volume on .
[09:12] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[09:14] fe004 | I could hear it .
[09:14] me003 | I I can hear it .
[09:15] me045 | I heard it .
[09:19] me003 | well maybe they will . I don't know .
[09:27] fe901 | Where is a nightclub ?
"[09:30] fe004 | This was an actual , um , subject ? Ah ."
[09:32] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[09:33] me045 | Sounds like Fey .
"[09:35] mn015 | But they 're they 're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer , the you can observe that all the time , they 're trying to match their prosody onto the"
"[09:37] me045 | Oh , OK ."
[09:40] me045 | Oh really .
[09:43] me045 | Interesting .
[09:44] mn015 | machine .
[09:48] xe902 | A popular disco is the Young Ganz .
"[09:56] me045 | Oh , it 's pretty slow ."
[09:58] fe901 | Where is it ?
[10:08] xe902 | In order to get there take bus number forty - two towards the @ @ and exit at the birdband .
[10:14] fe901 | OK .
[10:23] fe004 | Wh -
[10:23] me045 | The system breaking .
[10:24] fe004 | What is the s ? Oh !
[10:29] fe901 | Hello ? Hello ?
"[10:32] fe046 | I 'm sorry . Something seems to have gone wrong with our system . So , I 'm going to have to take over from here . What can I help you with ?"
[10:38] fe901 | Uh . I 'm looking for the University .
"[10:43] fe046 | OK . @ @ I can get the address , or if you know where you are , I can tell you how to get there ."
[10:49] fe901 | The address would be fine .
[10:50] fe046 | It 's at the Hauptstrasse and @ @ gasse .
[10:54] fe901 | Is that anywhere near the castle ? @ @
[10:57] mn015 | OK . And so forth and so forth .
"[11:00] mn015 | Um , I will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um ,"
"[11:12] mn015 | I 'm not gonna put in the figures from Liz , but I thought it would interesting to , uh ,"
"[11:17] mn015 | um , point out that it 's basically the same ."
"[11:22] mn015 | Um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d"
"[11:31] mn015 | quite different from , uh , some first , uh ,"
[11:35] mn015 | observations .
[11:37] mn015 | Then
"[11:43] mn015 | how to get there , what"
[11:45] mn015 | actually is happening
"[11:48] mn015 | there today ,"
"[11:50] mn015 | and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit as much as I can about the NTL story ."
"[12:03] mn015 | I 'm not quite sure about this , whether I should put this in ,"
"[12:07] mn015 | um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps"
"[12:15] mn015 | of people envisioning how language understanding works ,"
"[12:22] mn015 | talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude ,"
[12:30] mn015 | I 'll talk about monkeys in Italy .
"[12:34] mn015 | And , um , Srini was gonna send me some slides but he didn't do it , so from but I have the paper , I can"
"[12:43] mn015 | make a resume of that , and then I stole an X - schema from one of your talks I think ."
[12:48] fe004 | Oh .
"[12:49] fe004 | I was like , "" where 'd you get that ? "" OK . "" Looks familiar . """
"[12:51] me045 | Yeah , that looks familiar ."
"[12:54] mn015 | I think that 's Bergen , Chang , something , or the other ."
[12:57] fe004 | Uh .
[12:57] me010 | Whatever .
[12:59] fe004 | OK .
"[12:59] mn015 | Um , and that 's now I 'm not going to bring that . So that 's basically what I have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes ."
"[13:08] mn015 | So X - schemas , then , I would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes - net ."
[13:16] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[13:17] mn015 | End of story .
[13:26] mn015 | Anything I forgot that we should mention ?
"[13:32] mn015 | Oh , maybe the FMRI stuff . Should I mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ?"
"[13:43] fe004 | You might just wanna like , tack that on , as a comment ,"
"[13:46] me010 | Right , um ."
[13:47] fe004 | to something .
"[13:48] mn015 | "" Future activities "" something ."
"[13:50] me010 | Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons ,"
"[13:55] me010 | then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking and , you know , the yeah , yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent"
[14:02] mn015 | Yeah .
[14:13] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:13] me010 | and that we 're planning to do this , um ,"
"[14:17] me010 | which , we are ."
[14:19] me010 | So that 's one thing . Um .
"[14:23] me010 | Depends . I mean , there is"
"[14:26] me010 | a , um , whole language learning story ,"
"[14:31] me010 | OK ? which ,"
"[14:33] me010 | uh , actually , i i"
"[14:34] me010 | even on your five - layer slide , you you 've got an old one that that leaves that off ."
"[14:40] mn015 | Yeah , I I I do have it here ."
[14:43] fe004 | Hmm .
[14:43] me010 | Yeah .
[14:44] mn015 | Um .
[14:49] me010 | Right .
[14:53] mn015 | But I don't think I I am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter .
"[14:58] mn015 | I mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism"
"[15:04] mn015 | story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people how what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning"
"[15:15] me010 | OK , so , so anyway , I I agree that 's not"
[15:18] me010 | central . What
[15:19] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[15:20] me010 | you might wanna do
"[15:21] me010 | is , um ,"
"[15:25] me010 | and may not , but you might wanna this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the"
"[15:32] me010 | anal there the there we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas , and ,"
"[15:40] me010 | um , how the construction and simulation that ho that whole th"
"[15:44] mn015 | Yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the X - schema slide , so basically I 'm gonna steal that from Nancy , one of Nancy 's st"
"[15:48] fe004 | OK , right ."
"[15:52] fe004 | OK , I can give you a more recent if you want well , that might have enough ."
"[15:55] mn015 | Uh , I yeah , but I also have stuff you trash you left over , your quals and your triple - AI ."
[15:58] me010 | OK .
[16:02] me010 | The quals w the the the quals slides would be fine .
[16:05] fe004 | Yeah .
"[16:05] me010 | You could get it out of there , or some"
"[16:06] fe004 | Which I can even email you then , you know , like there probably was a little few changes , not a big deal ."
"[16:12] fe004 | Yeah , you could steal anything you want , I don't care ."
"[16:18] mn015 | Well , I I don't feel bad about it at all because because you are on the , uh , title . I mean on the the , you 're that 's see , that 's you ."
"[16:20] fe004 | No , you shouldn't ."
"[16:23] fe004 | Oh , that 's great , that 's great . I 'm glad to see propagation ."
[16:23] me010 | Yeah .
[16:25] me010 | Yeah .
[16:27] fe004 | Mmm .
"[16:30] fe004 | It 's it 's certainly related , um ,"
"[16:33] mn015 | I mean I might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Leipzig , so ."
"[16:42] mn015 | Because , um , EML is building up a huge thing in Leipzig ."
[16:43] fe004 | might wanna say .
[16:47] fe004 | Is it ?
"[16:50] me010 | Yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building ."
[16:55] me010 | Yeah .
[16:56] mn015 | Yeah .
"[16:58] me010 | The yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars ,"
[17:02] me010 | y you can do
"[17:06] me003 | Wait , they 're building a"
[17:07] fe004 | What ?
"[17:08] me003 | building in the shape of DNA , is that what you said ?"
"[17:10] me010 | Roughly , yeah ."
"[17:12] me010 | Including cr cross - bridges , and"
[17:12] fe004 | O
[17:14] fe004 | What ?
[17:20] me010 | You d you really now I I spent the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story
[17:26] fe004 | Of
"[17:26] me003 | Y You definitely wanna w don't wanna waste that money on research , you know ?"
[17:27] fe004 | what the building ?
[17:29] me010 | Right .
[17:31] me003 | That 's horrible .
[17:32] me010 | Right .
"[17:32] me010 | Well , no , no , y"
[17:33] me010 | i there 's infinite money . See you th you th you then fill it with researchers .
[17:38] fe004 | And give them more money . They just want a fun place for them to to work .
[17:39] me010 | Right .
[17:41] me010 | Right .
"[17:44] mn015 | Well , the the offices are actually a little the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in in the glass half - dome ."
[17:55] fe004 | Really ?
[17:59] me010 | Yeah .
[18:01] fe004 | Does it exist yet ?
[18:01] me010 | Yeah .
"[18:02] mn015 | Uh , as a model ."
[18:02] fe004 | They are w now building it ?
[18:04] fe004 | Hmm .
[18:05] mn015 | But I th
"[18:06] me010 | So , yeah , I think that 's that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh ,"
"[18:11] me010 | a lot of the this is interacting with ,"
"[18:15] me010 | uh , people in Italy but also definitely the people in Leipzig"
[18:19] me010 | and
"[18:25] me010 | the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah ."
[18:32] me010 | OK .
"[18:34] me010 | Anyway ! Enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal ."
"[18:38] mn015 | Yeah , if somebody has something to say ."
[18:40] me010 | Yep .
"[18:44] me045 | You might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh ,"
"[18:49] me045 | misspells in your slides , there . Like I believe you had "" Jackendorf "" ."
[18:54] me010 | Um .
"[18:55] me045 | Uh , unless there 's a person called "" Jackendorf "" , yeah ."
"[18:57] me010 | No , no , no ."
[18:57] fe004 | On that one ?
[19:00] me045 | But that 's the only thing I noticed in there .
[19:03] fe004 | In the presentation ?
[19:03] me045 | In the presentation .
"[19:04] fe004 | I 'll probably I c might have I 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . Anyway ."
"[19:08] mn015 | Oh , in the presentation here . I was ac actually worried about bibtex . Uh . No , that 's quite possible ."
"[19:09] fe004 | Yeah , that 's what he was talking about ."
[19:09] me045 | Yeah .
[19:15] mn015 | That 's copy and paste from
[19:17] mn015 | something .
"[19:21] me010 | So I did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet ."
"[19:29] me010 | Well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place Oh , did you put in something about ,"
"[19:35] fe004 | Metonymy and metaphor here , right ?"
"[19:36] me010 | uh , the individual ,"
[19:39] me010 | we 'd talked about putting in something
"[19:41] me010 | about people had ,"
"[19:44] me010 | uh Oh yeah , OK ."
[19:49] me010 | Good . I see where you have it .
[19:55] me010 | So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence .
[19:57] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:59] me010 | But ,"
"[20:01] me010 | what I meant is ,"
"[20:04] me010 | I think even before you give this ,"
"[20:08] me010 | to Wahlster ,"
"[20:11] me010 | uh , you should ,"
"[20:17] me010 | unless you put it in the text , and I don't think it 's there yet , about we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um ,"
[20:27] me010 | combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism . Is that in there ?
"[20:32] mn015 | Yeah , mmm . Um ."
"[20:33] me010 | Uh , OK , so where where is it , cuz I 'll have to take a look ."
"[20:44] mn015 | um , it 's just underneath , uh ,"
"[20:47] mn015 | um ,"
[20:48] mn015 | that reference to metaphor . So it 's the last paragraph
"[20:53] mn015 | before two . So on page two ,"
"[20:56] me010 | Uh , OK ."
[20:58] me010 | Yeah .
"[21:07] fe004 | That 's not about that , @ @ is it ?"
[21:08] mn015 | Yeah .
"[21:10] me010 | it s says it but it doesn't say it doesn't it d it d yeah , it doesn't give the punch line ."
[21:16] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:17] me010 | Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is , because it 's actually important ,"
"[21:23] me010 | which is , that ,"
[21:26] me010 | the
"[21:27] me010 | constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing ,"
"[21:34] me010 | uh , are ,"
"[21:36] me010 | in a way , quite general"
[21:42] me010 | but
[21:45] me010 | cover only base cases . And
[21:49] me010 | to make them apply
"[21:51] me010 | to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism ,"
"[21:58] me010 | of construal . And the punch line is , he claimed ,"
[22:03] me010 | that
"[22:05] me010 | if you do this right , you can get"
"[22:08] me010 | essentially orthogonality , that"
[22:10] me010 | if you introduce a new construction
"[22:13] me010 | at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work ."
[22:19] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:23] me010 | And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor ,"
[22:27] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[22:28] me010 | it should then
"[22:29] me010 | uh , compose with all of the constructions ."
[22:33] me045 | Yeah .
[22:36] me010 | And it to the extent that that 's true then then
[22:38] me010 | it 's a big win over anything that exists .
[22:55] me003 | So does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your
[22:58] me003 | context - free grammar
[22:59] me003 | you just have
[23:01] me003 | these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them .
[23:05] me045 | Yeah .
[23:06] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:11] me010 | So that , you know , for example ,"
"[23:14] me010 | uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct"
"[23:17] me010 | idea of a source , path , and goal"
[23:20] me010 | and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you
[23:25] me010 | can do the same grammar .
[23:27] me010 | And it is the same grammar .
[23:27] me003 | Mmm .
"[23:29] me010 | But ,"
[23:34] me010 | the way the construction 's written
[23:36] me010 | it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container .
"[23:41] me010 | Well , "" trouble "" isn't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container ."
[23:45] me003 | Right .
"[23:47] me010 | that 's where this , um ,"
[23:50] me003 | So with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule .
[23:53] me010 | Right .
"[23:59] me010 | it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the"
"[24:03] me010 | thesis proposal as it stands doesn't ,"
"[24:07] me010 | um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could ."
"[24:12] mn015 | No , it doesn't say it at all . No ."
"[24:32] mn015 | One could argue what if there are basic cases , even ."
"[24:37] mn015 | I mean , it seems like nothing is context - free ."
"[24:41] me010 | Oh , nothing is context - free ,"
"[24:43] me010 | but there are basic cases . That is ,"
"[24:46] me010 | um , there are physical containers , there are physical paths , there you know , et cetera ."
"[24:59] me010 | Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous . I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed"
[25:00] mn015 | Mmm . Yeah .
[25:04] me045 | Uh - huh .
"[25:04] me010 | you know as as a obstacle , or as some physical object . So there are multiple construals ."
[25:11] me010 | And in fact that 's part of what has to be done . This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis
[25:15] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[25:16] me010 | and the construal .
[25:18] mn015 | Yep .
[25:18] me010 | The b the the double arrow .
[25:19] mn015 | Yep .
"[25:20] me010 | So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make"
[25:23] me010 | ambiguity go away .
[25:24] mn015 | No .
"[25:28] me010 | But it does say that ,"
"[25:30] me010 | uh , if"
"[25:32] me010 | you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe"
[25:35] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[25:36] me010 | as an obstacle .
[25:38] me010 | And if that 's not consistent with
"[25:40] me010 | other things , then"
[25:42] me010 | you 've gotta reject that reading .
[25:44] mn015 | Yep .
"[25:45] me003 | You con you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so I thought , "" Why would he walk into the cafe and then"
"[25:50] me003 | somehow break his nose ? "" uh ,"
[25:53] me010 | Right .
[26:02] me010 | Yeah .

"[26:40] me010 | But Like , "" run into an old friend "" ,"
[26:43] me010 | it

[27:46] fe004 | OK .
"[27:49] me010 | OK , so , um ,"
[27:51] me010 | anything else you want to ask us about
[27:55] me010 | We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it .
[28:01] mn015 | the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for
"[28:07] mn015 | all of this ,"
"[28:08] mn015 | uh ,"
[28:10] mn015 | from our domain .
"[28:11] mn015 | So maybe if we w if we can make one up now , that would be c incredibly helpful ."
[28:16] me010 | OK .
"[28:19] fe004 | uh wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , I don't know , the related work stuff , as well as ,"
[28:25] me010 | Right right r
[28:25] fe004 | mappings ?
"[28:26] mn015 | w Well we have , for example , a canonical use of something and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use"
[28:39] mn015 | that 's also relevant to the to the domain .
"[28:41] me010 | OK , f let 's let 's suppose you use "" in "" and "" on "" ."
"[28:46] me010 | I mean , that 's what you started with ."
[28:48] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:48] me010 | So "" in the bus "" and "" on the bus , "" um , that 's actually a little tricky in English because to some extent they 're synonyms ."
[28:56] me010 | OK .
"[29:00] me010 | OK , what did he say ."
[29:05] mn015 | Um .
"[29:08] mn015 | "" On the bus "" is a m is a metaphorical metonymy"
[29:12] mn015 | that relates some meta path metaphorically and you 're on on that path and
[29:21] me010 | Yeah .
[29:25] me010 | Yeah .
[29:28] me010 | Yeah .
"[29:31] mn015 | that 's , uh , what did I call it here , the transportation schema , something , where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , and you can be , you know ,"
[29:35] me010 | Yeah .
[29:37] me010 | Yeah .
[29:42] me010 | Right . So so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do . I mean you could do something much simpler
[29:42] mn015 | on the wagon .
[29:48] mn015 | Yeah .
"[29:51] mn015 | But it 's it 's unfortunately , this is not really something a tourist would ever say ."

"[29:56] me010 | Well , unless he was repairing it or something , but yeah ."
[29:57] mn015 | Yeah .
[29:58] mn015 | But um .
"[29:58] me010 | Uh , but OK ."
"[30:00] mn015 | So in terms of the this We had we had initially we 'd started discussing the "" out of film . """
[30:01] fe004 | I see .
[30:06] me010 | Right .
"[30:07] mn015 | And there 's a lot of "" out of "" analysis , so , um ,"
[30:09] me010 | Right .
"[30:17] fe004 | Yeah , it 's a little it 's , uh we 've thought about it before , uh t uh to use the examples in other papers , and it 's it 's a little complicated ."
"[30:25] me045 | Out of out of film , in particular ."
"[30:25] fe004 | Cuz you 're like , it 's a state of there 's resource , right , and like ,"
[30:28] me045 | Yeah .
"[30:30] fe004 | what is film , the state you know . You 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource ."
"[30:40] me045 | It 's yeah , I mean , but and plus the fact that there 's also s I mean , can you say , like ,"
[30:40] fe004 | I mean .
"[30:46] me045 | "" The film ran out "" you know , or , maybe you could say something like "" The film is out "" so like the the film went away from where it should be , namely with you , or something , right ? You know ."
"[30:56] me045 | The the film the film is gone , right ? Um ,"
"[31:01] me045 | I never really knew what was going on , I mean I I find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that "" I 'm out of film "" means that I have left the state of having film or something like that , but ."
[31:06] fe004 | It 's weird .
[31:11] me010 | Uh .
"[31:11] fe004 | Or , "" having "" is also , um , associated with location , right ? so if the film left , you know state is being near film ."
[31:15] me045 | Yeah . Yeah .
[31:18] mn015 | So running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere .
"[31:23] me010 | Or being out of something as , uh as well ."
"[31:26] me010 | So "" running out of it "" definitely has a process aspect to it ."
"[31:28] fe004 | Mm - hmm . But that 's from run , yeah ."
[31:28] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:28] me010 | So ,"

[31:31] fe004 | Yeah .
[31:35] me045 | Yeah .

[31:36] fe004 | Yeah . So th

[31:37] fe004 | That part is fine .
[31:39] me010 | Yeah .

[32:24] me010 | Right .
[32:25] me010 | OK .
[32:30] mn015 | There 's gonna be four

[32:35] fe004 | emphasis on the computational ? Or emphasis on the linguist ?
"[32:39] mn015 | More there 's going to be the just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists ."
"[32:46] me010 | No no no , but not for your talk . I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes it 's just for one guy ."
"[32:46] fe004 | Oh , OK ."
"[32:48] mn015 | Oh , the thesis ! That 's that 's computa should be very computational , and , uh , someth"
[32:52] fe004 | OK . So I would try to I would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff .
[32:53] me010 | Yeah .
[32:55] me045 | Yeah .
[32:56] me010 | Right .
[32:57] me045 | Totally weird stuff .
[33:02] me045 | Yeah .
[33:04] fe004 | Around ?
"[33:05] mn015 | No , it 's the bakery itself is it a building ? uh , that you want to go to ? or is it something to eat that you want to buy ?"
[33:07] fe004 | Oh .
"[33:09] fe004 | Oh , oh yeah . Yeah , we 've thought about that . Right . Right ."
"[33:16] fe004 | No . What ? "" Bakery "" can't be something you 're gonna eat ."
[33:20] me045 | Sh -
[33:22] me003 | It 's a speech - act .
[33:25] me010 | r Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view
[33:27] fe004 | Yeah .
"[33:28] me010 | the bakery as a p a place that that i for example , if y"
[33:31] fe004 | Where you can get baked goods .
"[33:32] me010 | Well th well , that 's one . You want to buy something ."
"[33:35] me010 | But the other is ,"
"[33:36] me010 | uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or ,"
[33:41] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:44] me010 | you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might"

"[33:49] me010 | be asking about the existence of a bakery that doesn't mean , "" I want to buy some baked goods . """
[33:55] fe004 | OK .
[33:55] me010 | But
"[33:57] me010 | um , those are interesting examples but it 's not clear that they 're mainly"
[34:02] me010 | construal examples .
[34:04] me045 | Yeah .
"[34:04] fe004 | So it 's a lot of pragmatics , there , that"
[34:06] mn015 | Mmm .
[34:06] me010 | There 's all sorts of stuff going on . So
[34:08] fe004 | might be beyond what you want to do .
[34:08] me010 | let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view
[34:11] me010 | of construal . So let 's first do
[34:14] me010 | a So the metonymy thing
[34:17] me010 | is
[34:23] fe004 | You mean the s
"[34:25] fe004 | You mean "" the steak wants to pay "" ?"
"[34:28] me010 | N no not that one , that 's that 's a the sort of"
"[34:30] me010 | background . This is the t uh , page five ."
[34:34] me003 | About Plato and the book ?
[34:36] me010 | No .
[34:36] fe004 | Oh . Um .
[34:36] mn015 | No .
[34:37] me045 | Onward .
[34:37] me010 | Just beyond that .
[34:38] fe004 | How much does it cost ?
[34:39] mn015 | Where is the castle ? How old is it ? How much does it cost ?
[34:39] me010 | Yeah .
[34:39] me045 | A castle .
[34:41] me003 | Oh .
[34:42] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[34:50] me010 | It 's not for sale .
[34:52] me010 | Uh .
[34:54] me010 | So
[34:57] mn015 | S
"[34:58] fe004 | Yeah , that 's good . u"
[35:00] mn015 | But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus . Huh .

[35:15] me010 | Yeah .
"[35:18] mn015 | Well , I mean , my argument here is it 's it 's it 's the same thing as "" Plato 's on the top shelf , "" I 'm con you know , th that you can refer to"

"[35:20] fe004 | Yeah , yeah , no , I I agree ."

[35:30] fe004 | Yeah .
"[35:32] mn015 | refer back to it , and so you can Castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say "" Where is the castle , how much does it cost ? """

[37:00] fe004 | Ah !
"[37:04] fe004 | Or like its developmental state or something like that , you could I guess you could get that ."
[37:07] me010 | Yeah .
[37:09] me010 | Um .
[37:09] fe004 | Um .
"[37:12] me045 | I mean , there 's also things like I mean , s um , I guess"
"[37:24] me045 | doesn't nece I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location , just give me a phone number and I 'll call them or something like that ?"
"[37:28] me010 | Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah ."
"[37:33] me010 | You know , "" Where could I learn its opening hours , "" or something ."
[37:35] me045 | Yeah .
[37:40] me010 | But that 's
[37:43] fe004 | Hmm .
[37:44] me010 | not metaphorical .
[37:46] me045 | Yeah .
"[37:48] me010 | So we 're thinking about , um ,"
"[37:50] me010 | or we could also think about ,"
"[37:58] me010 | How about "" I 'm in a hurry "" ?"
[38:04] fe004 | State .
"[38:09] me010 | It i But it 's a state and the the issue is ,"
[38:09] me045 | Hmm ?
"[38:12] me010 | is that it may be just a usage ,"
"[38:15] me010 | you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical , I don't know ."
[38:18] me045 | Mmm .
[38:20] fe004 | Right .
"[38:23] me010 | Yeah . Yeah , right ."
[38:27] me010 | Ah ! How about
"[38:28] me010 | I I I you know , "" I 'm in I 'm in a state of exhaustion "" ?"
"[38:32] me010 | or something like that , which a tourist w Huh ?"
[38:33] fe004 | Do you really say that ?
[38:35] fe004 | Would you really say that ?
"[38:36] me010 | A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , "" I 'm in overload . """
[38:39] me045 | Yeah .
[38:40] me010 | Tu - stur tourists will often say that .
"[38:43] me010 | Oh , you can do that ?"
[38:54] fe004 | There 're too there 're all sorts of fixed expressions I don't like uh
[38:57] me010 | Right .
"[39:02] mn015 | Well I when , uh just f u the data that I 've looked at so far that rec I mean , there 's tons of cases for polysemy ."
[39:07] me010 | Yeah .
[39:10] me010 | Right .
"[39:11] mn015 | So , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build you know , whatever ."
[39:11] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[39:16] me010 | Right .
"[39:19] mn015 | Um , so ib in mus for example , in museums , you know , as a building or as something where pictures hang versus , you know ,"
"[39:29] me010 | Right . As an institution , yeah ."
[39:31] mn015 | Um .
[39:35] fe004 | Why don't you want to use any of those ?
[39:36] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[39:38] mn015 | Yeah , well No , but this that 's what I have , you know , started doing ."
"[39:44] mn015 | Metonymy , polysemy ."
[39:44] me003 | I love Van Gogh .
[39:44] me010 | Yeah .
[39:48] me010 | Ah !
"[39:48] fe004 | "" I wanna go see the Van Gogh . """
"[39:57] mn015 | uh , can be made that ,"
"[40:00] mn015 | you know , despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain , because people interacting with HTI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical ,"
[40:05] me010 | Yeah .
"[40:11] mn015 | construal still is , uh , you know , completely ,"
"[40:14] mn015 | um , key in terms of finding out any of these things , so ,"
[40:18] me010 | Right .
[40:19] mn015 | um .
"[40:20] me010 | So that 's that 's that 's a that 's a reasonable point , that it in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy ."
"[40:27] mn015 | We , uh I with a I looked with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy ."
"[40:30] me010 | And polysemy , and stuff like that ."
[40:33] me010 | Yeah .
[40:36] mn015 | Hardly anything . So not even in descriptions
"[40:40] mn015 | w did we find anything , um ,"
[40:42] mn015 | relevant .
[40:44] me045 | I have to go .
[40:46] me010 | Alright . Yeah .
"[40:50] mn015 | But OK this is just something we 'll we 'll see , um ,"
[40:55] me010 | Right .
[40:56] me010 | s See you .
[41:01] mn015 | and deal with .
"[41:06] me010 | OK , well ."
"[41:09] me010 | I guess if anybody has additional suggestions , w Yeah ."
"[41:12] mn015 | I mean maybe the "" where is something "" question as a whole , you know , can be construed as , u i locational versus instructional request ."
"[41:20] mn015 | So , if we 're not talk about the lexic"
[41:21] fe004 | Location versus what ?
[41:23] mn015 | instruction .
[41:24] me010 | Sure .
[41:25] mn015 | Yeah .
[41:28] fe004 | definitely treated as an example of construal .
[41:31] fe004 | Right ? @ @
"[41:31] mn015 | Yeah but then you 're not on the lexical level , that 's sort of one level higher ."
[41:38] mn015 | But I don't need it .
"[41:41] me010 | Well , you might want both ."
[41:43] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[41:45] fe004 | Yeah .
[41:57] mn015 | just in the spatial domain are rare .
[42:01] me010 | But it 's it 's easy to make up plausible ones .
[42:05] me010 | You know .
"[42:07] me010 | Right , you know you know , where r Yeah ."
[42:11] me010 | What color was this in in
"[42:12] me010 | in the nain nineteenth century . What was this p instead of wh what you know how was this painted , what color was this painted , um ,"
[42:14] mn015 | Yeah .
[42:19] me010 | was this alleyway open .
"[42:22] mn015 | Yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run . We c we can show people pictures of objects and then"
[42:22] me010 | Uh .
[42:29] mn015 | have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth .
[42:34] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[42:43] me010 | OK . So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically .
[42:51] me010 | Wish you a good trip .
[42:54] me010 | All success .
[43:07] me003 | and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying ?
"[43:12] fe004 | first one , I think . The very very first one ."
[43:14] me003 | It was a very early one . I don't know if it 's the first one .
[43:29] fe004 | Mmm .
[43:50] fe004 | Mmm .

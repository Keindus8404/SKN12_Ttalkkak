[00:01] me013 | Hmm .
"[00:11] me011 | Well , I don't think No ."
"[00:12] me022 | No , uh , that that wasn't recorded ."
[00:21] me022 | Temple squeezers .
[00:21] fe016 | On your temple Yeah .
[00:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[00:28] me011 | But I definitely haven't figured it out .
"[00:35] fe041 | Um , Meeting Recorder meeting ."
[00:49] me025 | Yeah .
[00:50] me013 | Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live . OK .
[00:52] me025 | Yeah .
"[00:53] me013 | So , uh ,"
"[00:55] me013 | what were we gonna talk about again ? So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing ."
[00:58] fe016 | Were we gonna do digits ?
[00:59] fe041 | OK . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ?
[01:03] me025 | It 's a good idea .
[01:03] me011 | u
[01:09] me011 | it would take too much time .
"[01:10] fe016 | You can write them on the board , if you want ."
"[01:11] me011 | Yeah , but it takes too much time ."
[01:12] me025 | Mari ? Y I think your your your thing may be pointing in a funny direction .
[01:13] fe041 | What ?
[01:13] me013 | It 's not that long .
[01:16] me025 | Sort of it 's it helps if it points sort of upwards .
[01:20] me025 | Sort of it you know . Yeah .
[01:21] fe041 | Would it m
[01:22] me025 | So that thing the little th that part should be pointing upwards . That 's it . Yeah .
[01:22] me013 | w u
[01:29] me013 | as close to you your
[01:29] fe041 | Yeah . OK .
[01:30] me025 | That 's good . That kind of thing is good .
[01:32] fe041 | This w
[01:33] fe041 | Alright . How 's that working ?
[01:34] me013 | Yeah .
[01:36] me025 | It 's working .
[01:36] fe041 | OK .
"[01:38] me013 | Alright . So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection ,"
"[01:43] me013 | and , um , uh , you you put up there data format ,"
[01:48] fe041 | Um .
"[01:48] me013 | and other tasks during data collection ,"
"[01:51] fe041 | So , I think the goal the goal was"
"[01:58] fe041 | what can you add to it to get , um ,"
"[02:04] me011 | Uh , especially for querying ."
"[02:05] fe041 | Especially for querying . So , getting people to do queries afterwards , getting people to do summaries afterwards ."
[02:11] fe041 | Um .
"[02:17] fe008 | if he has s I I don't remember , Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ? La - Landay ?"
[02:20] me011 | Landay . James .
"[02:21] fe008 | So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk note - taking things ,"
[02:25] fe008 | then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit .
[02:25] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:30] fe041 | Well , if if you"
[02:30] fe008 | to do that .
[02:33] fe041 | actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes
[02:37] fe041 | in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps . So action item or
"[02:42] fe041 | uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah ."
[02:45] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[02:46] fe041 | So that wouldn't be a summary . That would just be that would b relate to the query side .
[02:50] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:54] me011 | write it down and mark it somehow , you know ."
"[02:57] me025 | Right . I mean , we because you 'd have several people with these pads , you could collect different things ."
[03:01] fe041 | Right .
"[03:05] me022 | I mean , the down - side to that is that he sort of indicated that the ,"
"[03:09] me022 | uh , quality of the handwriting recognition was quite poor ."
[03:16] me011 | But that 's alright .
[03:17] me011 | I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't
[03:21] me011 | pretty easily .
[03:22] fe041 | Yeah . We also could come up with some code for
[03:26] fe041 | things that people want to do so that for frequent things .
[03:30] me022 | Yeah .
"[03:31] fe041 | And the other things , people can write whatever they want . I mean , it 's to some extent ,"
"[03:36] fe041 | uh , for his benefit . So ,"
"[03:41] fe041 | if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful ."
[03:45] me022 | Right .
[03:48] me011 | Yeah .
[03:53] fe008 | The roll call .
[03:54] fe041 | Right . I thought you did that
[03:54] me013 | Roll call .
"[03:56] fe041 | on purpose . But anyway , shall we do the roll call ?"
"[03:57] me013 | No , not a No , I just My mind went elsewhere . So ,"
"[04:01] me013 | uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan ,"
[04:03] me013 | where am I ? I 'm on channel three .
[04:11] me025 | I 'm Dan Ellis .
[04:13] me022 | Eric on channel nine .
"[04:15] fe016 | Liz , on channel one ."
[04:21] fe008 | Should we have used pseudo - names ?
[04:22] fe008 | Should we do it a second time with pseudo No . No .
"[04:26] me011 | And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z Ms ?"
"[04:26] me025 | Let me , uh , turn that off ."
[04:29] me025 | Oh .
[04:34] me025 | Next one .
[04:35] fe008 | Next nearest .
[04:35] me011 | Far .
"[04:36] me025 | Furthest . PDM - right , PZA - right PDA - right , PDA - left ."
[04:41] fe008 | OK .
[04:42] me025 | Thanks .
"[04:43] me011 | Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table ,"
[04:53] me011 | So . You So we won't have to go through that .
[04:56] fe041 | Hmm .
"[04:59] fe008 | when you say "" Jimlet "" and the"
"[05:01] fe008 | person listening won't know what that is , sh shou"
"[05:04] fe008 | How how do we get Is that important information ? You know , the"
"[05:10] me013 | Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones . There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other"
[05:17] me013 | have in column common that we will not know .
[05:17] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[05:18] fe041 | Right .
[05:20] fe008 | OK .
[05:20] fe041 | Right . So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .
[05:23] me013 | Yeah .
[05:26] fe008 | OK .
"[05:27] me013 | I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design , and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us . So ."
"[05:36] me011 | Well , that was just one of the reasons . But , yeah , definitely ."
[05:37] me013 | Yeah .
[05:38] me013 | That that 's right . There were others of course . Yeah .
"[05:45] fe041 | So ,"
"[05:46] fe041 | uh , u u"
"[05:47] fe041 | So , actually there 's kind of three issues . There 's the CrossPad issue ."
"[05:55] fe041 | Um , do we have s people write summaries ?"
[05:58] fe041 | Everybody or one person ?
"[06:00] fe041 | And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ?"
[06:11] fe041 | Right .
[06:12] me022 | One thing I was thinking about was is that Dan said
"[06:15] me022 | earlier that , you know , maybe two weeks later , which is when you would want to query these things , you might ask them then ."
[06:19] fe041 | Right .
[06:21] me022 | But
[06:22] me022 | there 's a problem with that in that
"[06:26] me022 | If you don't have an interactive system , it 's gonna be hard to go beyond sort of the first level of question ."
[06:31] fe041 | Right .
[06:31] me022 | Right . And furth id explore the data further .
[06:34] fe041 | Right .
[06:34] me022 | So .
"[06:35] me013 | There 's there 's another problem which is , um ,"
"[06:37] me013 | we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder ."
"[06:43] me013 | And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group ,"
"[06:46] me013 | the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do ,"
[07:03] me013 | t See ? There we go .
[07:03] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:04] me011 | So , I I asked them to send me"
[07:06] me011 | ideas for queries after the meeting and no one ever did . I didn't follow up either .
"[07:11] me011 | So I didn't track them down and say "" please do th do it now "" . But , uh ,"
[07:11] fe041 | Yeah .
[07:15] me011 | no one spontaneously
[07:17] me013 | I
"[07:18] me013 | I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random ,"
[07:23] fe041 | Right .
"[07:23] me013 | uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing ."
[07:23] me025 | Right .
[07:27] fe041 | OK .
"[07:30] me011 | to actually listen to the meeting and say "" that 's important , that might be a query "" ."
"[07:34] fe008 | Tsk . Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , "" action item "" and things like that , which"
"[07:43] fe008 | could be used in ,"
"[07:45] fe008 | uh ,"
"[07:46] fe008 | t to some degree finding the structure . And and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to"
[07:46] fe041 | Yeah . W
"[07:50] fe008 | the n uh , note - taking ,"
[07:52] fe008 | the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later .
"[07:57] fe008 | And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards ,"
"[08:00] fe008 | um , I think they should be recorded instead of written"
"[08:03] fe008 | because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary ."
[08:11] fe041 | at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .
"[08:15] fe008 | Yeah , good . Good point . Yeah ."
[08:16] fe041 | And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?
"[08:20] me011 | I mean , that gives you a summary but it doesn't really How do you generate queries from that ?"
"[08:24] me025 | Well . But , I mean , maybe a summary is one of the things we 'd want from the output of the system . Right ?"
[08:25] fe008 | Yeah .
[08:28] fe041 | Right .
"[08:29] me025 | I mean , they 're something . It 's a a kind of output you 'd like ."
"[08:31] me011 | Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks . And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval"
[08:37] me011 | even if it 's sort of not full full - bore
[08:38] fe041 | Right .
[08:40] me011 | what I 'm gonna do for my thesis . I 'm gonna do something . I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization .
"[08:44] me011 | And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine , but it 's not gonna be me ."
"[08:52] me013 | issues nailed down ,"
[08:53] me013 | we need to do a bunch of recordings
[09:01] me013 | And then we 'll have some data there .
"[09:03] me013 | And then , i i we can start"
"[09:05] me013 | l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things and at the very least ."
[09:08] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:09] fe016 | I actually want to say something about the note pad . So ,"
[09:12] me013 | Hmm .
"[09:12] fe016 | if you could sense just when people are writing ,"
"[09:18] fe016 | be using that for other purposes , and each person has a note pad . They just get it when they come in the room ."
"[09:24] fe016 | Then you c you can just have a fff plot of wh you know , who 's writing when ."
[09:29] me025 | Activity . Yeah .
[09:33] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:35] fe016 | sort of the hot places where people are writing things down . I mean , you can tell when you 're in a meeting when everybody stops to write something down that something was just said . It may not be"
"[09:37] me011 | Oh , I see ."
[09:39] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:44] fe016 | kept in the later summary , but at that point in time is was something that was important ."
[09:49] fe008 | That 's a nice idea .
[09:50] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[09:51] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:56] me013 | Maybe I 'm missing something , but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?"
"[10:08] me011 | Uh , y"
"[10:13] fe041 | the queries per - se , but it does give us"
"[10:16] fe041 | an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say"
[10:22] fe016 | Yeah .
"[10:22] fe041 | "" what were the hot - points of the meeting ? """
"[10:24] me013 | That that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , um ,"
"[10:30] me013 | "" how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? "" ,"
[10:36] me013 | knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking .
[10:39] fe016 | But I bet it 's a good superset of it .
[10:40] me013 | Does it ?
"[10:43] fe041 | Well , yeah . I think you could say they 're gonna ask about ,"
"[10:48] fe041 | uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s"
[10:52] fe041 | talk about blah . And at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on .
[10:58] me013 | Maybe .
[11:01] fe041 | Right . It 'll tell you the hit but not the query .
[11:05] fe041 | Right .
[11:08] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:15] me013 | Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that because , you know , th what what what James"
[11:16] fe016 | Um .
"[11:32] me013 | where do I start ? """
"[11:33] fe041 | Well , th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,"
[11:36] me013 | OK .
"[11:37] fe041 | for a couple reasons . One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries ,"
[11:43] fe041 | you can do
[11:46] fe041 | a word frequency count and see what words come up
[11:50] fe041 | in different types of meetings .
"[11:52] fe041 | So "" action item "" is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever ."
[11:58] fe041 | So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .
[12:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:03] fe041 | Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run"
"[12:08] fe041 | a little pilot experiment with somebody saying "" here 's a summary of a meeting ,"
"[12:13] fe041 | what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? """
"[12:16] me011 | Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary ."
"[12:24] fe041 | That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,"
[12:28] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[12:28] fe041 | and you want to ask questions to get more detail .
"[12:31] me011 | th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . Well , it doesn't have to be ."
"[12:35] me011 | OK . So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about ,"
"[12:38] me011 | which is for someone else ,"
"[12:40] me011 | as opposed to as a remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought"
[12:45] me011 | in the information retrieval part of it would be .
"[12:48] me011 | But , uh ,"
"[12:50] me011 | I guess if you had a meeting participant ,"
[12:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[12:58] me011 | I don't know how to do it if until you have a system .
[13:01] me025 | Yeah .
[13:02] fe041 | Mmm .
"[13:04] me011 | Yeah , that that 's what I was saying ."
[13:04] fe041 | Yeah .
"[13:08] me025 | There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some"
"[13:12] me025 | in retrospect you think "" oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? """
"[13:16] me025 | And it 's something that didn't appear in the summary but you And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for ."
[13:17] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[13:21] fe041 | Right .
[13:21] fe016 | Right .
[13:21] me025 | Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded .
[13:22] fe041 | Right .
[13:31] fe016 | But you could always post - hoc label them .
"[13:33] me025 | Right , right . Exactly . But I mean , it 's difficult to sort of say "" and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? """
[13:34] fe016 | Yeah .
[13:35] fe016 | Yeah .
[13:39] me025 | Those aren't the kind of things that come up .
"[13:42] me025 | Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure ."
"[13:47] fe008 | important points of the of the meeting ,"
"[13:51] fe008 | y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection ,"
"[13:56] fe008 | you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , "" we discussed types of na data collection "" ."
"[14:05] fe008 | of the discourse , then"
[14:07] fe008 | if you can categorize what it is that you 're
[14:10] fe008 | looking for with reference to those l
"[14:11] fe008 | those larger headings , then you can find it even if you"
[14:14] fe008 | don't have a direct route to that .
[14:20] me011 | a high burden on the note - taker .
[14:22] me011 | That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take .
[14:29] fe041 | I th No . I think you got to have somebody
[14:29] fe016 | No ?
"[14:32] fe041 | who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker . Somebody who 's part of the meeting ."
[14:34] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:46] fe016 | And that way that one student has , you know , a rough idea of what was going on ,"
"[14:51] fe016 | and they can use it for their research . I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system ,"
[14:56] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:57] fe016 | because that that 's a lot of trouble and maybe it 's not the best way to do it .
[14:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[15:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[15:00] fe016 | But if he has some students that want to study that
"[15:03] fe016 | then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings , and"
[15:06] fe016 | get the notes from the note - taker or something .
[15:07] me011 | Right .
[15:08] me013 | Hmm .
"[15:14] me011 | they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it ."
[15:17] me011 | I think they 're done .
[15:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[15:19] me011 | Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on"
[15:22] me011 | notes . So what we 'd have to interest someone in
[15:25] me011 | is the combination of note and speech .
"[15:28] me011 | And so the question is "" is there such a person ? "" And I think right now , the answer is "" no "" ."
[15:32] me011 | We 'll just have to see .
"[15:39] me013 | now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable ,"
"[15:49] me013 | So I was I was just thinking about ,"
[15:53] me013 | w We have this collection of meeting . We have five hours of stuff .
"[15:56] me013 | Uh , we get that transcribed . So now we have five hours of meetings"
"[15:59] me013 | and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , "" Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? """
"[16:04] me013 | Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask . I 'd have to get started someplace . So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go "" oh , yeah , I was in that meeting ,"
"[16:12] me013 | I remember that ,"
[16:15] me013 | And and th I think that might
"[16:17] me013 | then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary ,"
[16:21] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[16:21] me013 | but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .
[16:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[16:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[16:35] me013 | Well , yeah . That 's true too ."
[16:37] me025 | Hmm .
"[16:37] me011 | Yeah , absolutely . Then you want to have it ."
"[16:37] fe041 | you know , it 's kind of a key ."
"[16:39] fe016 | So how does the summary get generated ? I 'm not against the idea of a summary , but"
"[16:41] fe041 | Well , i i ?"
[16:41] me011 | By hand .
[16:43] fe016 | I wanted to think carefully about who 's generating it and how because the summary will drive
"[16:44] fe041 | Or , d o"
"[16:53] fe041 | this one being different , but"
"[17:02] fe041 | Um , you can just make it be on a laptop , so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody you don't have to go through handwriting recognition ."
"[17:10] fe041 | Um , and then they post - edit it into ,"
"[17:15] fe041 | uh , a summary and they email it out for minutes . I mean , that happens in most meetings ."
[17:19] fe008 | I I I think
[17:25] me025 | Yeah .
[17:25] fe041 | Right .
"[17:25] fe008 | And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone "" what was the meeting about ? """
[17:25] fe016 | Yeah . OK .
[17:30] fe041 | Hmm .
"[17:38] fe008 | to have multiple people summarize it ,"
[17:46] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:46] fe008 | Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting ,"
"[17:49] fe008 | you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get ,"
"[17:52] fe008 | uh , with mult See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker because that 's just one person 's perception ."
"[17:58] fe008 | And , um ,"
[18:05] fe008 | major topics that they 're interested in .
[18:07] me013 | A
"[18:07] fe008 | So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and"
[18:11] fe041 | OK .
"[18:12] fe008 | a spontaneous oral summary afterwards , no longer than two minutes ,"
[18:16] fe008 | from multiple people .
"[18:18] me013 | you can correct me on this , but but , uh , my impression was that , uh ,"
[18:26] me011 | Never .
"[18:29] me011 | I mean , Dan is the one who who"
[18:30] me013 | I
[18:33] me025 | Yeah .
"[18:39] me011 | Oh , really ?"
"[18:40] me013 | Yeah , but those are bigger deal things . Right ? Where you 've got fifteen peo I mean , most th this is one of the larger meetings . Most of the meetings we have are"
[18:46] me011 | That 's true are four or five people .
[18:47] me013 | four or five people and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it . You just get together and talk about where you are .
[18:48] fe041 | Yeah .
"[18:50] fe041 | Right . So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting"
"[18:55] fe041 | or a technical discussion . And I agree , technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes ."
[18:55] me013 | Yeah .
[18:57] me013 | Yeah .
[19:00] me013 | Yeah .
[19:01] me013 | Yeah .
[19:04] me013 | Do they ?
[19:04] me011 | There 's uh a person with a laptop at each meeting .
[19:06] me025 | How many people are those meetings ?
"[19:08] me011 | There are more . I mean , there are ten - ish ."
[19:10] me025 | Yeah .
[19:12] me013 | Yeah .
[19:13] me011 | They 're very sparse .
[19:29] fe016 | Or you shou could tell people not to to use the boards . But there 's sort of this missing information otherwise .
[19:33] fe008 | I agree .
"[19:34] me011 | you you just you g end up with video ,"
"[19:37] me011 | and and instrumented rooms . And that 's a different project , I think ."
[19:40] me025 | f u
"[19:42] me025 | I think for this data capture , it would be nice to have a digital camera"
"[19:45] fe016 | Uh , y"
[19:50] fe016 | Right .
[19:50] fe008 | I agree . That 's wonderful .
[19:51] fe016 | Yeah . People who were never at the meeting will have a very hard time understanding it otherwise .
[19:51] me025 | for every meeting .
[19:52] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
[19:54] fe008 | I agree .
[19:55] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:56] me025 | Well , no . I mean , I I just think I mean , I think that right now we don't make a record of where people are sitting on the tables ."
[19:57] fe041 | Right .
[20:06] fe041 | Mmm .
[20:06] me011 | photographs adds a whole nother level of problems .
[20:07] me025 | Yeah .
[20:08] me025 | We -
[20:09] fe008 | It 's just a digital record .
[20:11] fe016 | I don't mean that you model it .
[20:14] fe016 | Like archiving it or storing it .
[20:15] me025 | Yeah .
"[20:15] fe008 | Yes , I agree ."
[20:17] fe008 | I agree .
"[20:17] fe008 | It 's i because discourse is about things , and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable ."
[20:17] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:20] fe016 | someone later might be able to take these and say "" OK , they , you know at least these are the people who were there and here 's sort of what they started talking about , and """
"[20:30] me013 | uh , L L"
[20:30] me013 | L
[20:31] fe008 | Just to archive .
"[20:32] me013 | u uh , Liz , you sa you sat in on the , uh ,"
[20:36] me025 | I 'll go and get the camera .
"[20:38] me013 | uh , on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the , uh that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was was having ."
"[20:46] me013 | So I I wasn't there . They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that ."
"[20:52] fe016 | Big , big interest ."
[20:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:54] fe016 | Huge . I mean , it personally , I don't I would never want to deal with it . But I 'm just saying"
[20:57] me013 | Yeah .
[20:59] fe016 | first of all there 's a whole bunch of
"[21:01] fe016 | fusion issues that DARPA 's interested in . You know , fusing gesture and face recognition , even lip movement and things like that ,"
[21:03] me013 | Yeah .
[21:08] fe016 | for this kind of task .
[21:10] fe016 | And there 's also
[21:13] fe016 | I think a personal interest on the part of Mark Liberman
[21:16] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:19] fe016 | in storing these images in any data we collect so that later we can do other things with it .
"[21:23] me013 | So so to address what what Adam 's saying , I mean , I think you uh , that"
[21:29] me013 | the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .
[21:33] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[21:34] me013 | And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it .
[21:41] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[21:42] me011 | But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part
"[21:45] me011 | to create it , and store it , and"
"[21:48] me011 | get all the standards , and to do anything with it ."
[21:52] me011 | Yeah .
"[21:53] fe016 | I think even doing something very crude Like I know with ATIS , we just had a tape recorder running all the time ."
[21:58] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:58] fe016 | And later on it turned out it was really good that you had a tape recorder of what was happening , even though you w you just got the speech from the machine ."
[22:10] me011 | Low fidelity . Yeah .
"[22:13] fe016 | of doing that , I think it would be worthwhile ."
[22:17] fe016 | Otherwise you 'd you lose it .
[22:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[22:28] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:31] me011 | Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier cuz you 'll Well , the wireless ."
[22:34] me013 | Yeah .
[22:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:42] fe016 | And they have said , I talked to the student who had done this , that with two"
[22:48] fe016 | fairly inexpensive cameras they they just recorded all the time and were able to get all the information from or maybe it was three from all the parts of the room .
[22:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:06] me011 | I I I don't disagree . I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database ."
[23:07] fe016 | at all .
[23:12] me011 | The problem with it is
[23:13] me011 | you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .
"[23:17] me011 | So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say "" I won't participate "" ."
[23:18] fn043 | Mmm . That 's true .
[23:22] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:29] fe008 | Well , there 's that 'd be the the parallel , yeah . But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards ,"
[23:35] fe016 | Yeah . I definitely won't participate if there 's a camera .
[23:44] fe008 | It 's just one snapshot . We 're not talking about a movie . We 're talking about a snapshot .
[23:48] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[23:51] fe008 | Yeah .
[23:51] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[23:52] fe016 | they just turn on these cameras . They were they were not moving or anything .
[23:57] me025 | It 's on its way .
[23:58] fe016 | And stored it on analog media .
[23:59] me011 | Hmm ?
[24:00] me025 | It 's coming .
"[24:01] fe016 | And they they didn't actually align it or anything . They just they have it , though ."
[24:12] me022 | or just put it on videotape ?
"[24:13] fe016 | I think they just had the videotapes with a c you know , a counter or something . Um ,"
[24:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[24:18] fe016 | I 'm not sure .
"[24:20] me013 | we we might try that some and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that ,"
"[24:25] me013 | uh , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think ."
[24:27] fe016 | Yeah .
[24:27] fe008 | Th -
"[24:36] fe016 | If LDC collects this data u I mean , and L - if Mark Liberman is a strong proponent of how they collect it and what they collect ,"
[24:45] fe016 | there will probably be some video data in there .
[24:47] me013 | There you go .
[24:48] fe016 | And so that could argue for us not doing it or it could argue for us
[24:52] fe016 | doing it . The only place where it sort of overlaps is when
"[24:55] fe016 | some of the summarization issues are actually could be ,"
"[24:58] fe016 | um , easier made easier if you had the video ."
[25:01] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:11] me013 | if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to , uh , and and will include all that ."
[25:19] me013 | I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up . I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it .
[25:19] fe041 | e
"[25:24] me013 | In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all . And so"
[25:29] me013 | I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing
[25:33] me013 | of the stuff that we 're doing .
"[25:37] me013 | we might want to look at at some some , uh , subsets of that . Like"
[25:44] fe008 | Yeah .
"[25:45] fe016 | Or at least make sure that the note - taker takes a sh you know , a snapshot of the board ."
"[25:51] fe016 | That 'll make it a lot easier for meetings that are structured . I mean , otherwise later on if nobody wrote this stuff on the board down we 'd"
[25:52] fe008 | Exactly .
[25:53] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[25:58] fe016 | have a harder time summarizing it or agreeing on a summary .
"[26:01] fe008 | Especially since this is common knowledge . I mean , this is shared knowledge among all the participants , and it 's a shame to keep it off the recording ."
[26:09] fe008 | s
[26:15] me013 | Yeah .
[26:18] me011 | The point is that we 're not saving it anyway .
[26:21] me011 | Right ? In in our real - life setting .
"[26:28] me011 | Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it ."
"[26:31] fe016 | Right . That would be the other alternative , to make sure that anything that was on the board ,"
[26:32] fe041 | Yeah .
"[26:35] fe016 | um , is in the record ."
"[26:39] fe041 | would be I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking ,"
[26:51] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:53] fe041 | I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting ."
"[26:57] fe041 | Um ,"
"[26:58] fe041 | so so we won't worry about requiring these things , but the more things that we can get it for ,"
[27:03] fe041 | the more useful it will be for various applications .
[27:07] fe041 | So .
"[27:08] me013 | So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do ,"
[27:22] me013 | from from today ? OK .
[27:25] me013 | So .
"[27:39] me013 | uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that . Right ? And then the next thing"
[27:43] me013 | we talked about was the was the summaries
[27:47] me013 | and are we gonna do anything
[27:50] me013 | about that .
"[27:54] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[27:56] fe041 | So , if I 'm collecting data"
[27:58] me013 | Yeah .
[27:59] fe041 | then there is this question of
[28:02] fe041 | do I use CrossPads ?
"[28:04] fe041 | So , I think that if"
[28:07] fe041 | we really seriously have me collect data
"[28:10] fe041 | and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it ,"
[28:20] fe041 | n
"[28:21] fe041 | I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do . But but having a small percentage of the data with it , I 'm not sure"
[28:27] fe041 | whether that 's useful or not . Maybe maybe it 's no big deal . Maybe we just do it and see what happens .
[28:35] me013 | information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff .
[28:38] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[28:39] me013 | So it 's sort of Landay supplying it so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do . So it it Right now he 's g operating from
[28:42] fe041 | Right .
[28:46] fe041 | Nothing .
"[28:51] me013 | You shou I mean , at least try it ."
[28:54] me013 | Yeah .
[28:56] fe041 | Right . OK .
"[28:56] me011 | And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away , so we could probably get more as well ."
"[28:57] fe016 | You know , what you can do with things ."
[29:01] fe016 | Yeah .
"[29:01] fe041 | That 's true . So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me ."
[29:02] fe016 | But not not to rely on them for basic modeling .
[29:16] me013 | Yeah .
[29:20] fe041 | Right .
[29:25] fe041 | Yeah .
[29:26] fe016 | I just wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those .
[29:28] me011 | Right . I ag I think I agree with that .
[29:29] fe041 | Right .
[29:29] fe016 | Yeah .
[29:30] fe041 | Right .
[29:31] fe041 | OK .
"[29:31] me011 | I think , though , the importance marking is a good idea , though ."
[29:35] me011 | That if if people have something
[29:36] fe016 | I 'd be sort of cool .
[29:40] me011 | Yeah .
[29:41] me011 | Do it on pilots or laptops or something .
"[29:50] fe041 | OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens ."
[29:50] me013 | OK .
"[29:56] fe041 | So , I I think that this is"
[29:59] fe041 | gonna be useful . So if we record data I will definitely ask for it .
"[30:03] fe041 | So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes ,"
"[30:11] me011 | Oh , OK . That 's fine ."
[30:11] fe041 | could could they send it to us ?
[30:13] me011 | Absolutely .
[30:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:13] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
[30:15] me011 | Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting .
[30:19] me011 | It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality . But
[30:22] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:22] me011 | I think it definitely
[30:25] me011 | if they exist .
[30:26] me011 | And then Jane 's idea of summarization afterward I think is not a bad one .
"[30:30] me011 | Um ,"
"[30:31] me011 | picking out basically to let you pick out keywords ,"
"[30:35] me011 | um , and , uh , construct queries ."
[30:40] me011 | People in the meeting .
"[30:43] me011 | You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go ,"
[30:43] fe008 | Uh - huh .
"[30:46] fe016 | Without hearing each other though , probably ."
[30:46] me011 | go around the table .
[30:48] me025 | Yeah .
[30:48] me013 | Yeah .
[30:48] me011 | Yeah .
[30:49] me022 | Or even just have one or two people stay behind .
[30:51] me011 | Yeah .
[30:51] me013 | Yeah .
[30:59] me011 | And see score them ?
[31:03] me011 | Oh .
[31:08] me011 | Hmm .
[31:10] me013 | Oh . Yeah .
[31:11] fe008 | That could be very interesting .
[31:12] me022 | Hmm .
[31:13] fe008 | Yeah .
[31:14] me013 | Ru -
"[31:15] me011 | I d yeah , I don't know how you would do it , though ."
[31:19] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:20] fe041 | I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door . So ,"
[31:28] me025 | Hmm .
[31:29] fe041 | you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this .
"[31:34] me011 | Maybe e Is email easier ? I mean , I when you first said"
"[31:37] me011 | do do it , um ,"
"[31:39] me011 | spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up and you have to hook them up to the recorder ."
[31:40] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:44] me011 | So , if they 're already here I think that 's good , but if they 're not already here for I 'd rather do email ."
[31:46] fe041 | Right .
[31:49] me011 | I 'm much faster typing than anything else .
[31:56] me011 | Yeah .
[31:58] me011 | I don't know .
[32:01] fe041 | at the end of the meeting is the best time . I just don't because
"[32:04] fe041 | they 're kind of a captive audience . Once they leave ,"
[32:06] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:07] fe041 | you know , forget it . But but i"
[32:12] me013 | Hmm .
"[32:18] me013 | Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing , that that y that you can't certainly can't require it or people aren't gonna want to do this . But but if there 's"
"[32:25] me013 | some cases where they will , then it would be helpful ."
[32:28] me022 | Hmm .
"[32:34] fe008 | uh , recognized by a particular individual ? If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be"
[32:41] me025 | Yeah .
"[32:41] fe008 | uh ,"
[32:41] fe008 | an ad addition to their database .
[32:42] me025 | It 's kind of nice . Yeah .
"[32:46] fe008 | Under the same acoustic circumstance , cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up ,"
[32:50] me025 | Right .
"[32:55] me022 | So I have a question about queries ,"
"[32:58] me022 | which is , um ,"
[32:59] me011 | Can we turn that light off ?
[33:03] me013 | The fl the fluorescent light is flickering . Yeah .
[33:03] me022 | I don't know .
[33:04] fe041 | Yeah .
"[33:05] fe016 | Oh , it is it is like OK ."
"[33:06] me011 | Very annoying . Oh , much better ."
[33:06] fe041 | Yeah .
[33:06] me022 | There you go . OK . Good .
[33:07] me013 | Yeah .
[33:16] me013 | OK .
"[33:16] me011 | I thought it was the projector for a moment . It was like , "" what 's going on ? """
"[33:16] me022 | So ,"
[33:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[33:19] me022 | the question I had about queries was , um , so what we 're planning to do is have people look at the summaries and then generate queries ?"
[33:26] me022 | Are are we gonna try and o
"[33:28] me022 | Yeah . Well , I mean ,"
"[33:30] me022 | so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ?"
[33:39] me013 | Mmm .
[33:45] me022 | n
[33:46] me013 | Yeah .
"[33:46] fe016 | Shouldn't Landay and his group be in charge of figuring out how to do this ? I mean , this is an issue"
[33:55] fe041 | Yeah ?
"[33:59] fe041 | Um , what 's our schedule ?"
"[34:04] fe041 | Let 's see ,"
[34:07] me013 | And you and I need to
[34:09] fe041 | Yeah . So so that was the prosody thing .
"[34:13] fe041 | Um , we need to finish the It 's already four - fifteen ."
"[34:13] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[34:16] me013 | Yeah .
"[34:17] fe041 | Uh , after . We need to finish this discussion , and you and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart ."
"[34:23] fe041 | So ,"
"[34:31] me013 | Um , I think we should"
"[34:35] me013 | be able to wind up in another half - hour or something , you think ?"
[34:37] me011 | At least . Yeah .
[34:38] me011 | m i Even if that much ? Less .
"[34:38] fe041 | Uh , less ."
[34:39] me013 | Less ?
"[34:43] fe041 | Action Yeah . So ,"
[34:45] fe041 | e e why don't you say five - thirty ?
[34:50] fe041 | Is that OK ? We 'll probably hit horrible traffic .
[34:57] fe041 | That 's not
[34:59] me013 | Yeah .
[35:04] me011 | who 's interested right now in doing anything . So he has very little manpower .
"[35:08] me011 | Um , there 's very little"
[35:10] me011 | allocated for him
"[35:11] me011 | and also he 's pretty focused on user interface . So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval , query generation , that sort of stuff ."
"[35:23] me013 | u I I actually think that that ,"
"[35:27] me013 | if we do have something like summaries ,"
"[35:29] me013 | then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more ,"
[35:38] me013 | give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .
"[35:42] me013 | I mean , ye Right ? If he doesn't know anything about the area ,"
[35:49] fe016 | But the people will just look at the summaries or the minutes and re and sort of back - generate the queries . That 's what I 'm worried about . So you might as well just give him the summaries .
[35:55] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:59] me022 | Well , I 'm not sure I 'm not sure that 's a solved problem ."
"[36:01] fe016 | Oh , OK . How to do this"
[36:03] me013 | Yeah .
[36:03] fe016 | from the summary .
[36:04] me022 | That was sort of what my question was aimed towards .
"[36:05] fe016 | So what you want to h to do is , people who were there ,"
[36:06] fe041 | Hmm .
"[36:08] fe016 | who later see , uh , minutes and s put in summary form , which is not gonna be at the same time as the meeting . There 's no way that can happen ."
[36:14] me011 | Right .
[36:14] me013 | Right .
[36:23] fe016 | But that 's done off they have to do that off - line .
[36:25] me011 | Yep . I agree .
[36:27] fe008 | I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question which would be
[36:27] fe016 | You -
"[36:31] fe008 | "" what was the most interesting"
"[36:33] fe008 | thing you got out of this meeting ? """
[36:40] fe008 | would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting
[36:43] me013 | I would think that would be the most likely thing .
[36:43] fe008 | fact .
[36:48] fe041 | But actually I would say that 's a better thing
[36:51] fe041 | to ask than have them summarize the meeting .
"[36:55] fe041 | You get two Yeah , that 's true ."
[36:56] me025 | Yeah .
"[37:00] me908 | Oh , you 're still here ."
[37:01] me013 | Yeah .
[37:01] me011 | We 're still here .
"[37:10] fe008 | Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack"
[37:14] fe008 | is something that I thought was interesting and that and that Dan worked on on that .
"[37:19] fe008 | you know . So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings but could be very informative ."
[37:22] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:30] fe041 | Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea ."
"[37:33] fe008 | I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either . You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment ."
[37:44] me011 | As many are willing to do it .
[37:50] fn043 | Yeah . That 's why I was wondering .
"[37:55] me011 | I mean , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries . But , uh ,"
"[37:58] me011 | people could , like , listen to them a little bit and generate some queries ."
[38:07] me025 | Yeah .
[38:11] me011 | Mmm .
[38:18] fe041 | for those pe people willing to stay .
[38:23] fe008 | some some of the little things that would be hidden .
[38:24] fe041 | And and that might be something people are willing to stay for .
[38:29] me011 | Or want to get up and leave .
"[38:29] fn043 | Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get"
"[38:32] fn043 | the effect that somebody says something and then you go around the room and they say "" yeah , me too , I agree . """
[38:37] me013 | Yeah .
[38:37] fe041 | That 's fine .
"[38:41] me011 | you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it ."
"[38:48] me011 | is to d generate queries in the future , so try to pick things that other people didn't say ."
"[38:54] me013 | It 's gonna take some thought . I mean ,"
"[38:57] me013 | The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially"
"[39:01] me013 | was , uh , that i"
"[39:04] me013 | basically the form that you 're doing something else later ,"
[39:07] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[39:08] me013 | and you want to pick up something
[39:10] me013 | from this meeting related to the something else .
[39:17] me025 | Mmm .
[39:17] fe041 | Right .
[39:17] me013 | rather than the And it might be something minor of minor importance to the meeting .
[39:21] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:21] me013 | Uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even ."
"[39:32] me013 | You weren't interested Say I I said "" well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue , I 'm more of an acoustics person "" ."
[39:36] me025 | Right .
"[39:37] me013 | But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm "" well what is what was that part that that that , uh , Mari was saying ? """
"[39:47] me013 | And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that"
[39:47] fe041 | Yeah .
[39:56] me013 | new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff .
"[40:02] me013 | So , I don't I don't know ."
"[40:02] fe041 | Well , I That 's hard to generate and and I think that 's half of what"
[40:03] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
[40:07] fe041 | i I would use it for . But I also a lot of times
[40:11] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:11] fe041 | um , make you know , think to myself "" this is interesting , I 've gotta come back"
"[40:16] fe041 | and follow up on it "" ."
[40:16] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[40:18] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:18] fe041 | So , things that I think are interesting ,"
"[40:22] fe041 | um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about ."
"[40:27] fe041 | And also , I like the idea of going around the room ,"
"[40:30] fe041 | because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it and then I 'd want to follow up on it ."
[40:36] me025 | Hmm .
"[40:40] me013 | I was concerned about ,"
"[40:42] me013 | uh , being interested in something later"
"[40:46] me013 | that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time , which for me is actually the dominant thing , because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if"
[40:57] me011 | But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you . By so by going around Yeah .
[41:05] me013 | Yeah .
[41:06] me011 | W we just need to start somewhere .
"[41:08] me022 | The question the question then is h h how much bias do we introduce by you know ,"
"[41:13] me022 | introduce by saying , you know , this was important now and , you know , maybe tha something else is important later ?"
[41:18] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[41:19] me022 | does the bias matter ? I I don't know .
[41:29] fe008 | And and those those can be two different things .
"[41:29] me022 | Uh , yeah , yeah ."
"[41:31] me022 | Sure , sure . But I I I guess that 's the question , really , is that I mean ,"
[41:31] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[41:34] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[41:36] me022 | does building queries based on what 's important now introduce an irreversible bias
[41:43] me022 | on being able to do what Morgan wants to do later ?
"[41:45] fe008 | OK , good ."
[41:46] fe008 | Yeah .
[41:47] me022 | Right .
"[41:51] me013 | the soonest we can do it ,"
[41:53] me013 | we need to get up some kind of system
[41:56] me013 | so that people who 've been involved in the meeting
"[41:59] me013 | can go back later ,"
"[42:01] me013 | even if it 's a poor system in some ways , and , uh and ask the questions that they actually want to know ."
"[42:07] me013 | If you know , if uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then"
[42:11] me013 | I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that . But obviously we have to
[42:19] me022 | Sure .
[42:19] fe041 | Right .
[42:19] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[42:20] me022 | I agree .
[42:20] fe041 | Right .
"[42:23] fe008 | I will say that that I I chose "" interesting "" because I think it includes also "" important """
"[42:27] fe008 | in some cases . But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information ."
"[42:32] me022 | I think "" important "" can often be uninteresting ."
[42:34] me025 | Mmm .
[42:35] fe041 | Mmm .
[42:43] fe041 | OK - OK .
[42:44] fe008 | Yeah .
[42:46] fe008 | Yeah .
"[42:53] fe041 | No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here ,"
"[42:56] fe041 | uh , and also moving on to action items and other things ,"
"[43:02] fe041 | let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important ,"
"[43:06] fe041 | um , that we at least decided on ."
"[43:11] fe041 | um , if Landay can get the , uh get them to to you guys ,"
"[43:16] fe041 | um , and see if they 're interesting . And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more ."
"[43:22] fe041 | Um ,"
[43:23] fe041 | getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway .
"[43:29] fe041 | Um ,"
[43:36] fe041 | a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .
"[43:42] fe041 | Uh , and then going around the room"
"[43:49] fe041 | qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned . So rather than say the most interesting thing ,"
"[43:56] fe041 | something interesting , and that way you 'll get more variety ."
[43:58] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[43:59] fe008 | That 's good . I like that . I like that .
"[43:59] me011 | I wouldn't even say that "" that they learned "" ."
[44:02] fe041 | OK .
[44:02] me025 | Yeah .
[44:13] fe041 | And then the last thing c
[44:16] fe041 | would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards
[44:20] fe041 | and give an oral summary .
[44:24] fe041 | OK ? Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ?
"[44:27] fe041 | That well , that we want to do ?"
[44:29] fe008 | And one and one qualification on on the oral summaries . They 'd be s they 'd be separate . They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries .
[44:33] fe041 | OK .
"[44:44] me011 | Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me ."
[44:46] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[44:46] fe008 | Mm - hmm . OK .
"[44:51] me025 | And that if if that ever should happen , then we should try and write them down ."
[44:55] me013 | Right .
"[44:55] me011 | Give them a reward , a dollar a query ?"
[44:56] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
[44:58] me013 | Yeah .
[45:05] me011 | Yeah .
[45:13] me011 | Yeah .
[45:13] fe041 | Right . OK . So . Yeah .
[45:13] me025 | Yeah .
"[45:14] fe016 | I think I just wanted to say one thing about queries . I mean ,"
"[45:19] fe016 | the level of the query could be , you know , very low - level or very high - level . And"
"[45:25] fe016 | it gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go up , right ?"
"[45:33] fe016 | you know , if this is something that requires a a one - word answer or it 's one place in the recording versus was there general agreement"
[45:40] me025 | Hmm .
"[45:41] fe016 | on this issue of all the people who ha You know , you can gen you can ask queries that are meaningful for people . In fact , they 're very meaningful cuz they 're very high - level ."
[45:45] me011 | Yep .
[45:52] me011 | Absolutely . So I think we 're gonna have to start
[45:52] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:58] me013 | I I 'm not so sure I agree with that . Because uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is . If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish ,"
[46:00] me011 | Really ?
"[46:05] me011 | Oh , that 's true ."
"[46:05] me013 | we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data . And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great , that 's , you know , research project for year four or something . You know ?"
[46:08] me025 | Yeah . Yeah .
[46:09] fe041 | Right .
"[46:12] me025 | Research , yeah ."
[46:12] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[46:14] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:15] me011 | Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz , but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings ."
"[46:22] me013 | Um ,"
"[46:24] me011 | So . Oh , yeah . I I understand ."
"[46:30] me025 | Get people to ask questions that they def the machine definitely can't answer at the moment , but Yeah ."
[46:33] me011 | Yep .
"[46:34] me013 | Yeah . w Just "" what would you like to know ? """
"[46:34] me011 | But that neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is ."
[46:43] fe041 | OK .
[46:44] fe008 | which could be obtained from the text from the transcript .
[46:47] me011 | Right . Since we have the transcript .
[46:48] fe008 | Yeah .
[46:54] me011 | Dates maybe . I don't know . That 's something I always forget .
"[46:56] fe008 | Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified , but text - oriented ."
"[47:05] fe016 | I mean , in gen that 's all I remember from most meetings ."
"[47:06] fe008 | I think you 'd remember that , yeah ."
"[47:08] fe016 | So , in general , I mean , that could be something you could say , right ? I 'm supposed to do this ."
"[47:17] fe008 | you know , "" other than your action item "" , you know , whatever . But but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query . So ."
"[47:22] fe016 | I mean , that 's realistically what people might well be remembering . So ."
[47:27] me013 | Hmm .
"[47:29] fe041 | Well , we 're piloting . We 'll just do it and see what happens ."
[47:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[47:32] fe008 | Yeah .
[47:32] me013 | Yeah .
[47:33] me013 | I usually don't remember my action items .
[47:40] me013 | Yeah .
[47:42] me011 | Sure . Can you hand me my note pad ?
"[47:43] fe041 | Um ,"
[47:50] me025 | Yeah . Then we 'll know .
"[47:51] me013 | We we had I mean ,"
"[47:52] me013 | somewhere up there we had milestones , but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , uh , from the description things ?"
"[47:57] fe041 | Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them ."
[48:03] me013 | OK .
[48:09] fe041 | OK .
"[48:10] fe041 | What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject ,"
"[48:16] fe041 | um ,"
[48:19] fe008 | Good .
[48:19] me011 | Yep .
"[48:24] fe041 | for their for web pages , to c and I 'll put together an overall cover ."
[48:29] fe041 | And you 're s
[48:30] fe041 | Hmm ?
[48:34] me025 | that 's p
[48:35] me011 | Right .
[48:35] me025 | PDA - free . Yeah .
"[48:38] fe041 | Um ,"
[48:42] me011 | Mailing lists .
"[48:46] me013 | Three of them . Well I mean ,"
"[48:48] fe041 | Uh , I think w Yeah ."
"[48:50] me013 | uh ,"
"[48:58] fe041 | um , about getting the data . Who should I email ?"
"[49:08] fe041 | How about if I just c Uh , Right now all I want I personally only want text data ."
[49:15] fe041 | But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey . But I think all he would want is the digits .
"[49:24] fe041 | Um , but I 'll just speak for myself . I 'm interested in getting the language model data ."
"[49:28] fe041 | Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions ."
[49:30] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[49:31] fe008 | OK . So y
[49:31] fe041 | So then just email you ?
"[49:32] fe008 | Sure , sure , sure ."
[49:33] fe041 | OK .
"[49:34] fe008 | You could email to both of us , uh , just I mean , if you wanted to . I mean , I don't think"
[49:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[49:38] fe041 | OK .
[49:38] me013 | i
[49:40] fe041 | And your email is ?
[49:40] me013 | i
[49:42] fe008 | Edwards at
[49:45] fe008 | ICSI .
[49:45] fe041 | OK .
"[49:46] me011 | Dot Berkeley dot EDU , of course ."
"[49:46] me013 | In in our phone call , uh , before , we we , uh It turns out the way we 're gonna send the data is by , uh , CD - ROMs."
"[49:56] me013 | and then what they 're gonna do is take the CD - ROM and transfer it to analog tape and give it to a transcription service , uh , that will Yeah ."
"[50:02] me011 | Oh , is this IBM ?"
"[50:07] me011 | Uh , so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ?"
[50:11] fe008 | Yeah . They they don't have a way .
[50:12] me011 | I thought so .
[50:13] fe008 | But they have a verification .
[50:15] me011 | Mix ?
"[50:15] me013 | probably about like you did , and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well ."
"[50:21] me013 | they 'll , uh they run their aligner on it and it kicks out things that don't work well , which you know , the overlaps will certainly"
[50:36] me013 | Yeah .
[50:39] me013 | Yeah .
[50:40] me013 | Good idea .
[50:41] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:42] fe016 | I mean , they 're not gonna easily be able to do that , probably ."
[50:46] me011 | So .
[50:47] me022 | But w
[50:47] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:48] me022 | It 's not Right . It doesn't it isn't difficult for us to do , so we might as well just do it ."
[50:48] me011 | Yep . Absolutely .
[50:49] fe016 | I
"[50:51] me011 | Absolutely . So , sure ."
"[50:57] fe041 | OK . Related to to the conversation with Picheny , I need to email him ,"
"[51:03] fe041 | uh , my shipping address and you need to email them something which you already did ."
[51:16] fe008 | and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions which you got a copy of today .
[51:27] fe008 | Good .
"[51:30] fe008 | Oh , excellent . Good ."
[51:37] fe008 | I C - I CC ' ed Morgan . I should have sent I should have CC ' ed you as well .
[51:40] me011 | Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information .
[51:47] fe041 | OK .
"[51:49] me011 | Well , or d or not even higher level , different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff . We 're gonna"
[51:55] me011 | have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that .
"[51:57] me013 | Yeah , we w"
[52:00] me013 | Right .
[52:03] me011 | But that 's not That 's display . That 's different than format .
"[52:03] fe041 | Oh , OK ."
[52:12] fe008 | Yeah .
"[52:14] fe008 | OK , excellent ."
"[52:15] me013 | OK . So , what n"
"[52:17] fe008 | Well , it c"
[52:19] me025 | Right .
"[52:22] fn043 | No , I think that 's fine ."
[52:23] me013 | So a key thing will be that you we tell you
[52:24] fe008 | Great .
[52:29] me025 | Yeah .
"[52:35] fe041 | Oh , yeah ."
[52:36] me013 | we 're gonna call up your Communicator thing and and we 're gonna be
"[52:44] fn043 | Now , something that I mentioned earlier to Mari and Liz is that it 's probably important to get as many non - technical and non - speech people as possible"
[52:52] fn043 | in order to get some realistic users . So if you could ask other people to call
"[53:00] fn043 | Cuz we don't want people who already know how to deal with dialogue systems , who know that"
"[53:07] fe041 | Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you ,"
[53:11] me013 | Yeah .
"[53:12] fe041 | um , which is"
"[53:13] me013 | Yeah , we can do that ."
[53:13] fe041 | the n
[53:13] me011 | Get my parents to do it .
"[53:15] fn043 | Yeah , for instance ."
[53:15] fe041 | Yeah . Yeah . Seriously .
[53:16] me013 | Yeah .
[53:19] me013 | Hmm .
[53:20] fe041 | Yeah .
"[53:21] fe041 | e You know , it could result in some good bloopers , which is always good for presentations ."
[53:28] me013 | Yeah . @ @
[53:29] me011 | I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up .
[53:35] fe041 | Mmm .
[53:40] me013 | OK .
"[53:46] me013 | We talked about that we 're getting the recording equipment running at UW . And so it depends ,"
[53:51] me013 | w e e e
"[53:52] me013 | they 're you know , they 're p m"
"[53:54] me013 | If that comes together within the next month , there at least will be , uh , uh ,"
"[54:05] fe041 | get it put together by the beginning of August . So , um ,"
"[54:10] me013 | But we have it it 's it 's pretty We don't know . I mean , he he s uh , he said that it was sitting in some room collecting dust and and so we don't know ,"
"[54:11] fe041 | you know , if"
[54:18] me013 | i e
"[54:18] fe041 | i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off , but a at least it 's worth trying ."
[54:22] me011 | Mm - hmm . What is it ?
[54:24] me013 | We don't know .
"[54:24] me011 | Oh , OK ."
[54:27] me025 | Yeah .
"[54:29] me013 | W We know it 's eight channels . Uh , we know it 's digital ."
[54:31] me011 | It 's eight tape recorders .
"[54:32] me013 | We don't even know if there 're microphones . So ,"
[54:37] me013 | we 'll find out .
"[54:38] fe041 | OK . Um , and I will email"
"[54:44] fe041 | Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff ,"
"[54:48] fe041 | although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads ."
"[54:53] me013 | Yeah , OK . I 'll do that ."
[54:55] fe041 | OK .
"[54:57] me013 | Um , and he also said something about outside there that came up about the outside text sources , that he he may have"
[55:04] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[55:05] fe041 | Oh !
[55:05] me013 | some text sources that are close enough to the sort of thing that we can
[55:06] fn043 | Hmm .
[55:10] me013 | play with them for a language model .
"[55:16] me025 | finds web pages that are thematically related to what you 're talking about . Well , that 's the idea ."
[55:23] me025 | supposedly got the right vocabulary .
[55:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[55:26] fe041 | Right .
"[55:31] fe041 | But but that 's actually what I wanna do . That 's that 's what I wanna work with , is is"
[55:33] me025 | OK .
[55:36] me025 | Yeah .
[55:36] fe041 | things that s the wrong material but the right
[55:40] fe041 | da the right source .
[55:40] me025 | Yeah .
[55:40] me011 | Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is
[55:41] fe041 | Yeah .
[55:43] me011 | not gonna be working on that anymore . He 's switching to
"[55:45] fe041 | Yeah . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant ."
[55:46] me011 | other stuff again .
[55:56] me011 | Who ? Landay or Jason ?
[55:58] fe041 | Landay .
[55:58] me011 | OK .
[55:58] me013 | OK .
"[55:59] fe041 | And , uh , um ,"
"[56:02] fe041 | you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers"
"[56:06] fe041 | I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages . That 's what we could do ."
[56:09] fe041 | You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor -
[56:11] me011 | True .
[56:12] fe041 | Yeah !
[56:12] me011 | Absolutely .
[56:13] me025 | Sure .
"[56:14] fe041 | Oh , forget this !"
"[56:15] me011 | Well , but that 's not very much ."
[56:19] fe041 | I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders .
[56:22] me011 | Yep .
[56:23] me025 | Right .
[56:25] fe041 | Yeah .
[56:27] me025 | Yeah .
[56:29] me025 | Yeah .
[56:30] me013 | Yeah . So we can we can we can do better than that . Yeah .
[56:30] me025 | We can do that .
[56:32] me011 | Yeah .
[56:33] fn043 | Mm - hmm .
[56:36] fe016 | And Xerox .
"[56:37] fe041 | So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox ,"
[56:38] me013 | And Xerox . Yeah .
"[56:38] fe016 | And there 's You should l look under , like , intelligent environments , smart rooms ,"
"[56:43] me011 | Um , the "" Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand "" is a good one ."
[56:47] fe016 | th
[56:52] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[56:56] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[57:00] fe041 | OK .
[57:01] fe041 | Great . That solves that problem . One less action item .
[57:09] fe041 | OK . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of .
"[57:19] fe008 | um , so ,"
"[57:20] fe008 | um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech ,"
"[57:27] fe008 | uh , are lessened ."
"[57:30] fe008 | Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider"
"[57:33] fe008 | maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um ,"
"[57:37] fe008 | u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever ."
"[57:46] fe008 | Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , I mean , we were discussing this earlier , that"
"[57:49] fe008 | depending on the task so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap . But , um ,"
"[57:55] fe008 | i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway ."
"[57:59] fe008 | But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field"
[58:04] fe008 | mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?
[58:06] me013 | Hmm .
"[58:10] fe041 | I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try"
"[58:14] fe041 | to get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW ,"
[58:18] fe008 | OK .
"[58:21] fe041 | that I probably can do more than you guys , cuz you guys"
[58:25] fe041 | are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here .
[58:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[58:28] fe041 | But we can get anybody in EE ,"
"[58:32] fe041 | uh , over and and possibly also some CS people ,"
[58:38] fe008 | OK .
[58:40] fe041 | that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .
"[58:41] fe008 | Just want to be sure there 's enough data to OK , good ."
"[58:43] fe041 | Um ,"
"[58:54] fe016 | Y you know , anything that was televised for a third party"
[58:54] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[58:57] fe016 | has the characteristic of not very much overlap .
[59:01] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[59:01] fe016 | So .
[59:06] fe041 | Right .
"[59:06] fe008 | Mm - hmm . On the task , and the task ."
"[59:09] fe008 | I just wanted to uh , because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to ."
[59:10] me013 | Yeah .
[59:15] me013 | Yeah .
"[59:16] fe008 | Not not entirely modify it , but lessen it if if it 's desired ."
[59:21] fe008 | But if if that 's sufficient data I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .
"[59:33] fe041 | OK . So I 'm just writing here ,"
[59:35] fe041 | we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction but we 're gonna try to get more variety by
[59:41] fe041 | i using different groups of people
"[59:49] fe008 | Fine . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree . I just wanted to be sure ."
[59:51] fe041 | e e
"[59:55] fe041 | And then the other thing might be , um ,"
"[59:59] fe041 | uh , technical"
[00:02] fe041 | versus administrative .
[00:06] fe041 | Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings
"[00:09] fe041 | then that may have less overlap , because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever ."
[00:14] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:19] fe008 | eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are"
"[00:23] fe008 | prevented from overlapping . They 'll just say , you know you know , "" wait till each person is finished before you say something "" ."
[00:28] fe008 | So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to . But but these other factors are fine . I just wanted to raise the issue .
"[00:40] fe041 | uh ,"
[00:43] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:46] fe008 | Yeah , I think that 's always desired . I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process ,"
[00:49] fe008 | i u
"[00:49] fe008 | uh , you know , as much data as we can ."
[00:56] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:57] fe016 | And there was a big division , so"
[00:59] me013 | Yeah .
[01:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[01:07] fe016 | And and there 's lots of television , you know , stuff on , um ,"
"[01:11] fe016 | political debates and things like that , congre congressional hearings ."
[01:16] fe016 | Boring stuff like that .
"[01:18] fe016 | Um ,"
[01:19] fe016 | and then the CMU folks and I were sort of on the other side in cuz they had collected a lot of
[01:23] fe016 | meetings that were sort of like this and said that those are nothing like these meetings .
"[01:33] fe016 | that if there 's found data that can be transformed for use in speech recognition easily , then of course we would do it ,"
[01:40] fe016 | but newly collected data would would be natural meetings .
[01:45] fe016 | So .
"[01:49] fe016 | As far as I know , they h have not . Um , but e"
[01:51] me013 | OK .
"[01:53] me011 | it 's not near - far , right ?"
"[01:56] fe016 | I 'm not sure . Um ,"
"[01:59] fe016 | if people were interested they could talk to them , but I I got the feeling there was some politics involved ."
[02:04] fe016 | No .
[02:06] me013 | Just to check . Yeah . W we should know what 's out there certainly . Yeah .
[02:06] fe016 | I I don't know .
[02:07] me011 | Yeah .
"[02:08] me011 | Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field ,"
[02:11] me011 | intelligent - room sorts of things . I hadn't known that then they 'd done any more than that .
"[02:11] me025 | Oh , really ? It 's those guys ."
[02:15] me011 | Yeah .
"[02:17] fe016 | But they had multiple mikes and they did do recognition , and they did do real conversations ."
[02:22] fe016 | But as far as I know they didn't offer that data to the community at this meeting .
[02:25] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:29] fe016 | you know , Mark 's really into this . We should keep in touch with him ."
[02:32] me013 | Yeah .
[02:38] fe041 | Is that an action item ?
"[02:45] me013 | uh ,"
[02:51] me011 | I think everyone here is on the list .
[02:53] me013 | Yeah .
[02:54] fe008 | u e e
[02:56] me011 | I think you are .
[02:59] me022 | Oh ! OK .
[02:59] fe008 | Yeah .
[03:00] me013 | We 're just compiling the list .
[03:02] me022 | I see .
[03:07] me025 | Who specifically ask not to be .
"[03:07] me011 | Like Jane , for example ."
[03:10] me013 | Yeah .
[03:12] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:29] fe016 | You know , the pe these people weren't wearing close - talking mikes ,"
"[03:32] fe016 | but they were recorded anyway , like the congressional hearings and , you know , for legal purposes or whatever ."
[03:35] fe008 | OK .
[03:36] fe008 | But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields .
"[03:40] fe016 | Mark 's aware of those , too . That would be found data because they found it and it exists . They didn't have to collect it ."
[03:41] fe008 | OK . Exactly .
[03:43] me011 | Hmm .
"[03:50] fe008 | Yeah . OK , OK . That 's interesting ."
"[03:52] fe016 | You know , Mark was really a fan"
"[03:54] fe016 | of getting as much data as possible from you know , reams and reams of stuff , of broadcast stuff , web stuff , TV stuff , radio stuff ."
[04:00] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:03] fe016 | But he well understands that that 's very different than these this type of meeting . But ,"
[04:03] me011 | It 's not the same .
[04:08] fe016 | so what ? It 's still it 's interesting for other reasons .
[04:10] fe008 | OK .
[04:11] fe008 | Yeah . Just wanted to know .
"[04:13] me013 | So , seems like we 're winding down . Right ?"
[04:17] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[04:19] me025 | So we should go go around and s
[04:23] me025 | We should go around and say something interesting that happened at the meeting ?
"[04:26] fe041 | Oh . Yes , we should do that ."
[04:31] me013 | Oh ! Good man .
[04:32] fn043 | Hmm .
"[04:33] me011 | So , um ,"
"[04:34] me011 | I really liked the idea of what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech . Especially ,"
"[04:40] me011 | um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking ."
"[04:43] me011 | So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ?"
"[04:47] me011 | Can you do special gestures and so on that that have ,"
"[04:50] me011 | uh , special meaning to the corpora ? I really liked that ."
"[05:07] fe008 | and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of ,"
"[05:10] fe008 | uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be because it depends on what your purpose is . So I actually"
[05:19] fe008 | of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting . But
"[05:22] fe008 | that 's not really a specific fact . I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there , which I thought"
[05:29] fe008 | was worthwhile .
[05:30] me025 | I had a real revelation about taking pictures . I don't know why I didn't do this before and I regret it . So that was very interesting for me .
[05:36] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[05:36] me011 | Did you take pictures of the boards ?
[05:37] fe008 | Yeah .
[05:42] fe008 | That 's a good point . Yeah .
[05:42] fe041 | They 're related to this morning 's meeting .
[05:44] me011 | To the pre previous meeting . That 's right .
"[05:46] me025 | OK . Well , that 's why I 'll take pictures of them , then ."
"[05:55] me022 | So . Um ,"
[05:57] me022 | so I 'm gonna pass for the moment but y come come back to me .
"[06:09] fe041 | uh , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said , this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take"
"[06:15] fe041 | minutes , and that actually may be a goal . So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data ,"
"[06:23] fe041 | uh , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data ."
"[06:39] fn043 | it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it ,"
"[06:46] fn043 | uh , in this project . But , um ,"
[06:52] me011 | I wonder if work 's already been done on it .
[06:58] me013 | Hmm .
"[07:15] me013 | and not any of the facts . That is , I I really enjoyed"
[07:18] me013 | hanging out with this group of people today . So that 's what really impressed me .
"[07:29] me025 | Oh , yeah ."
"[07:31] me022 | Well , I mean , one thing you could search for is were people laughing a lot . Right ? So ."
[07:35] me025 | Right .
[07:36] me025 | How happy were they ?
[07:45] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[07:47] me025 | That 's great .
[07:49] me011 | So we need a laugh detector .
[07:50] me025 | Yeah .
[07:51] fe041 | Mm - hmm .
[07:51] me025 | Perfect .
[07:52] me011 | Cuz that seems to be pretty common .
[07:57] me011 | Not in the congressional hearings .
[08:02] me013 | So I think we 're done .
[08:03] me025 | OK . Great .
[08:03] fe041 | OK .
[08:03] me011 | I think we 're done .
[08:03] me022 | OK .
[08:04] fe008 | @ @
[08:04] fe041 | Great .
[08:04] me013 | Great .
[08:09] me025 | No . Just just leave it .
[08:11] me013 | Now these we turn off .
[08:13] me013 | Right ?
[08:17] me011 | Now they even have working L E Ds .
"[08:19] fe008 | Oh ! Hey , that 's cool ."
[08:20] me013 | Do they ?
[08:21] me011 | Yeah . Absolutely .
[08:23] fe016 | Huh .
[08:23] fe008 | That 'd be nice . OK .
[08:24] me025 | @ @ knows .
"[08:24] me011 | You don't think John uh , Jim would make"
[08:26] me011 | a box that didn't have a
"[08:27] me011 | flashing light on it , do you ?"

[00:05] me018 | OK .
[00:15] me013 | Uh .
[00:28] me013 | You wanna ?
[00:28] me018 | Should we take turns ? You want me to run it today ?
[00:31] me018 | OK . Um .
[00:36] me018 | things that we should talk about .
"[00:38] me018 | Um ,"
"[00:40] me018 | I guess there 's the usual updates , everybody going around and saying ,"
"[00:44] me018 | uh , you know , what they 're working on , the things that happened the last week ."
[00:48] me018 | But aside from that is there anything in particular that anybody wants to bring up
[00:52] mn052 | Mmm .
[00:53] me018 | for today ?
"[00:56] me018 | No ? OK . So why don't we just around and people can give updates . Uh , do you want to start , Stephane ?"
[00:57] fn002 | Oh .
[01:10] mn007 | Um . Yeah .
"[01:12] me018 | This is what what do you , uh what 's in the paper there ?"
"[01:14] mn007 | So it 's the paper that describe basically the , um ,"
[01:17] mn007 | system that were proposed for the Aurora .
[01:20] me018 | The one that we s we submitted the last round ?
"[01:22] mn007 | Right , yeah ."
[01:23] me018 | Uh - huh .
[01:32] me018 | Hmm .
[01:35] mn007 | Yeah .
[01:35] me018 | Where where 's it gonna be this year ?
"[01:37] mn007 | It 's , uh , Aalborg in Denmark . And it 's , yeah ,"
"[01:39] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[01:42] me018 | Mmm .
"[01:47] mn007 | Yeah . Then , uh , whhh well , I 've been working on on t mainly on on - line normalization this week ."
"[01:56] mn007 | Uh , I 've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches ."
"[02:12] mn007 | Uh , second thing is , uh , the training of , uh , on - line normalization with two different means ,"
[02:18] mn007 | one mean for the silence and one for the speech .
[02:36] mn007 | although it doesn't hurt . So .
"[02:38] mn007 | But well , both on - line normalization approach seems equivalent ."
[02:44] me018 | Are the means pretty different for the two ?
[02:48] mn007 | Yeah . They can be very different . Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[02:50] me018 | Hmm .
[03:04] mn007 | Um .
[03:11] mn007 | for C - zero and C - one than for the other coefficients .
[03:18] mn007 | Yeah .
"[03:23] mn007 | There are strange strange thing happening with C - one , is that"
"[03:27] mn007 | when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be"
[03:34] mn007 | different .
[03:35] me018 | Hmm .
"[03:42] mn007 | I was expecting th the s that these two mean helps , especially because of the the strange"
"[03:48] mn007 | C - ze C - one shape ,"
"[03:50] mn007 | uh , which can like , yo you can have ,"
"[03:54] mn007 | um ,"
"[03:56] mn007 | a trajectory for the speech and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere , but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else ."
[04:04] me018 | Oh .
"[04:04] mn007 | So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have"
"[04:18] mn007 | Mmm . But I still have to investigate further , I think ."
"[04:21] mn007 | Um , a third thing is , um ,"
"[04:27] mn007 | t having a fixed time constant ,"
[04:30] mn007 | I try to have a time constant that 's smaller at the beginning of the utterances
[04:36] mn007 | to adapt more quickly to the r something that 's closer to the right mean .
"[04:49] mn007 | well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still ,"
[04:58] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[05:08] mn007 | Mmm .
"[05:09] mn007 | Uh , well , this doesn't help neither , but this doesn't hurt . So , well ."
"[05:16] me018 | Wasn't there some experiment you were gonna try where you did something differently for each ,"
"[05:21] me018 | um , uh I don't know whether it was each"
[05:31] me018 | some parameter you were gonna vary depending on the frequency .
"[05:39] mn007 | I don't know . No . u Maybe it 's this this idea of having different on - line normalization ,"
"[05:46] mn007 | um , tunings for the different MFCC 's ."
[05:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:55] me018 | Yeah . I I thought , Morgan , you brought it up a couple meetings ago . And then it was something about ,"
"[05:59] me018 | uh , some and then somebody said "" yeah , it does seem like , you know , C - zero is"
"[06:03] me018 | the one that 's , you know , the major one "" or , uh , s I can't remember exactly what it was now ."
"[06:10] mn007 | Yeah . There uh , actually , yeah ."
"[06:12] mn007 | S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero and much less to normalize the other coefficients . And , um ,"
"[06:22] mn007 | actu uh , well , at least with the current on - line normalization scheme . And"
"[06:27] mn007 | we I think , we"
[06:36] mn007 | and Yeah .
[06:39] mn007 | I was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means .
[06:47] mn007 | Um Yeah .
"[06:55] me013 | I I really would like to suggest looking , um ,"
[07:03] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:05] me013 | sometimes , but but , um ,"
[07:07] me013 | just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not
[07:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[07:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:18] me013 | or , um ,"
[07:31] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[07:35] mn007 | Mmm .
"[07:42] mn007 | So that 's it , I think , for the on - line normalization ."
[07:50] mn007 | Yeah . I 've been playing a little bit with
"[07:53] mn007 | some kind of thresholding , and ,"
"[08:00] mn007 | as a first experiment , I think I"
"[08:02] mn007 | Yeah . Well , what I did is t is to take ,"
"[08:17] mn007 | Well , this for each mel band ."
[08:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:26] me013 | Mmm .
"[08:29] mn007 | Actually it was not a threshold , it was just adding noise ."
[08:31] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:32] mn007 | So I was adding a white noise energy ,"
"[08:42] mn007 | Yeah . When we look at at the , um , MFCC that result from this , they are a lot more smoother ."
"[08:49] mn007 | Um ,"
"[09:01] mn007 | well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two ."
[09:05] me018 | Hmm .
"[09:08] mn007 | And Yeah . And the result that we have in term of speech recognition , actually it 's not it 's not worse ,"
"[09:16] mn007 | but it 's , um , kind of surprising that it 's not worse because"
[09:20] mn007 | basically you add noise that 's fifteen DB just fifteen DB below the maximum energy . And
[09:26] me018 | So why does that m smooth things out ? I don't I don't understand that .
"[09:38] me018 | Huh . Oh , OK ."
[09:42] mn007 | and the high - energy portion of the speech
"[09:46] mn007 | don't get much affected anyway by the other noise . And as the noise you add is the same is the shape , it 's also the same ."
[09:53] me018 | Hmm .
[09:54] me013 | Yeah .
[10:05] me013 | The reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because it 's different in training and test . Even if
[10:15] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:20] me013 | to to first order , the only th noise that you have is white noise and you 've added the same thing to training and test . So it 's ,"
[10:23] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[10:25] me018 | Hmm .
"[10:27] me018 | So would that be similar to , like , doing the smoothing , then , over time or ?"
[10:43] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:45] mn007 | Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch"
[10:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[10:50] mn007 | a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database . If if you compare
"[10:56] mn007 | th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n"
[11:01] mn007 | n n
[11:01] mn007 | the MFCC are not very different .
"[11:04] mn007 | They are very different when energy 's lower , like during fricatives or during speech pauses ."
"[11:11] mn007 | And ,"
"[11:14] me013 | Yeah , but you 're still getting more recognition errors , which means that the differences , even though they look like they 're not so big ,"
[11:21] me013 | are are hurting your recognition . Right ?
[11:21] mn007 | Ye -
[11:23] mn007 | Yeah . So it distort the speech . Right . Um .
[11:26] me013 | Yeah .
[11:27] me018 | So performance went down ?
[11:29] me018 | Oh .
"[11:31] mn007 | Yeah . So , but in this case I I really expect that maybe"
"[11:36] mn007 | the the two these two stream of features , they are very different . I mean , and"
"[11:53] me013 | maybe you 'd want to have something that was a little more adaptive . Secondly , you happened to pick fifteen DB and"
[11:57] mn007 | Mmm .
[11:59] mn007 | Yeah .
"[11:59] me013 | maybe twenty 'd be better , or or twelve ."
[12:01] mn007 | Yeah . Right .
"[12:02] me018 | So what was the what was the threshold part of it ? Was the threshold , uh , how far down ?"
"[12:06] me013 | Yeah . Well , he yeah , he had to figure out how much to add ."
[12:08] me013 | So he was looking he was looking at the peak value .
[12:11] me018 | Uh - huh .
[12:12] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[12:14] me018 | And and so what 's ho I don't understand . How does it go ? If it if if the peak value 's above some threshold , then you add the noise ? Or if it 's below s"
"[12:22] mn007 | I systematically add the noise , but"
"[12:26] mn007 | the , um , noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak ."
[12:32] mn007 | Mmm .
[12:34] mn007 | Um .
[12:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:36] mn007 | Yeah . Which is not really noise , actually . It 's just adding a constant to each of the mel , uh , energy ."
[12:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:46] mn007 | To each of the mel filter bank . Yeah .
[12:48] me018 | I see .
"[12:49] mn007 | So , yeah , it 's really , uh , white noise . I th"
[12:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:54] me013 | So then afterwards a log is taken , and that 's"
[12:58] me013 | so
[13:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[13:01] me013 | the little variation tends to go away .
[13:04] mn007 | Um .
[13:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[13:25] me013 | is another way to go .
[13:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[13:27] me013 | Um .
[13:28] mn007 | Yeah .
[13:40] me013 | system ?
"[13:43] mn007 | Yeah . It was it was , uh , the same system ."
[13:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[13:50] me013 | OK .
[13:50] mn007 | It was the same system .
"[14:06] mn007 | I play a little bit with the , um finding what was different between ,"
"[14:23] mn007 | And there were a couple of differences , like the LDA filters were not the same ."
"[14:29] mn007 | Um ,"
"[14:36] mn007 | Um ,"
[14:38] mn007 | the number o of MFCC that was were used was different . You used thirteen and we used fifteen .
"[14:45] mn007 | Well , a bunch of differences . And , um , actually"
[14:52] mn007 | the result that he he got were much better on TI - digits especially .
[14:56] mn007 | So I 'm kind of investigated to see what
[15:00] mn007 | was the main factor for this difference . And it seems that
[15:03] mn007 | the LDA filter is is was hurting .
"[15:08] mn007 | Um , so when we put s some noise compensation"
"[15:13] mn007 | the , um , LDA filter that that 's derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal ."
"[15:20] mn007 | And it makes a big difference , um , on TI - digits"
"[15:28] mn007 | Uh , if we use the the old LDA filter , I mean the LDA filter that was in the proposal , we have , like , eighty - two point seven percent recognition rate ,"
[15:39] mn007 | on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech .
"[15:46] mn007 | so from eighty - two point seven to eighty - five point one ,"
[15:50] mn007 | which is
[15:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[15:51] mn007 | a huge leap .
[15:54] mn007 | Um .
"[15:57] mn007 | Yeah . So now the results are more similar , and"
"[16:01] mn007 | I don't I will not , I think , investigate on the other differences ,"
[16:05] mn007 | which is like the number of MFCC that we keep and other small things
[16:09] mn007 | that we can I think optimize later on anyway .
"[16:12] me013 | Sure . But on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth , it might be good to standardize on the piece"
[16:19] me013 | that we 're not changing . Right ? So if there 's
"[16:46] mn052 | The whatever you , uh , tested with recently . Right ?"
[16:47] mn007 | Mmm ?
[16:49] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:49] mn052 | Yeah ?
"[16:52] me013 | Yeah , you 're trying to add in France Telecom . Tell them about the rest of it . Like you said the number of filters might be"
[16:58] mn052 | The number of cepstral coefficients is what ?
[16:59] me013 | Cep -
[16:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:01] me013 | Yeah . So , I mean , I think we 'd wanna standardize there , wouldn't we ?"
"[17:03] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
[17:05] mn052 | Yeah .
[17:07] mn052 | Yeah .
"[17:08] me013 | Well , all th all three of you ."
"[17:16] mn052 | what we have in the repositories , with uses fifteen ."
[17:20] mn007 | Right . Yeah .
"[17:20] mn052 | Yeah , so Yeah , so Yep ."
[17:22] mn007 | But we will use the the LDA filters f derived from clean speech .
"[17:26] mn007 | Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter . It 's"
[17:30] mn007 | something that 's also short enough in in latency . So .
[17:32] mn052 | Yeah . Well . Yeah .
"[17:34] mn052 | So , we haven't w we have been always using , uh , fifteen coefficients , not thirteen ? Yeah ."
[17:39] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[17:46] mn052 | Um . Yeah .
[17:50] mn052 | mmm @ @
"[17:50] me013 | I think as long as you guys agree on it , it doesn't matter . I think we have a maximum of sixty ,"
"[18:01] mn052 | Yeah . Ma - maybe we can I mean , at least ,"
"[18:05] mn052 | um , I 'll t s run some experiments to see whether once I have this"
[18:12] mn007 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[18:18] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:21] mn007 | Yeah . And there is there is also this log energy versus C - zero .
"[18:22] mn052 | Sorry , fifteen ."
"[18:24] mn052 | Yeah , the log energy versus C - zero ."
[18:26] mn007 | Well .
"[18:27] mn052 | Uh , that 's that 's the other thing . I mean , without noise compensation certainly C - zero is better than log energy ."
"[18:33] mn052 | Be - I mean , because the there are more , uh , mismatched conditions than the matching conditions for testing ."
[18:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:40] mn052 | You know , always for the matched condition , you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than C - zero ."
[18:46] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:46] mn052 | But not for I mean ,"
[18:53] mn052 | I mean you get a better performance with log energy .
[18:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:56] mn052 | Well , um , maybe once we have this noise compensation , I don't know , we have to try that also , whether we want to go for C - zero or log energy ."
[19:05] mn052 | We can see that .
[19:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[19:11] mn052 | Hmm .
"[19:18] me018 | So do you have more , Stephane , or ?"
"[19:43] me006 | the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that I want to classify ."
"[19:55] me006 | I would do a phone um , phone recognition experiment , um , somehow"
"[20:00] me006 | putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that I have about voicing ."
"[20:08] me006 | um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those LNA files ,"
[20:20] me006 | that these phones are not voicing .
[20:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:25] me006 | um , I would say ,"
"[20:27] me006 | uh , go into the corresponding LNA file and zonk out the the posteriors for ,"
"[20:33] me006 | um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced ,"
[20:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[20:37] me006 | and then see what kinds of improvements I get .
[20:40] me018 | Hmm .
"[20:45] me006 | in terms of , like , which which , um which of these categories are are good for , um , speech recognition ."
[20:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:55] me006 | I hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in July ."
[21:06] me018 | the remaining ones ?
"[21:09] me006 | set to some really low number , the the non - voiced , um , phones . Right ? And then renormalize ."
[21:13] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:16] me018 | Mmm .
[21:19] me018 | Cool .
[21:20] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[21:20] me006 | Yeah .
"[21:21] me018 | That will be really interesting to see , you know ."
"[21:24] me018 | So then you 're gonna feed the those into some standard recognizer . Uh , wh are you gonna do digits or ?"
[21:25] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[21:33] me018 | With TIMIT . OK .
[21:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:40] me018 | Sorry . So where do the outputs of the net go into if you 're doing phone recognition ?
"[21:52] me018 | An - and you 're gonna the you 're gonna do phone recognition with that ? OK , OK ."
"[21:54] me006 | Phone recognition . Right , right ."
[21:56] me018 | I see .
"[21:57] me006 | So . And , uh , another thing would be to extend this to , uh , digits or something where I can look at whole words ."
"[22:06] me006 | And I would be able to see , uh , not just , like , phoneme events ,"
"[22:11] me006 | but , um , inter - phoneme events ."
[22:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:14] me006 | So , like , this is from a stop to to a vo a vocalic"
"[22:19] me006 | segment . You know , so something that is transitional in nature ."
[22:22] me018 | Right .
[22:24] me018 | Cool .
[22:24] me006 | Yeah .
[22:28] me006 | So that 's that 's it .
[22:32] me006 | Yeah .
"[22:33] me018 | Let 's see , I haven't done a whole lot on anything related to this this week . I 've been focusing mainly on Meeting Recorder stuff ."
"[22:39] me018 | So , um , I guess I 'll just pass it on to Dave ."
"[22:43] me026 | Uh , OK . Well , in my lunch talk last week I I said I 'd tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using that l um , long - term mean subtraction approach ."
[22:53] me026 | It turned out there was a bug in my Matlab code .
"[22:58] me026 | and , um , the results"
[23:01] me026 | were were better . I got intelligible speech back . But they still weren't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means .
"[23:11] me026 | And also I 've been talking to , um ,"
"[23:14] me026 | Andreas and Thilo about the , um , SmartKom language model and about coming up with a good model for ,"
"[23:21] me026 | um , far mike use of the SmartKom system . So"
"[23:25] me026 | I 'm gonna be working on , um , implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far - mike system for the SmartKom system , I mean . And , um ,"
"[23:35] me026 | one of the experiments we 're gonna do is , um , we 're gonna , um , train the a Broadcast News net ,"
"[23:41] me026 | which is because that 's what we 've been using so far , and , um , adapt it on some"
"[23:46] me026 | other data . Um , An - Andreas wants to use , um ,"
"[23:50] me026 | data that resembles read speech , like these digit readings , because he feels that"
[23:56] me026 | the SmartKom system interaction is not gonna be exactly conversational .
[24:00] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:03] me026 | S so actually I was wondering , how long does it take to train that Broadcast News net ?"
"[24:11] me026 | Two , three weeks ."
"[24:25] me013 | I 'm sorry , it was two , three weeks for training up for the large Broadcast News test set training set ."
[24:29] me013 | I don't know how much you 'd be training on .
[24:31] me026 | OK .
"[24:31] me013 | The full ? Uh , i so if you trained on half as much and made the net , uh , uh , half as big , then it would be one fourth the amount of time and it 'd be nearly as good ."
[24:38] me026 | OK .
[24:40] me026 | OK .
"[24:49] me013 | uh , uh m"
[24:50] me013 | other ways of taking care of the phase .
[24:52] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:53] me013 | So , I mean , I I guess that was something I could say would be that we 've talked a little bit about you just doing it all with complex arithmetic"
"[25:01] me013 | and not not , uh , doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase . But"
[25:12] me013 | effects of the average complex spectrum .
"[25:17] me026 | And , um ,"
"[25:23] me026 | So , phases get added , modulo two pi ,"
"[25:27] me026 | and because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi . And so I thought at first , um ,"
"[25:39] me026 | Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all ."
[25:49] me018 | Hmm .
[25:49] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[25:52] me013 | Yeah .
[25:53] me013 | P So .
[25:56] me026 | And that 's all I have to say .
"[26:03] me013 | is something the average phase is something that we do want to remove . I mean , maybe there 's some"
"[26:06] me013 | deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do . But , um ,"
"[26:10] me013 | at least in principle it looks like there 's there 's , uh , a couple potential ways to do it . One one being to just work with the complex numbers ,"
"[26:18] me013 | um ,"
"[26:19] me013 | and , uh in rectangular kind of coordinates . And the other is"
[26:29] me013 | Well . So you work with the complex numbers
"[26:35] me013 | um , actually divide it out ,"
"[26:38] me013 | um , as opposed to taking the log and subtracting ."
"[26:41] me013 | So then , um ,"
"[26:43] me013 | um , you know , there might be some numerical issues . We don't really know that ."
[26:48] me013 | The other thing we talked a little bit about was Taylor series expansion .
"[26:52] me013 | And , um , uh , actually I was talking to Dick Karp about it a little bit , and and and , since I got thinking about it , and and , uh ,"
"[27:05] me013 | we may have to do this on a whiteboard , but I think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you 're"
[27:27] me013 | cuz it 's a expansion of log one one minus epsilon or o is is
"[27:33] me013 | one plus epsilon ,"
"[27:35] me013 | or is it one plus ? Well , there 's an epsilon squared over two and an epsilon cubed over three , and so forth . So if epsilon is bigger than one , then it diverges ."
[27:37] me026 | OK .
"[27:46] me013 | of K times a complex number , then you can just that 's the same as log of K plus log of the complex number ."
[27:54] me026 | OK .
[27:56] me013 | converges . But .
[27:59] me018 | Hmm .
"[28:08] mn052 | And , uh ,"
[28:10] mn052 | I I actually thought it was it was doing
"[28:20] mn052 | like , worse results than not using it ."
"[28:24] mn052 | So , I 've been trying to find where the problem came from . And then it looks like I have some problem in"
"[28:32] mn052 | I I mean , i uh , it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse . I was looking at the spectrograms that I got"
"[28:46] mn052 | Oh , yeah . I actually implemented the Wiener f f fil filtering as a module and then tested it out separately . And it it it gave , like I just got the signal out and it it was OK ."
"[28:50] me013 | Yeah , I see ."
"[28:51] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[28:56] mn052 | So , I plugged it in somewhere and then I mean , it 's like I had to remove some part and then plugging it in somewhere . And then I in that process I messed it up somewhere ."
"[29:03] mn052 | So , it was real"
"[29:04] mn052 | I mean , I thought it was all fine and then I ran it , and I got something worse than not using it ."
"[29:09] mn052 | So , I was like I 'm trying to find where the m m problem came , and it seems to be , like , somewhere some silly stuff ."
[29:23] me013 | Right .
[29:24] me013 | Yeah . As as he is wont to do . Yeah .
"[29:33] mn052 | stuff . And then he showed up and then I told him . And then he gave me a whole bunch of filters what Carlos used for his , uh ,"
"[29:44] mn052 | uh , thinking of using that also in this , uh ,"
"[29:47] mn052 | W Wiener filtering because that is a m modified Wiener filtering approach , where instead of using the current frame , it uses"
"[29:56] mn052 | So instead of designing our own new Wiener filters , I may just use one of those Carlos filters in in this implementation and see whether it it actually gives me something better"
[30:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:11] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:20] mn052 | And
[30:21] mn052 | the the other thing was about the subspace approach .
"[30:26] mn052 | So , um ,"
"[30:28] mn052 | I , like , plugged some groupings for computing this eigen uh ,"
[30:37] mn052 | I just @ @ some small block of things which I needed to put together for
"[30:41] mn052 | the subspace approach . And I 'm in the process of , like , building up that stuff ."
"[30:54] mn052 | I guess Yep . I guess that 's it . And , uh , th th that 's where I am right now ."
[30:59] mn052 | So .
"[31:01] me018 | Oh . How about you , Carmen ?"
[31:03] fn002 | Mmm . I 'm working with VTS .
"[31:06] fn002 | Um , I do several experiment with the Spanish database first , only with VTS and nothing more . Not VAD , no LDA , nothing more ."
[31:17] me018 | What what is VTS again ?
"[31:20] me018 | Oh , yes . Right , right ."
[31:21] fn002 | To remove the noise too .
[31:24] fn002 | What ?
"[31:28] me013 | So , that 'd be good from for analysis . It 's good to have some , uh , cases of the same utterance at different different times . Yeah ."
"[31:37] fn002 | Well , um , the question is that Well ."
[31:46] fn002 | m m
"[31:47] fn002 | the , em ,"
"[31:49] fn002 | VAD , the result is better . And we put everything ,"
"[31:55] fn002 | the result is better , but it 's not better than the result that we have without VTS ."
"[32:01] fn002 | No , no ."
[32:09] fn002 | Is not .
[32:10] me013 | Do you How much of that do you think is due to just
[32:19] mn007 | Are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation or ?
[32:24] mn007 | Or i ?
[32:28] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:28] fn002 | f
"[32:29] fn002 | onl eh , to use on only one fair estimation of the noise ."
"[32:39] fn002 | um , a lying estimation of the noise ."
[32:46] fn002 | n
"[32:47] mn007 | Maybe you have to standardize this thing also , noise estimation , because"
[32:55] mn052 | Mmm .
[32:55] mn007 | They all need some some noise noise spectra but they use every all use a different one .
"[32:56] fn002 | No , I do that two t did two time ."
"[33:03] me013 | If if , uh , uh , y you 're right . I mean , each of these require this ."
"[33:07] me013 | Um , given that we 're going to have"
"[33:10] me013 | for this test at least of uh , boundaries ,"
[33:12] me013 | what if initially we start off by using known
[33:17] me013 | sections of nonspeech for the estimation ?
[33:19] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[33:19] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[33:23] me013 | Right ?
[33:23] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
"[33:25] me013 | first place , I mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries ,"
"[33:36] me013 | you know , relatively , uh , unhelpful result that you 're getting in this or this or this is due to"
[33:41] me013 | some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks and how much of it is just due to the fact that you 're not accurately
[33:47] me013 | finding enough regions that that are really
[33:48] mn052 | Mmm .
[33:50] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[33:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[33:52] me013 | Um .
[33:55] me013 | you 'd have more reliable stretches of nonspeech to do the estimation from and see if that helps .
"[34:02] fn002 | Yeah . Another thing is the , em the codebook , the initial codebook ."
[34:11] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[34:18] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:33] fn002 | If this if this is the noise signal ,"
"[34:45] fn002 | uh , in the log domain , we have something like this ."
"[35:02] fn002 | Now , we have something like this ."
"[35:08] fn002 | n given a , um How do you say ?"
[35:08] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[35:16] fn002 | I i given
"[35:17] fn002 | is the estimate of the PDF of the noise signal when we have a ,"
"[35:24] fn002 | um ,"
[35:38] fn002 | Mmm ? This is the idea .
"[35:41] fn002 | Well , like , this relation is not linear ."
[35:43] fn002 | The methods propose to develop this in a vectorial Taylor series approximation .
"[35:56] fn002 | No , this in the it 's this is the log domain . I I must to say that ."
[35:59] me013 | Which is which is the log domain ?
"[36:01] fn002 | Is the T is egual is equal to ,"
"[36:05] fn002 | uh ,"
[36:11] me013 | And but Y is what ? Y of the spectrum or ?
"[36:17] me013 | No , no . The top Y is what ?"
[36:19] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:21] me013 | Is that power spectrum ? No , is that power spectrum ? Is it ?"
"[36:21] fn002 | Uh , this is the noisy speech ."
"[36:27] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[36:35] fn002 | Yeah .
[36:43] fn002 | Yeah . It 's the same .
[36:44] me013 | you just mean the log of the of the one up above .
[36:48] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:49] me013 | And , uh , so that is"
"[36:54] me013 | X times , uh ,"
[36:56] mn052 | One one plus N by X .
"[36:57] fn002 | But , n"
"[37:01] me013 | X times one plus , uh ,"
"[37:04] me013 | N uh , N N N minus X ?"
[37:08] fn002 | Yeah .
"[37:09] me013 | And then ,"
[37:10] fn002 | And the noise signal .
[37:16] me013 | Well .
[37:18] mn052 | One plus N by X .
[37:21] me013 | I actually don't see how you get that .
[37:23] me013 | Uh .
[37:24] mn007 | Mmm .
"[37:30] fn002 | E is equal , oh , to log of"
[37:37] me013 | Yeah .
[38:02] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[38:06] mn052 | No .
[38:08] me013 | That doesn't follow .
"[38:18] fn002 | We have first that , for example , X"
"[38:22] fn002 | is equal , uh Well ."
[38:27] me013 | Yeah .
"[38:31] fn002 | log of X omega , but , well , in the time domain we have an exponential ."
[38:39] fn002 | No ?
[38:41] fn002 | No ?
[38:49] me013 | Right ?
[38:51] me013 | The the the log of X plus N is not the same as the log of E to the X plus E to the N .
[38:57] fn002 | Yeah . But this i
"[39:06] fn002 | Well , the expression that appear in the in the paper ,"
"[39:16] mn007 | Is it the first - order expansion ? Yeah , I guess . Yeah . Uh - huh ."
[39:16] me013 | OK . I i
"[39:17] mn052 | Yeah , the first one . Yeah ."
[39:18] mn052 | Yeah .
[39:22] mn007 | Yeah .
"[39:30] mn007 | Yeah , but the the second expression that you put is the first - order expansion of"
[39:36] fn002 | Not exactly .
[39:37] me013 | No .
"[39:42] fn002 | Well , we can put that"
[40:00] me013 | That doesn't follow .
"[40:03] fn002 | Well , we can put , uh , this ?"
[40:03] mn052 | Mmm .
"[40:05] me013 | That I mean , that the f top one does not imply the second one ."
"[40:11] me013 | Because cuz the log of a sum is not the same as th I mean , as Yeah ."
[40:20] fn002 | E plus B is equal to log of E plus log
[40:25] me013 | Right .
"[40:26] fn002 | to B . And we can say here , it i"
[40:27] me013 | Right . So you could s
"[40:34] fn002 | And we can , uh , put this inside ."
[40:38] me013 | Yeah .
"[40:39] fn002 | And then we can ,"
"[40:40] fn002 | uh ,"
[40:45] fn002 | Yeah .
[40:46] mn052 | Uh .
[40:46] me013 | I don't see how you get the second expression from the top one .
"[40:54] me013 | if you say "" log of , um , A plus B "" ,"
"[41:04] me013 | or A plus B is not the ,"
"[41:07] me013 | um , log of E to the A plus E to the B ."
"[41:11] fn002 | No , no , no , no , no , no , no . This not . No ."
[41:13] me013 | Right ? And that 's what you seem to be saying .
"[41:25] fn002 | is equal to log of , uh in this side , is equal to log of X"
[41:31] me013 | Plus N .
[41:32] fn002 | plus N .
[41:33] me013 | Right .
[41:33] fn002 | No ? Right . This is right .
[41:34] me013 | Right . And then how do you go from there to the ?
"[41:37] fn002 | And then if I apply exponential ,"
[41:41] fn002 | to have here
"[41:42] me013 | Look . OK , so let 's I mean , C equals A plus B ,"
"[41:44] mn007 | It 's log o of capital Y . Yeah , right . Capital Y ."
[41:47] fn002 | Yeah .
"[41:51] mn052 | X . X . This is X , inside ."
[41:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[41:56] me013 | Right . Yeah . That one 's right .
[41:59] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:09] fn002 | S uh , i th we can put here the set transformation ."
[42:14] me013 | I see .
[42:15] fn002 | No ?
[42:16] me013 | I see .
"[42:21] fn002 | Yeah . In this case , well , we can put here a Y ."
"[42:29] me013 | that the , uh So , capital X is by definition the same as E to the little X because she 's saying that the little X is is the , uh is the log ."
[42:39] me013 | Alright .
[42:39] fn002 | Now we can put this . No ?
[42:41] me013 | Yeah .
[42:42] fn002 | And here we can multiply by X .
[42:46] me013 | different fonts there so you know which is which . But I I under I understand what you mean now . OK .
[42:52] me013 | Sure .
[42:56] fn002 | I can put log
[43:09] me013 | Yes . I understand now .
[43:12] me013 | And that 's where it comes from . Yeah .
[43:19] mn007 | Yeah . Right .
[43:21] me013 | Right .
[43:22] fn002 | Now it 's correct .
[43:23] me013 | Right .
[43:26] me013 | OK . Thanks .
"[43:27] fn002 | Well . The idea Well , we have fixed this equa"
"[43:31] me013 | OK . So now once you get that that one , then you then you do a first or second - order , or something , Taylor series expansion of this ."
[43:36] fn002 | Yeah . This is another linear relation that this to develop this in
[43:40] fn002 | vector s Taylor series .
[43:54] fn002 | when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech .
[44:04] fn002 | Mmm ?
"[44:13] fn002 | well , we know this"
[44:14] fn002 | statistic and we know the noisy st
"[44:17] fn002 | well , we can apply first"
"[44:20] fn002 | order of the vector st Taylor series of the of the of well ,"
"[44:25] fn002 | the order that we want , increase the complexity of the problem . And then when we have a expression , uh , for the"
[44:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:33] fn002 | mean and variance of the noisy speech ,"
[44:45] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[44:46] fn002 | to obtain the expected value
[44:50] fn002 | of the clean speech given the this
[44:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[44:58] fn002 | the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech .
[45:04] fn002 | This only that .
[45:08] mn007 | And the the model of clean speech is a codebook . Right ?
[45:12] fn002 | Yeah . We have our codebook
[45:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[45:47] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:50] me013 | So , um ,"
"[45:54] me013 | how much in in the work they reported , how much noisy speech did you need to get , uh , good enough statistics"
[46:04] me013 | for the to get this mapping ?
[46:10] fn002 | I I need to s I don't know exactly .
[46:11] me013 | Yeah .
[46:23] me013 | the the training set may not be a a great estimator
[46:28] me013 | for the noise in the test set . Sometimes it is and sometimes it 's not .
"[46:31] fn002 | Yeah . I the clean speech the codebook for clean speech , I am using TIMIT ."
"[46:37] fn002 | And I have now , uh , sixty - four"
[46:43] me013 | Uh - huh .
[46:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:53] me013 | And and you and you train it up entirely from , uh , nonspeech sections in the test ?"
[47:08] me013 | Yeah .
"[47:09] fn002 | uh , the compensation of the dictionary o one time using the the noise at the f"
[47:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[47:20] me013 | Yeah .
[47:24] fn002 | all the sentences .
[47:58] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:59] fn002 | This is one . Eh , this is the composition of the dictionary ."
[48:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[48:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[48:27] fn002 | the estimation of the clean speech
[48:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[48:30] fn002 | is equal at an expected value of
[48:40] fn002 | the probability f of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise .
[48:46] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[48:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[48:52] fn002 | And we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of E minus a function
"[49:10] fn002 | the term after develop this , the term that we we take ."
"[49:19] fn002 | Give PX and , uh , P the noise ."
"[50:16] me013 | No , no . I 'm sorry . In in the one you pointed at . What 's that variable ?"
[50:18] fn002 | v
"[50:23] fn002 | like this , but conditional . No , it 's condition it 's not exactly this . It 's"
[50:24] mn007 | It 's one mixture of the model . Right ?
"[50:30] fn002 | Uh , if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech , we have a"
[50:36] fn002 | probability f of our our weight for each Gaussian .
"[50:41] fn002 | No . And now , this weight is different now because it 's conditional . And"
[50:41] me013 | OK .
[50:45] me013 | Yes .
[50:46] fn002 | this I need to to calcu I know this and I know this because this is from the dictionary that you have .
[50:49] me013 | Uh - huh .
[50:52] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[50:53] fn002 | I need to calculate this . And for calculate this ,"
[50:54] me013 | Yes .
[51:41] fn002 | that .
"[51:42] fn002 | I can calculate I can I calculated this value ,"
"[51:47] fn002 | uh , with the statistic of the noisy speech that I calculated before with the VTS approximation ."
[51:55] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[51:59] fn002 | And I know everything .
"[52:02] fn002 | Uh , with the ,"
[52:14] fn002 | calculate the mean and the variance
[52:18] fn002 | of the for each of the Gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech .
[52:26] fn002 | Now .
[52:26] fn002 | And this is fixed .
[52:27] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:27] fn002 | If I never do an estimat a newer estimation of the noise , this mean as mean and the variance are fixed ."
[52:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:35] fn002 | And for each s uh , frame of the speech the only thing that I need to do is to calculate this"
[52:43] fn002 | in order to calculate
[52:45] fn002 | the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech .
[52:54] me013 | @ @
"[52:55] me013 | Are you saying that all of these estimates are done using , um ,"
[53:02] me013 | estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames ?
[53:09] fn002 | Yeah .
[53:09] me013 | And never change throughout anything else ?
[53:11] fn002 | Never cha This is one of the approximations that I am doing .
"[53:14] me013 | Per per per utterance , or per ?"
[53:17] me013 | Per utterance . OK .
[53:23] fn002 | Yeah .
"[53:24] fn002 | Yeah . It 's fixed , the dictionary . And the other estimation is when I do the uh on - line estimation , I change the means and variance of th for the noisy speech"
[53:25] me013 | OK .
[53:26] me013 | OK .
[53:35] me013 | Yeah ?
[53:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[53:43] fn002 | I do it uh again this
[53:48] fn002 | Estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech . And with th with this new s new mean and variance I estimate again this .
"[54:04] me013 | Uh , or is there some adaptation ?"
[54:12] me013 | OK .
"[54:26] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I know you don't have a lot of data to estimate with , but but , uh ,"
[54:36] fn002 | I estimate mean and variance for each one of the Gaussian of the codebook .
"[54:43] me013 | No , I 'm talking about the noise ."
"[54:44] fn002 | Oh , um . Well , only one I am only using only one . I don't know i"
[54:45] me013 | There 's only one Gaussian .
[54:48] me013 | Right .
[55:02] me013 | So this is twenty or something ? Twenty ?
[55:03] fn002 | Twenty - three .
[55:05] me013 | So it 's Yeah . So it 's actually forty numbers that you 're getting .
"[55:12] fn002 | Uh , the original paper say that only one Gaussian for the noise ."
"[55:20] fn002 | Yeah , maybe isn't the right thing ."
"[55:24] fn002 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[55:33] me013 | So , suppose you did This is almost cheating . It certainly isn't real - time . But if y suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given"
[55:43] me013 | or I I guess we 're gonna be given even better boundaries than that .
"[55:46] me013 | And you look you take all o all of the nonspeech components in an utterance , so you have a fair amount ."
[55:57] fn002 | Maybe .
"[56:05] me013 | based on the fact that you have poor boundaries for the , uh , uh , nonspeech ?"
[56:15] me013 | could you do better if you used more parameters to characterize the noise ?
[56:20] me013 | Um .
"[56:30] me013 | Um , if you do a second term does it get too complicated cuz of the nonlinearity ?"

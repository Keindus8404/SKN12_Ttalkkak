[00:00] me051 | Mm - hmm .
[00:00] me011 | And we 're on .
[00:02] mn014 | Time ?
"[00:06] me011 | So , topic number one is , we got the NSF ATR ITR , excuse me ,"
"[00:11] me011 | which was originally pretty big , but it 's divided among many sites ,"
"[00:19] me011 | So they they approved it for all the sites ,"
[00:22] me011 | but only gave us like sixty - two percent of the money .
"[00:25] me011 | Or , excuse me , cut it by sixty - two percent ."
[00:26] mn014 | Thirty - two . Yeah . Thirty . Whatever .
"[00:30] me011 | And the other condition is that they have to get a budget out , like , immediately ,"
[00:34] me011 | or the or they 'll give the money to someone else . So Morgan 's working on that .
[00:34] me018 | By next Friday .
[00:42] me018 | It 's more money .
"[00:45] me011 | long shot , and so it 's it 's really nice that we got that ."
[00:47] me001 | What does that stand for ?
[00:49] me011 | Information Technology Research ? Something like that ?
[00:50] me018 | Something like that .
[00:52] me001 | Alright .
[00:53] mn014 | Doesn't say much .
"[00:54] me001 | Yeah , it 's pretty vague . It 's government - run , I guess ."
"[00:58] me018 | Uh , I mean , we 're in conjunction with uh , SRI , Washington , and , um , Columbia ."
[01:01] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[01:04] me001 | OK .
[01:05] me018 | And to do research on the meetings .
[01:07] me001 | Cool .
"[01:07] me011 | Yeah , it was specifically on the meeting ."
[01:07] mn014 | Not great .
"[01:09] me011 | So , d was that the one that was the meeting maps ?"
[01:11] me018 | Yeah .
"[01:12] me011 | OK , good . I liked that one ."
[01:13] me018 | Yeah .
[01:14] mn014 | What is meet meeting maps ?
"[01:16] me011 | Well , the the sort of general idea was , you can think about meetings at lots of different levels ,"
"[01:21] me011 | all the way d from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue , discourse , topic ."
[01:24] mn014 | Yeah .
[01:26] mn014 | Yeah .
[01:27] mn014 | Yeah .
"[01:28] me011 | And so this this was , how do you map all that information onto that ?"
[01:32] me011 | a onto the meeting domain .
"[01:32] me018 | It 's like creating a m a map of a meeting , in a sense ."
[01:35] me011 | So that the the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions .
"[01:40] me011 | And so , uh ,"
"[01:41] mn014 | Uh , OK ."
[01:43] me011 | So this had a lot of different stuff in it .
[01:43] mn014 | OK .
[01:46] me018 | m
[01:47] me018 | speech
[01:48] mn014 | Yeah . Sure .
[01:49] me011 | It 's mostly higher level .
[01:50] mn014 | Yeah .
"[01:50] me018 | Higher level , yeah ."
[01:50] me011 | Yeah .
[01:50] mn014 | Yeah .
[01:54] me011 | It 's a it 's a cool idea .
[01:57] me011 | get it going that would be neat .
"[02:00] me011 | So And uh , this was the one also that was , uh ,"
[02:04] me011 | Was it with Susan Ervin - Tripp ?
[02:07] me018 | I don't remember .
[02:09] mn014 | With who ?
[02:12] mn014 | OK .
[02:14] me011 | Anyway .
"[02:15] me011 | So , other topics I wanted to talk about are , um ,"
"[02:20] me011 | the DARPA demo which , I guess , since Morgan isn't here we can't really talk about . I just wanted to make sure it was ready to go ."
[02:25] me001 | Yeah .
"[02:28] me011 | Your stuff is all ready so it 's just a question of , did Morgan get around to testing it ."
"[02:32] me001 | Yeah , and I sent you an email"
"[02:34] me011 | Yeah , I got it . With the instructions ."
[02:34] me001 | with the instructions .
[02:37] me001 | I guess Morgan 's leaving on Saturday ?
[02:39] me011 | Yep .
"[02:40] me001 | So until then ,"
[02:42] me001 | I guess we might
"[02:43] me011 | Yeah , so I guess we ge we had better be on call for a little while ."
"[02:45] me001 | Yeah , exactly ."
[02:48] me018 | Did he ever figure out how to d
[02:50] me018 | switch between applications like he was wanting to do ?
[02:52] me011 | I don't know . I haven't spoken with him .
[02:53] me001 | Yeah .
[02:53] me018 | He did ?
[02:53] me001 | Oh - Yeah .
[02:55] mn014 | Switch between applications ?
[02:55] me018 | How is he gonna do it ?
"[02:58] me001 | Like if you hold down Alt and then tap Tab , you just the s just the Task Manager w window comes up ."
[03:02] me018 | Right .
"[03:02] me011 | I think the problem was that , I was t saying "" hit Alt Tab "" with the assumption that he knew what I meant ."
[03:02] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:07] me011 | But he didn't . So .
"[03:08] me018 | No . He said he tried that , but he didn't like it"
[03:09] me001 | We -
"[03:13] me018 | it took it out of the , um ,"
[03:15] me011 | But it doesn't .
[03:15] me011 | It doesn't .
"[03:16] me001 | Well , because if you just touch Alt a If you just hit it once ? it 'll go back to the previous application ."
"[03:20] me001 | And the previous application was the PowerPoint demo ,"
[03:30] me011 | But of course he doesn't use Windows .
[03:30] me018 | Yeah .
[03:31] me001 | Right .
"[03:32] me011 | So ,"
[03:32] me011 | he didn't know what I meant .
"[03:33] me011 | Hold down at hold down Alt , and then tap Tab several times and you 'll cycle through all the open applications ."
[03:37] me001 | Yeah .
[03:38] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:41] me018 | And then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta
[03:42] me011 | Right .
[03:42] me001 | Right .
[03:42] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:43] me018 | Oh !
"[03:44] me001 | And I told them , um , if he decides to use multiple examples for , um , the prosody demo , to open up separate Transcribers ."
[03:50] me001 | Just so you don't have to load up files e during the meeting .
[03:53] me011 | That 's a good idea .
[03:53] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:54] me001 | So .
[03:54] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:55] me001 | He 's got the memory for it . So .
"[03:57] me011 | Yeah , and"
"[03:59] me001 | Yeah , they 're all really short ."
"[04:00] me011 | I mean the Tcl - TK overhead is pretty high , but it shouldn't matter ."
[04:03] me018 | How much memory does he have ?
[04:03] me001 | No . I didn't have any problems I 'm sorry ?
[04:05] me018 | How much memory does he have ?
"[04:06] me001 | I don't know , but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all . I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight ."
[04:08] me018 | Hmm .
[04:13] me018 | Hmm .
[04:16] me018 | Wow !
"[04:17] me001 | Yeah , it was fine . I think y"
"[04:19] me001 | Yeah , I mean I I I We kinda walked through it a little bit on his p on his laptop ."
"[04:25] me018 | So , are we the only ones who are giving demo ? Or is , uh ,"
[04:31] me018 | Washington gonna have a demo too ? or ?
[04:32] me011 | I assume . But they 're all doing Communicator stuff .
[04:36] me018 | OK .
[04:36] me011 | So .
[04:38] me018 | Hmm .
"[04:38] me001 | And it 's part of the talk itself , so it 's really not a big part ."
"[04:41] me018 | Yeah , I see ."
"[04:41] me011 | I mean , the talk 's only twenty minutes ."
"[04:43] me011 | So . You know , all this time we spent on it 's gonna be thirty seconds"
[04:45] me001 | I know . Right . Uh - huh .
"[04:49] me011 | Yeah , I"
"[04:52] me011 | Actually , both of them ."
[04:55] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:58] me011 | with the uh ,"
[04:59] me001 | Prosody ?
"[05:03] me011 | Um , so , actually , at some point w"
[05:05] me011 | we should talk to users of that technology who are actually gonna be using it and see what they would like to see .
[05:12] me018 | No .
[05:13] mn014 | Nope .
"[05:13] me001 | the prosody demo , we basically w loaded up um , word alignments . So , instead of having um , utterances in the bottom , it 's like just word by word ."
[05:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[05:24] me018 | Oh .
"[05:24] me001 | And then , um , Adam did something where , um , we converted these feature files into wave files ,"
[05:29] me001 | so you can display them .
[05:31] me018 | Display the features .
[05:31] mn014 | Instead of the wave file ?
[05:31] me001 | Yeah . Instead of the wave file . And then w using multi - wave you can add a file and play that sound .
[05:32] mn014 | Oh . OK .
[05:36] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:36] me001 | Play the audio corresponding to that ,"
"[05:38] me001 | um , um , feature file , and it 's all like , aligned and stuff ."
[05:38] mn014 | OK .
"[05:40] mn014 | Ah , great ."
"[05:41] me018 | So you see , like , the F - zero contour ?"
"[05:42] me001 | Yeah , so you see the pitch contours and you and when you hit play , like there 's a line that goes through it , you know , and it 's all aligned with like the t"
[05:47] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:48] mn014 | Oh , that 's great ."
[05:48] me011 | Audio .
[05:49] mn014 | Yeah .
[05:49] me011 | And the stylized F - naught features are pretty cool .
[05:49] me001 | feature file .
[05:52] me018 | Hmm .
[05:52] me001 | Yeah .
"[05:52] me011 | So , these this it 's - does a piece - wise linear and so , normally if you look at an F - naught track , it jumps all over the place ."
[05:57] me018 | Yeah .
[05:57] mn014 | Yeah .
[05:58] me011 | This is a nice smooth one and it really does a good job .
"[06:00] me018 | Oh , neat ."
"[06:00] mn014 | And there 's something like a median filter in it ? or something ? And uh , and it 's it 's a linear fit or whatever . Yeah ."
[06:03] me011 | It 's a combination .
[06:03] me001 | Yeah .
"[06:05] me001 | There 's a median filtering and then there 's a piece - wise linear fit ,"
[06:07] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:08] me001 | based on some criteria . I 'm not sure .
[06:09] mn014 | OK .
"[06:09] me011 | Uh , t"
[06:10] me011 | G Actually could you email me a reference to that paper ? If you have it ? Cuz I 'm sorta curious how what criteria it has .
"[06:13] me001 | Yeah , sure ."
"[06:14] me001 | I should email Morgan about it too , because he was asking about that ."
[06:19] me001 | Yeah .
"[06:19] me011 | I mean , so , there 's obviously a trade - off between the number of knots y you pick ,"
"[06:24] me011 | and the best fit . I mean , so , if you 're doing a piece - wise linear ,"
[06:27] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:27] me011 | you have to figure out how many pieces you want .
[06:30] mn014 | Yeah . Sure .
[06:32] me011 | the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots .
"[06:36] me001 | Right , well , then it 's not a linear f fit . You 're not fitting anything then ."
[06:36] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:37] mn014 | Yeah . Yeah .
[06:40] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:41] me011 | So so you There 's a trade - off and I 'm wondering what criteria they use .
[06:42] me001 | It 's kind of a useless one .
[06:46] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:52] me001 | who 's a co - worker with , uh , Liz ."
[06:52] me018 | Hmm .
[06:52] me011 | Dot com .
"[06:59] me011 | No , I you said "" at SRI "" so I had to add the "" dot com "" ."
"[06:59] me018 | No , i"
"[07:01] me018 | It sounded like a URL , the way you were saying it , yeah ."
[07:02] me001 | Oh .
[07:04] me001 | Sorry .
"[07:09] me001 | He did a paper on this for some v speech verification , uh , project , and"
[07:14] me001 | we basically
[07:18] me001 | what he did for that work and applied it to our files .
[07:21] me001 | That 's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody .
[07:24] me018 | the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here ? Or you grabbed code from somewhere else ?
"[07:28] me001 | No , we grabbed most of it . Like , we grabbed the linear fitting stuff . We did all the alignments and"
[07:30] me018 | Ah .
[07:31] me018 | I see .
[07:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[07:37] mn014 | And the
[07:37] me001 | the math was done somewhere else .
[07:38] mn014 | These are our F - zero candidates which I 'm supposed to use for the synthesis thing ?
[07:44] mn014 | I suppose ?
"[07:44] me001 | Uh , so that 's what you were working on , right ?"
[07:47] me051 | Right . That 's the same software I used to get the data .
[07:48] mn014 | Yeah . OK .
[07:50] mn014 | OK .
[07:53] me011 | Hmm .
[07:54] me051 | Right . Right .
[07:55] mn014 | Yeah .
[08:02] me011 | transcription status stuff . So we 've sent a few to them . We 've gotten a few back .
"[08:07] me011 | Um ,"
[08:11] me011 | Didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers ?
"[08:14] me018 | Yeah , it 's done now ."
"[08:15] me011 | And , how was it ?"
[08:16] me018 | She said it was much faster . It really helped a lot to have that .
[08:18] me011 | Great .
"[08:20] me018 | So , um , you know , there were a l"
[08:20] mn014 | Much faster than doing everything alone . OK .
[08:22] me011 | Hand .
[08:22] me018 | From scratch .
"[08:24] me001 | From end to en Like , from the beginning of the process to the end of the process ?"
"[08:26] me018 | No , f no . So from the point where we s take it , it 's faster ."
"[08:29] me011 | Well , but that 's what we wanted ."
[08:31] mn014 | Yeah .
[08:31] me011 | Right . We knew it would be longer to have multiple groups .
[08:32] me001 | Ooo . Yeah .
"[08:34] me018 | u So it 's sorta like doing things in parallel . You know ? So if ,"
[08:35] me011 | Right .
"[08:37] me018 | you know , if they can be working on that while we 're working on the other things , then when we get them in ,"
"[08:38] me011 | Well , pipelined ."
"[08:41] me018 | they don't have to do that one from scratch , basically ."
[08:43] me001 | Right .
[08:43] me011 | The idea is that we 're taking less time of the linguists . Of the transcribers . So .
[08:46] me001 | Right .
[08:48] me001 | S
"[08:48] me018 | Yeah , th Right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM , part There 's there 's several problems . One is , um ,"
"[08:56] me018 | we were giving them these large files , which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes ."
"[09:01] me018 | So either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes , so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them ."
[09:02] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:07] me018 | So one of the things that we did is , Adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want , uh ,"
"[09:14] me018 | basically ,"
"[09:15] me018 | uh , chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty - five minutes ."
[09:19] me018 | And then we can give those to IBM and it 'll make it easier for them to put them on tape .
"[09:30] me018 | to our project , but are in use for all IBM projects , and IBM has recently giving given them"
"[09:37] me018 | uh , a whole bunch of stuff . So it 's gonna , sort of delay us ."
[09:40] me011 | We might wanna revisit hiring our own external transcription company .
"[09:45] me011 | Because I think that would be cheaper than having our people do it , but do it with the same process with these beep files ."
"[09:50] me018 | Hmm , that 's an interesting idea ."
"[09:51] me011 | I mean , cuz , originally I had disc"
[09:54] me011 | discounted that because it was just gonna be too hard . But now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out .
"[09:58] me018 | Yeah . So the only difference would be , we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM ."
[09:59] me011 | Then maybe it would be OK .
[10:02] mn014 | Yeah .
[10:02] me011 | Yep .
"[10:03] me018 | And then we could send If if we had that process down , of putting the audio onto tape ,"
[10:08] me018 | we can send IBM the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape
[10:10] me011 | And we might wanna do that anyway . Because it seems like that 's being a bottleneck and that 's silly . It shouldn't be a bottleneck .
[10:15] me018 | Yeah .
"[10:18] me018 | Well , u u"
"[10:19] me018 | So , I don't know where the bottleneck was . Was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the"
[10:24] me018 | appropriate size chunks ? or was it actually putting it onto the tape ?
"[10:27] me011 | It may well have been partially that , you know , because they tried it , and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps , and go forward in the file , et cetera , et cetera . But , uh ,"
[10:32] me018 | Exactly .
[10:33] me018 | Yeah .
[10:35] me018 | Yeah .
"[10:43] me011 | Get a tape deck ,"
[10:44] mn014 | Yeah .
[10:44] me018 | Yeah .
"[10:45] me011 | plug it in to the computer , hit record ,"
[10:45] mn014 | Plug it into the sound card .
"[10:48] me011 | on the tape deck ,"
[10:48] mn014 | Yeah .
"[10:49] me011 | and just do it all all uh ,"
"[10:51] me018 | So plug i So , like , the headphone output in the back of the computer ?"
[10:52] me011 | analog .
"[10:54] me011 | Well , line out ."
"[10:54] mn014 | Line out , yeah ."
[10:57] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[10:58] me001 | Hmm .
[10:58] mn014 | Yep .
"[10:59] me018 | Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy ."
[11:05] me011 | digital analog tapes where it 's controlled by the computer .
[11:09] me018 | Mmm .
[11:10] me011 | But w
[11:11] me011 | But we don't need to do that . The the disadvantage of doing it this way is it 's real time . So you would have to sit there for an hour while it 's recording .
"[11:18] mn014 | Yeah , but you Yeah . Pfff . Yeah ."
[11:19] me011 | Right . It 's not a big deal .
"[11:20] me001 | So , what 's the turn around period right now from IBM ?"
[11:25] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:28] me018 | Since we started doing this new , uh , beep format with "" beep number beep "" ,"
"[11:33] me018 | they 've given us , uh , I think , two full ,"
"[11:36] me018 | uh , transcripts . They have a third one and Brian just sent me a note saying "" oh , that"
[11:41] me018 | third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr of the
"[11:43] me018 | eh transcriptionists ' , uh , s company "" ."
[11:45] me001 | Mmm .
"[11:47] me018 | And so there 's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back . And I 've already given him three more to work on , but he said those new three"
[11:51] me001 | OK .
[11:55] me018 | won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company .
[11:59] me001 | OK .
"[12:00] me001 | And the transcribers here are still , uh are working , though ."
"[12:03] me018 | Yeah . Yeah , they 're working away ."
"[12:04] me001 | Th - they 're just doing their own thing , like , while they 're waiting . OK ."
"[12:12] me018 | well , into the the , uh , master sheet here with the statuses and I pick ones that Thilo has , um , pre - segmented , and I change the status to "" Trans - IP IBM "" ,"
[12:15] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:22] me018 | so that , you know , when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those ."
[12:28] me018 | So I 'm not picking
"[12:29] me018 | huge chunks , right now , of meetings"
[12:34] me011 | Brian
[12:35] me011 | if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape . Is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that ?
[12:42] me018 | Mm - hmm . That 's a good idea .
[12:46] me011 | And then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us . I mean the o the other problem is you would wanna r do it on an unloaded machine .
[12:53] me011 | Right ? Because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering .
[12:54] mn014 | Yep .
[12:56] mn014 | Yeah .
[12:58] me018 | Huh .
[13:00] me011 | And that means That that 's more of a problem because y then you have to be there .
[13:03] mn014 | Yeah .
"[13:05] mn014 | And all of the P Cs are connected to the network , too , here . Or , uh , bad ."
[13:05] me001 | What i
[13:08] me011 | Right .
"[13:12] me001 | recording it , like , real - time ?"
[13:14] me011 | Yep .
[13:15] me001 | Oh .
"[13:16] me018 | So when that thing When it stutters like that , is it because there 's a delay getting the data off a disk ? Or is it because there 's a delay in the D to A ?"
[13:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:23] me011 | It could be either . I mean , there are lots of different places . It can be delay on the disk , or it can be just load"
[13:24] me018 | OK .
[13:28] me011 | gets high on the machine .
[13:29] me018 | Yeah .
"[13:30] me011 | Um , either IO load or processor load ."
[13:33] me018 | I see .
"[13:34] me011 | You know , it 's a problem with these multi - user systems is that"
[13:37] me011 | lots of processes are running and you don't t really have control .
[13:40] me018 | Maybe we could do it from a w a PC or something .
[13:41] me011 | Wha -
[13:42] mn014 | Yeah .
"[13:43] mn014 | But they are also on the networks , so ."
[13:43] me018 | Yeah .
"[13:45] me051 | If you used a line out , too , you have to worry about if you click around and you"
[13:45] mn014 | Maybe .
[13:49] me051 | hit a beep or something .
[13:51] me051 | It 'll beep onto onto the tape too .
[13:53] me018 | Hmm .
[13:55] me018 | Mmm .
[13:57] me001 | And you have to record every channel separately .
"[13:59] me011 | No , because we 're doing the beep files ."
[14:00] mn014 | The beep files .
"[14:01] me001 | Oh , OK ."
"[14:08] me018 | and just dedicate it to doing this . Not even hook it u Well ,"
[14:14] me011 | Yep .
"[14:14] me018 | Uh ,"
[14:16] me011 | Or you could just You could have it no active connection . Just SCP them .
[14:20] me018 | Yeah . Right .
[14:22] me018 | And then just use that machine to hook up to the tape .
"[14:24] me011 | Actually , it wouldn't be bad to have that , plus put on that machine a CD burner ."
[14:29] mn014 | Yep .
[14:29] me018 | Yeah .
"[14:30] me018 | We don't need a powerful machine to do these things , right ? So , one of these old"
[14:32] me011 | No .
[14:36] me018 | Hmm .
[14:37] me018 | Should talk to him about that .
[14:38] mn014 | Or even a DVD burner .
"[14:39] me011 | A DVD burner , yeah ."
"[14:47] me011 | I mean , it it 's not a big deal , but it 's yet another thing you have to do ."
"[14:50] me018 | Yeah , yeah ."
[14:57] me001 | They couldn't use C Ds ?
"[15:00] me011 | No , because the transcription company does what they do ."
"[15:02] me018 | They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that . So ."
"[15:06] me001 | Oh , I see ."
[15:08] me001 | I see .
[15:12] me018 | I guess they haven't
[15:14] me011 | Actually there are a few I saw a web - based one at one point .
[15:14] me018 | got a p
[15:17] mn014 | Web - based ?
[15:17] me011 | Where you could send them audio files over the web and they send you back text files over the web . I should look that up again .
[15:20] me018 | Really !
[15:24] me018 | Y can you send them huge audio files ?
[15:26] me011 | Mmm . Mmm .
[15:29] me011 | I assume that you can send them anything that they can access
[15:33] me018 | Huh !
[15:33] me011 | with HTTP .
"[15:36] me001 | Well , they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they 're transcribing , anyway ."
[15:36] me018 | That 's interesting .
[15:39] mn014 | Yeah .
"[15:40] me018 | Well , that 's true ."
[15:43] me001 | an utterance or two .
[15:44] me018 | Are How big are these files that we send to Brian ?
[15:47] me011 | Half a gig .
[15:49] me018 | Really ? That big ?
"[15:51] me011 | Oh , no , wait . They 're the beep files . Yeah , it 's a p hundred meg . They 're the beep files . That 's right . So they 're smaller ."
"[15:51] me018 | I thought it was , like , a hundred megs ."
[15:55] me018 | Yeah .
[15:57] me018 | Hmm .
[15:58] me018 | That 's still pretty dang big .
"[16:03] me011 | And we are sending them the compressed ones , right ?"
"[16:07] me018 | I don't know . Wha - whatever you generate . Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed ."
[16:09] me011 | Yeah .
"[16:12] me011 | Were "" shortened "" . Yeah ."
[16:12] me018 | Yeah .
[16:14] me018 | Wonder if the ones before that were shortened .
[16:16] me011 | Yeah .
"[16:17] me011 | The beep files , actually the "" shorten "" doesn't save a whole lot ."
[16:20] me011 | Right ? Because the whole point is that it 's extracting pie pars parts that are loud anyway .
[16:21] mn014 | It 's all speech . Yeah . Yeah .
[16:25] me018 | Mmm .
[16:25] me011 | So .
[16:26] me018 | Hmm !
[16:34] me018 | Hmm !
[16:38] me011 | see what 's gonna happen . Nothing else really to do .
"[16:41] me011 | Um ,"
[16:44] me011 | We have new equipment that I 'm gonna try to set up tomorrow .
[16:48] me011 | New wireless .
[16:49] me018 | What will that do ? Is that going to ?
[16:54] me011 | Yep .
[16:54] me018 | Oh ! That 'll be nice .
[16:55] me011 | Yep .
"[16:57] me011 | But it involves rewiring . And so , if I could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon"
[17:03] me018 | I should be around .
"[17:03] me011 | to help my brain . You know , just have someone to bounce"
[17:07] me011 | the instructions off of and make sure I don't do anything too stupid .
"[17:12] mn014 | Yeah , sure ."
[17:15] me011 | Did I have another topic on the on the list ?
[17:17] me018 | Experiments ?
[17:20] mn014 | Experiments ? Yeah .
"[17:21] me018 | Yeah , I guess that 's probably next . Yeah ."
[17:21] mn014 | These are next week .
[17:21] me011 | Wha - what did I have on the agenda I mailed out ?
"[17:23] me001 | I think it was Oh yeah , I don't know ."
"[17:25] mn014 | The demo ? Demo and IBM , I think ."
[17:26] me001 | The demo was one of them .
[17:27] me018 | Demo .
"[17:28] me011 | Yeah , that 's it . That was it ."
[17:28] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:28] me001 | Yeah . I think that 's it .
[17:29] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:30] me018 | Yeah .
[17:30] mn014 | Short meeting ?
[17:31] me018 | Yeah .
[17:31] me011 | Short meeting ? Does anyone have anything else ?
"[17:36] me018 | Oh , but that 's not specific to Meeting Recorder . I was gonna say I"
"[17:40] me018 | a suggestion of Adam 's , and I , um ,"
[17:43] me018 | created a m CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks .
[17:50] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:50] me018 | So if you go to the speech local web page , and then there 's a disk status page . You can click on that and it 'll"
"[17:57] me018 | query Abbott , and"
"[17:58] me018 | give you a a list of all the disks that we have and then , uh , what 's on each one , and then it shows"
[18:04] me018 | how big the disk is and what percent full it is .
[18:06] me001 | Cool .
"[18:06] me018 | So . And that 's , you know , each time you go there , it 's updated . So ."
[18:11] me018 | The new disks are installed . If you need space just let me know . I have to create
"[18:15] me018 | the p appropriate sub - directory . So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where"
"[18:21] me018 | we put a y a U doctor speech data , and then"
[18:32] me001 | OK .
[18:32] me011 | Do we have new DD disks also ?
[18:34] me018 | No .
[18:35] me011 | Darn .
[18:35] me018 | No .
[18:36] me018 | Nnn .
"[18:36] me011 | So , it 's all just scratch ."
[18:38] me018 | It 's all scratch .
[18:38] me011 | OK .
[18:39] me018 | Yeah .
"[18:46] me011 | No , DE is full . We must be doing it on D F ."
"[18:49] me018 | No , it 's D E ."
"[18:50] mn014 | D E , I think , yeah ?"
[18:50] me018 | D E 's not full .
[18:51] mn014 | D D is full .
[18:52] me018 | DD 's full . That was the first one .
"[18:54] me018 | Or , that was the last one that w"
"[18:56] me018 | filled up , and DE still had like , last time I looked it was like seven gigs or something . So ."
"[18:56] me011 | OK , I guess I 'm just one off ."
[19:00] me011 | OK .
"[19:03] me018 | a gig , and so ."
[19:04] me011 | So that means we 're p getting pretty close .
[19:05] me018 | We 're getting close . Yeah . So .
[19:12] me018 | Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year . Like when we get around a hundred
[19:14] me001 | OK .
[19:16] me001 | OK .
[19:16] me018 | meetings .
"[19:17] me018 | Um , because there 's gonna be data coming from UW , hopefully by then ."
[19:20] me001 | Cuz u
[19:21] me011 | I just hate not to get data .
[19:21] me001 | How m
[19:24] me011 | Yeah .
"[19:26] me001 | Yeah , it 's like you build this room up for so long , and then it 's just like , you stop ."
"[19:30] me018 | Now that we 're used to recording , it 's like , eh , well , why not keep going ?"
[19:37] me011 | And try to convince other topics to come in and do some . Cuz I think that would be nice .
[19:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:43] me018 | We have right now , like , seventy - five or seventy - six hours"
"[19:48] me011 | Yeah , the other thing we were talking about also is once we exp once"
[19:48] me018 | of meetings .
"[19:51] me011 | the disk has been backed up , we don't actually need it on - line ."
"[19:57] me011 | So another option is to copy it to tape manually so we have the back - up copy and the tape copy ,"
[20:03] me011 | the archive copy and the back - up copy . And then just take them off - line .
[20:10] me011 | Once we have the expanded versions . So if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do
[20:13] me018 | Oh .
[20:17] me018 | Yeah .
[20:20] me011 | And then not necessarily have the original data on - line .
"[20:29] me018 | e e We can't add anymore disks to it . We can increase the size of the disks that are on it , but that"
"[20:34] me018 | will only take us so far . So ,"
"[20:36] me018 | um ,"
"[20:37] me018 | David had the suggestion about , you know , new servers and things like that , and so I 'm gonna"
[20:42] me018 | see if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server .
"[20:50] me011 | Well , that would be pretty tight i in the machine room ."
"[20:53] me018 | Yeah , it would have to replace Abbott , basically ."
"[20:56] me018 | Yeah . Well , he David 's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers ."
[21:01] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[21:02] me018 | I think he wants to sorta go with the same type
"[21:08] me018 | Yeah , it 's full in there . Have you seen it recently with all of the new"
[21:19] me018 | So .
[21:20] mn014 | But they are not yet
[21:22] mn014 | accessible ? The new machines ?
[21:23] mn014 | Yeah ? They are ?
[21:25] me011 | What are they called ? What are they named ?
[21:26] mn014 | Yeah .
[21:27] me018 | Oh ! I 've forgotten now . Um .
"[21:31] me018 | Yeah . They 're in the P - make pool . So if you do a "" reginfo minus show attribute "" , and"
[21:36] mn014 | A what ?
[21:37] me018 | A r
[21:38] me011 | P - make stuff . P - make magic . Or customs magic .
[21:39] me018 | Yeah . Y
"[21:41] me018 | You can get a list of all the machines that are available to P - make , by using the command "" reginfo"
[21:44] mn014 | OK .
"[21:46] mn014 | "" Reginfo "" , OK ."
[21:50] mn014 | Maybe you can send me that .
[21:50] me018 | Yeah .
"[21:53] me011 | If you do "" man customs "" , it has almost all of that ."
[21:55] mn014 | OK .
"[21:56] me018 | And I for I 'm not sure what attributes we attach to the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds , but it could be SB - one - hundred . And so if you"
"[22:04] me018 | query for f all machines that have that attribute , then you should see the names of the new machines . But ."
[22:05] mn014 | OK .
[22:07] mn014 | OK .
[22:09] me011 | Do we have an attribute for non - interactive machines ?
[22:12] me011 | Cuz I was thinking that would be a good one to have .
[22:15] me011 | Ones that aren't on people 's desks .
[22:26] me018 | Which
[22:27] me018 | is roughly that .
[22:29] me011 | Y right .
"[22:29] me018 | It 's Although it 's like it h My machine has it on my desk . So , I do get jobs running on my machine all the time ."
"[22:37] me018 | Um ,"
"[22:38] me018 | But , uh ,"
[22:40] me018 | So so that 's that 's sort of what it is .
[22:42] me011 | Yep .
[22:43] me018 | Uh - huh .
[22:44] me011 | Anyway .
[22:45] me011 | Shall we do digits ?
[22:46] me018 | Sure .
"[23:37] me051 | One three , five four , one two , two three , seven zero ."

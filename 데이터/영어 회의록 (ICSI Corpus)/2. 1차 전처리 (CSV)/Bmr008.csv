"[00:00] fe016 | Yeah , I do it"
[00:01] me013 | OK
[00:03] me013 | Yeah .
[00:04] me018 | I just tried it . I think my head is too big .
[00:05] me011 | So .
"[00:06] fe016 | My head 's too big , also . It 's too ba"
"[00:06] fe008 | And there is a problem that you can hear it come and go ,"
"[00:08] fe008 | cuz when you turn your head , then"
[00:10] me018 | Oh yeah .
[00:11] mn005 | Yeah .
"[00:12] fe016 | Oh , that 's true ."
[00:13] me013 | so let 's uh
[00:14] fe016 | course that 's true of a lapel as well .
[00:17] me013 | Let 's discuss agenda items . What did we have ?
[00:18] fe008 | Yes .
[00:19] me013 | uh You you were
[00:20] me013 | announce some things
[00:22] me011 | about forms in general .
"[00:23] me013 | OK , forms"
[00:27] me013 | status on on the uh
[00:33] me013 | discussion which will take us about thirty seconds
[00:33] me011 | Stuff .
"[00:39] me013 | uh , the one among us who 's actually doing a bunch of things on this"
"[00:46] me013 | I was just glancing through it , so I think we"
[00:47] me013 | have something to discuss about .
[00:49] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[00:50] me013 | um
[00:52] me013 | and
[00:54] me013 | um
[00:55] me013 | We just sent in that uh
[00:58] me013 | NSF pre - proposal but I don't think there 's much to say about that except
[01:01] me013 | we 've sent it in and
[01:05] me013 | um
[01:08] me013 | Anybody ? Anything ?
[01:09] me013 | Anything else going on ? No . OK .
[01:12] me013 | So
[01:13] me013 | Why don't we do it in that order ? Go ahead .
[01:14] me011 | OK .
[01:15] me011 | I uh probably should have printed out more of these .
[01:17] me011 | So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time .
"[01:26] me011 | So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once ."
"[01:30] me011 | And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down"
[01:33] me011 | and you can look it up from the speaker form .
"[01:35] me011 | so , I had a first pass of it ,"
[01:36] me011 | and I
[01:40] me011 | what language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it .
[01:45] me011 | And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it .
[01:49] me011 | And I only did one copy which was really stupid of me .
[01:52] me011 | um
[01:53] me011 | So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around .
"[01:57] me011 | uh , Name , Sex"
[01:58] me011 | Email or Other Contact Information .
"[02:00] me011 | And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name ,"
"[02:03] me011 | so that you can distinguish them ,"
[02:05] me011 | and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form .
[02:11] me011 | how we get at the background .
"[02:13] me011 | And we could do profession , but"
[02:14] me011 | it 's so uniform
[02:16] me011 | that we figured what was more important
[02:17] me011 | was actually the education level .
[02:20] me011 | um
[02:23] fe008 | and it 's also relevant to status .
[02:25] fe008 | I c I can insert that .
[02:25] me011 | And s and relevant to status .
[02:26] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[02:27] me011 | So that what I have is
[02:28] me011 | uh
[02:28] me018 | Status ?
[02:29] fe008 | Which might in af affect the discourse aspects .
"[02:32] fe008 | So , go ahead ."
"[02:32] me018 | Oh oh , stats kind of status , OK ."
[02:33] fe008 | His Uh - huh . Yeah .
"[02:34] me011 | So uh , I have uh ,"
"[02:36] me011 | five things that you can circle ,"
"[02:38] me011 | Undergrad , Grad ,"
"[02:39] me011 | Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other ."
"[02:44] me011 | So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors ,"
[02:50] me011 | US education levels .
[02:54] me011 | help to translate what that means .
[02:57] me013 | How fine a resolution do you need on that
[02:59] me013 | for this ?
[03:01] mn005 | Is the question .
[03:02] me013 | maybe not so much .
[03:03] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:03] me018 | Student , Non - student ."
[03:05] fe008 | Oh I think undergrad is useful .
"[03:09] fe016 | Can you just write something like "" position "" ?"
"[03:11] fe016 | and people can fill in their own you know ,"
[03:12] me013 | P prone .
[03:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:14] fe016 | "" Post - doc "" or "" visitor "" or whatever ."
[03:15] me018 | Sitting .
"[03:16] me011 | Well , the problem with that is"
"[03:18] me011 | um , I think the same as the problem of profession ."
[03:25] me011 | or something at that granularity .
[03:27] fe016 | oh .
[03:28] me011 | So
"[03:28] me011 | I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th"
[03:31] me011 | At least I don't feel like there is .
[03:33] me011 | um
[03:34] me011 | I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be .
[03:38] fe008 | I think that so
[03:39] fe008 | Uh did are were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this ?
"[03:43] me013 | No , no . Less ."
[03:43] me011 | Less .
[03:43] fe008 | Less ? What would you suggest as a as a change ?
"[03:46] me013 | Um ,"
[03:49] me013 | Hmm
[03:51] me013 | um
[03:54] me013 | I don't really know .
"[03:55] me013 | I mean , were you thinking , uh , that it"
[03:57] me013 | would be useful for some research later
"[03:59] me013 | to know say , you said undergrad for instance , so , undergrad versus grad , do you think that 's important ?"
[04:01] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[04:03] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:03] fe008 | I do , and the reason is because I think that"
[04:04] me013 | OK .
"[04:06] fe008 | um , well having been a grad student as , yeah ,"
"[04:09] fe008 | a as others here ,"
"[04:10] fe008 | at at Berkeley ,"
"[04:12] fe008 | that , um ,"
[04:12] fe008 | I think there 's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad
[04:16] fe008 | in terms of like the status .
"[04:17] fe008 | I mean , I mean you notice it in various ways , like"
[04:19] fe008 | simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours .
"[04:28] fe008 | and help helpers , you know , in in"
"[04:30] fe008 | research , uh"
"[04:35] fe008 | that they In terms of like the s the social dynamics of interactions ,"
[04:38] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[04:39] fe008 | I would expect them to be
[04:41] fe008 | less deferent .
[04:42] fe008 | and um
[04:43] me013 | I see .
[04:44] fe008 | maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that .
"[04:47] fe008 | I don't think that we 're going to have a lot of undergrads ,"
[04:50] me011 | Right .
"[04:52] me018 | You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ?"
[04:57] fe008 | This is the dimension .
"[04:58] fe008 | Well , this is the dimension ."
"[04:59] me011 | Well , one of the one of the criteria"
[05:00] fe008 | One one dimension .
"[05:01] me011 | I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet ."
[05:05] mn005 | Yeah .
[05:05] me011 | And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also .
[05:07] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:08] me011 | Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a"
[05:13] me011 | uh
[05:14] me011 | social dynamics expert
[05:15] me011 | being the one who 's filling out the answers . I want it to be self - evaluating . You
[05:18] me011 | can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking .
[05:19] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:21] fe008 | And it 's non - threatening , I mean , this this compared to , you know ,"
[05:22] me011 | Yep .
"[05:27] me018 | Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that . You need to know sort of"
"[05:31] me018 | Bas - in in this meeting ,"
[05:33] me018 | sort of what is your social status ?
[05:33] me011 | That 's a separate question .
[05:35] me011 | We 'll
"[05:36] fe008 | Well , I agree with him , though . I Yeah ."
[05:36] me011 | get to that in a moment .
[05:37] fe008 | But I I agree that this is
[05:38] fe008 | that w
[05:39] fe008 | the rea the motivation was
[05:40] fe008 | things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research
[05:43] fe008 | without being threatening to the person .
"[05:47] me011 | I know . So , this particular form"
"[05:50] me011 | is dependent only on the speaker , not on the meeting ."
[05:50] me018 | Yeah .
[05:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[05:52] me011 | You could imagine then having another form
[05:55] me011 | that you might want to do during a meeting
[05:57] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[05:57] mn005 | Yeah .
[05:59] me011 | But then that 's interfering with the meeting .
"[06:00] me011 | So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once ,"
"[06:03] me011 | and they fill it out once ,"
[06:05] me011 | and and then you have that information .
"[06:07] fe008 | well ,"
[06:07] fe008 | and we also discussed the idea of having
[06:07] me018 | I g
[06:07] me013 | I
[06:09] fe008 | the separate D T Ds would handle
"[06:11] fe008 | maybe , s specific meeting - specific things that might be relevant ."
[06:13] me013 | DTD ?
"[06:14] fe008 | uh , the data , so that , you know , his XML thing ?"
[06:17] fe008 | You got
[06:17] me013 | Oh .
[06:19] fe008 | the Document Type Definition p part
"[06:19] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[06:19] mn005 | Ah .
[06:20] mn005 | Yeah .
"[06:21] fe008 | that it 's can s be used for relational things , yeah ."
[06:21] mn005 | Yeah .
[06:22] mn005 | DTD .
[06:23] me013 | See -
[06:24] me018 | I guess it seems to me like you know I trying to
[06:27] me018 | deduce information about the person 's status
"[06:35] me011 | Not at all . I mean , the fact that"
[06:36] me011 | one person 's an undergrad and the other 's a full professor is interesting .
"[06:40] me011 | So , the question is how much of this information"
"[06:43] me011 | um ,"
"[06:43] me018 | But , that will depend on what the meeting 's about ,"
[06:44] me011 | can y
"[06:46] me011 | Well , absolutely !"
[06:46] mn005 | @ @
[06:48] me011 | But but you want to have that information .
"[06:50] me011 | Right ? So , if you don't have that information ,"
[06:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[06:53] me011 | how are you gonna do anything ?
[06:53] me018 | I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion
[06:56] me013 | yeah
"[06:56] me018 | based on that ,"
[06:58] me018 | if you don't know about the meeting ?
"[06:59] fe008 | Well , you know , we 're we 're talking at at a general level of description . You can always get more specific ."
[07:02] me013 | yeah
"[07:05] me011 | I mean , so what would you suggest ?"
[07:07] me018 | That 's why I was wondering about if you can put something about the d
[07:08] me013 | Right .
[07:09] fe016 | Can you repeat the categories you had ? Maybe they 're fine .
[07:10] mn005 | Yeah .
"[07:11] me011 | Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other"
"[07:14] fe016 | So that , yeah , I think that 's fine"
"[07:17] fe016 | thing is there are a lot of ICSI v like I don't know what I would be here , just"
"[07:22] fe016 | So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y I mean a"
"[07:22] me011 | oh , that 's right , you know I was saying "" Professor "" ."
[07:27] me011 | Uh - huh .
[07:27] fe016 | Visiting S
"[07:28] me011 | Yeah , when I said "" Professor "" , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more"
[07:28] fe016 | Researcher or whatever .
"[07:32] me011 | "" PHD but not Post - doc "" ."
"[07:35] me013 | Yeah , how about"
[07:35] me013 | Post - PHD researcher or something
[07:38] fe016 | then I think what you have is great .
[07:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:39] me013 | Right ?
"[07:42] fe008 | "" Post - PHD Researcher "" ?"
"[07:45] me011 | change "" Post - doc "" to "" PHD "" ?"
[07:47] me011 | Because I think PHD and Professor are d are
[07:49] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:50] me011 | distinct aren't they ?
[07:51] me013 | Yeah .
"[07:51] fe016 | Wait , what 's a PHD ?"
[07:52] mn005 | It 's possible .
"[07:52] fe016 | Like , if you have a PHD"
[07:53] me011 | Someone who has a PHD .
"[07:54] fe016 | and you 're hanging around here , and you 're not a professor"
[08:00] fe016 | so
[08:01] fe016 | There 's a bunch of people like that .
"[08:03] me013 | Um , this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the Spanish program"
"[08:08] me013 | uh , when we said , in our original forms , "" post - doc """
"[08:10] me013 | what we were used to , from the German program and from the US standard ,"
[08:11] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:14] me013 | when you say "" post - doc "" it meant somebody who had just gotten a PHD"
[08:16] fe016 | Right .
[08:17] me013 | who was doing one year someplace .
"[08:18] me013 | But when we did the Spanish call ,"
[08:19] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:20] me013 | many people said "" oh I want to be"
"[08:22] me013 | uh have a post - doc slot "" and they were"
[08:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[08:23] me013 | twenty years out
[08:24] fe016 | Right .
[08:24] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:25] me013 | because they were "" post """
[08:25] fe016 | Right .
[08:28] fe016 | Yeah .
"[08:29] fe016 | So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or"
[08:30] mn005 | Sure .
[08:32] fe016 | what if there 's one more category that 's sort of
[08:32] mn005 | Right .
[08:34] fe016 | general like that .
[08:34] me013 | It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting
[08:40] me013 | is really
[08:40] me013 | I think it 's going to be so clouded by everything else Someone who 's
[08:43] me013 | just gotten their PHD
"[08:45] me013 | uh , could be very very"
"[08:47] me013 | uh , strongly opinionated about something and somebody who 's been twenty years out"
"[08:50] me013 | could be shy , you know , s"
"[08:51] me011 | So , maybe Undergrad , Grad ,"
[08:51] fe008 | Mm - hmm . That 's true .
[08:51] mn005 | Yeah .
[08:53] me011 | Post - PHD and Other ?
"[08:55] me013 | What 's "" Other "" ?"
[08:59] fe008 | It 's just to allow .
[08:59] me011 | If i
"[08:59] fe016 | You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something ."
[09:00] mn005 | Yep .
[09:05] me011 | instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ?
"[09:06] fe016 | No , instead of Post Post - doc or Post - PHD ,"
[09:09] fe016 | just wrap all the people that are post PHD
[09:12] fe016 | and non - professors together .
"[09:16] me011 | So ,"
[09:17] fe016 | I think professors probably want it I don't care .
"[09:19] me011 | Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ?"
[09:20] fe016 | Yeah .
"[09:23] fe016 | Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like"
[09:26] fe016 | Post -
[09:27] fe016 | Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or
[09:30] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[09:30] fe016 | whatever . Yeah .
[09:31] me011 | Right .
[09:31] fe016 | Then it 'd be fine .
[09:32] fe016 | I think it 's fine .
"[09:32] me013 | So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler even though I know that more detailed means"
[09:37] me013 | more potential information for someone later who 's doing research in in this area
[09:44] me013 | making me lean toward simpler where possible is that
[09:49] me013 | Many of the meetings that we record
"[09:51] me013 | uh , may be the kind where we just record somebody once"
[09:56] me013 | even though we want to get a lot of data that has
"[09:59] me013 | uh , many meetings with the same people ."
[10:01] me013 | And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms
[10:03] me013 | that 's th the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do .
[10:07] fe008 | That 's true .
"[10:07] me011 | Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse ."
[10:13] me011 | Right .
[10:13] me013 | Right . And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds .
[10:16] me011 | I guess we could have another type of form for
[10:19] fe016 | Yeah .
[10:19] me011 | less frequent .
[10:21] fe008 | he d he wants you to do this only once for each person ?
[10:23] me013 | Yes .
"[10:24] fe008 | OK , OK ."
"[10:26] me013 | What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data ,"
[10:29] me013 | a chunk of it will be
"[10:30] me013 | uh , the same people many times"
[10:32] me013 | and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with
[10:34] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:35] me013 | from different people and I think it 's use We 've talked about this before , it 's useful to have both kinds of data ."
[10:38] me013 | I think .
"[10:39] me011 | Well I think that if if we 're planning to do that ,"
[10:41] me011 | then we should probably have another set of forms .
[10:43] me013 | OK .
"[10:44] me011 | You know , a single form that 's the consent form"
[10:46] me011 | and the speaker information form and not have them do digits .
[10:49] me013 | OK .
[10:52] me018 | the status information because I think you probably can get a lot of
[10:55] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[10:55] me018 | interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that .
[10:57] me018 | I 'm wondering
[10:58] me018 | could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting
[11:03] me011 | This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this .
[11:04] me018 | Yeah .
[11:06] me018 | OK .
"[11:06] me011 | So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss ."
"[11:09] me011 | um ,"
[11:11] me018 | I guess I was thinking
"[11:12] me018 | maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ? Could we"
[11:15] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[11:16] me018 | put one more thing on here maybe ?
"[11:19] me011 | Yeah , I 'm I have that as a topic , also ."
[11:20] me018 | OK .
[11:23] me011 | speaker form and then we 'll get over o get over to that one .
[11:24] me018 | OK .
"[11:26] me011 | So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ."
[11:31] mn005 | OK .
[11:31] me011 | um
"[11:32] me011 | and then I put "" Optional """
"[11:34] me011 | with a big "" Optional "" in parentheses , Age ."
"[11:37] fe016 | Wait , why is that optional ?"
[11:39] me011 | Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down .
[11:42] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:42] me011 | So I don't want to make them feel like they have to .
[11:48] fe016 | I don't know .
[11:48] fe016 | It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes .
[11:51] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:51] fe016 | I mean
"[11:57] me018 | Oh , right ."
"[11:57] me013 | Well , wait wait wait wait a minute , um ,"
"[11:59] me013 | It 's not illegal or anything right , it 's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal , whatever , to ask for their age , right ?"
"[12:02] fe016 | No , not at all , every most corpora have that , you know ,"
[12:05] me013 | I suggest you ask for their age
[12:06] fe016 | information .
[12:07] me013 | and if they say I don't want to give it say OK .
[12:10] mn005 | Yeah .
"[12:11] fe008 | they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact . So they say , you know , uh"
"[12:17] fe008 | middle thirties ,"
[12:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[12:21] fe008 | and they just they estimate for the person
"[12:26] me011 | saying Optional , Age ,"
[12:27] me011 | again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this .
"[12:31] fe016 | yeah , that 's OK ."
[12:31] fe008 | Yeah .
[12:32] fe008 | And it isn't it isn't that boldf
[12:32] me011 | And having a little instruction sheet and say
"[12:34] me011 | "" If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . """
[12:35] me013 | I see .
[12:36] fe008 | Yeah .
[12:36] me018 | Yeah .
[12:37] me011 | So .
"[12:41] me018 | How about "" optional but highly desirable "" ?"
[12:46] fe016 | Age or Approximate Age .
"[12:48] fe016 | So somebody can say "" thirties "" if they 're thirty - nine ."
"[12:48] fe008 | Actually , "" approximate "" ?"
[12:50] me013 | opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ?
"[12:54] me011 | Yeah , right ."
"[12:55] fe016 | Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you"
"[12:58] me018 | Yeah , If not given we will estimate ."
"[13:05] mn005 | I think it 's not necessary to put uh "" Optional "" ."
[13:09] mn005 | I think people
"[13:11] mn005 | decide uh , in that moment ."
[13:12] fe016 | I I think people in Speech are gonna wanna
"[13:14] mn005 | Because if you put "" Optional , """
[13:15] me018 | They 're very strong - willed .
[13:16] me018 | You know ?
"[13:18] me011 | Well , I think"
[13:19] me011 | maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age .
[13:22] fe016 | They can always lie .
"[13:24] me011 | But , I would rather let them leave it blank than lie ."
"[13:26] fe016 | OK , in some sense you could say that"
"[13:28] me011 | That 's why I want to put s "" Optional , Age "" ,"
[13:30] me018 | He -
"[13:30] fe016 | but don't lie . """
"[13:30] me011 | so that if they don't want to put it ,"
[13:32] me011 | they leave it blank .
[13:33] me013 | They might lie anyway .
[13:34] mn005 | Yeah .
"[13:34] me011 | But if you put "" Optional "" , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ?"
[13:37] me013 | I don't know .
[13:38] me011 | OK .
[13:40] me013 | I mean I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think
[13:44] me013 | would just lie about it .
[13:45] fe016 | Right .
"[13:45] me011 | You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says has a big "" Optional "" right next to it ?"
[13:45] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:47] me018 | You know people who lie about it ?
[13:48] me013 | Oh yeah .
[13:50] fe016 | Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known
"[13:53] fe016 | but it says "" optional "" they might"
"[13:55] me013 | Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years ."
[13:56] fe016 | not .
"[13:57] fe016 | Anyway , it 's fine"
[13:58] fe016 | I don't know .
"[13:59] fe008 | Well , the thing abou"
"[14:04] fe008 | uh , made the form seem gentler and k and"
[14:06] fe008 | not as intrusive kind of thing .
"[14:08] fe008 | Yeah , I noticed , I was afraid you 'd I shouldn't say that ."
[14:08] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:10] fe008 | They uh that , you know , i if you"
[14:15] fe008 | if people who get nervous about the age question then they
[14:18] fe008 | realize that
"[14:19] fe008 | "" Oh well , but they 're not trying to ask me lots of things . """
[14:22] me013 | I don't think it matters .
"[14:28] me011 | I think it 's better to put "" Optional "" . I mean , that 's why I put it there , s but"
[14:28] fe016 | OK .
[14:29] me018 | OK .
[14:30] mn005 | OK .
[14:30] me011 | it seems like maybe you disagree .
[14:30] mn005 | OK .
[14:32] me013 | I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's
[14:36] me013 | an important point the other way and I don't
[14:37] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:37] me018 | Yeah .
"[14:38] fe016 | Yeah , it 's OK ."
[14:41] mn005 | Hmm .
"[14:42] fe016 | As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form ."
"[14:48] me011 | Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional ,"
[14:49] fe008 | Let 's see .
"[14:50] fe016 | that 's the only optional thing , OK ."
[14:50] fe008 | That 's the only other one . That 's the only one .
[14:51] me011 | So .
"[14:53] me011 | Um , and then the next are two sections"
[14:55] me011 | One
"[14:56] me011 | indented separately . So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers ."
"[15:01] me011 | OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English"
"[15:04] me011 | with three circle boxes American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in ."
[15:10] me013 | who was telling was it Steve ? Somebody was telling us about
"[15:14] me013 | asking about uh ,"
"[15:17] me011 | Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem"
"[15:20] me011 | that it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway ,"
[15:23] me011 | and so I don't want
[15:24] me011 | to have to be standing over the person and asking them
"[15:28] me011 | "" Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was"
"[15:32] me011 | British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to """
"[15:36] fe008 | Well also ,"
[15:37] me011 | and so on .
[15:38] fe008 | he has a sep separate subject for Region .
[15:40] me013 | Uh - huh
[15:41] fe008 | and so it 's a self - assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English . And then
"[15:48] fe008 | of region . Now , we discussed maybe indicating a t a time frame . So ,"
"[15:52] fe008 | "" Where did you live during your , you know , childhood and adolescence ? """
[15:53] me011 | Right .
[15:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[15:56] me018 | Which is more objective .
"[15:58] me018 | than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that ."
"[16:01] fe008 | Yes . Mm - hmm . Although you know I mean a lot of people there won't be , e much"
"[16:05] me011 | I mean , th there 's room on the form to put"
"[16:05] me013 | I I I 'm sorry , so you 're saying"
"[16:07] me011 | al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be ."
"[16:11] me013 | uh I I I just missed something , though . Are you saying that you have both ?"
[16:18] me011 | the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region .
[16:22] me013 | Yeah .
[16:23] fe008 | And that 's partly to pick up Yeah .
[16:24] me011 | And then we have another form later down which is
"[16:27] me011 | um , list other language influences ."
[16:29] fe008 | S Mm - hmm
"[16:31] me018 | Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing ."
[16:31] fe016 | and like
[16:35] fe016 | Region .
"[16:36] me011 | Right , neither would I ."
"[16:36] fe016 | Do you want to have give choices and have them circle one , or , I mean"
[16:40] fe008 | When we when we discussed it it was it was
[16:43] fe008 | where where you lived during your childhood and adolescence .
[16:46] me011 | If you 're American English it would be region of the US .
[16:48] me018 | OK .
[16:48] fe008 | W it 's where you lived .
[16:49] me011 | That that so that 's why I didn't have circle forms . Because
[16:49] fe016 | but I mean .
[16:51] me011 | it would be different depending on
"[16:56] me018 | Do you mean state , or do you mean more broad than the state level ?"
[16:59] me013 | Hmm .
[17:00] me018 | You mean like you know
"[17:01] me018 | southern US , or northeastern or"
[17:03] me011 | It - I think it would be however you would identify
"[17:06] me011 | your own . And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle"
"[17:11] me011 | there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for"
[17:12] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[17:14] me018 | If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT .
"[17:14] me011 | you know , one for each type ."
[17:18] me018 | They had divided things up into
[17:20] me011 | But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form
[17:20] me018 | regions .
"[17:23] me011 | for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English ."
"[17:25] me018 | No , no . It would only be f"
[17:26] me018 | if you said American English
"[17:27] fe016 | yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough"
"[17:28] me018 | then you 'd put the regions . For the others , you would just leave it ."
[17:30] fe016 | people to really group them
[17:33] me018 | difference on those .
[17:39] mn005 | Hmm .
[17:41] fe016 | so .
[17:42] me013 | Yeah .
[17:43] fe008 | I haven't seen what what they did in TIMIT .
"[17:47] me018 | Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something . Very just a limited number and then"
[17:48] me013 | Yeah .
[17:49] fe008 | I see .
[17:50] me013 | Yeah .
[17:51] me018 | if you 're American you would just circle
"[17:51] fe008 | Well , that 's the concept , yeah ."
[17:53] me018 | the region
[17:54] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:54] me013 | Yeah , and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from ."
[18:00] fe008 | It would be no problem to change it to options if um if that were desirable . Although for different
"[18:04] me011 | Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other"
[18:06] me011 | varieties of English .
"[18:07] fe008 | Well , that 's true . I mean , Indian English I wouldn't know f"
[18:07] me018 | You 'd just leave them .
[18:09] me018 | You don't even ask .
[18:09] fe016 | I I there are huge differences
[18:12] fe016 | you know
"[18:12] me011 | Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down ."
[18:13] fe016 | in the others so it might be
[18:16] fe016 | better to just do it for the
[18:20] fe016 | for the others but have circled choice for the American English .
[18:25] me018 | One one good reason to use the TIMIT ones is if anybody asks you
"[18:28] me018 | you know , about the data later on you can say "" well I chose these"
"[18:31] me018 | based on TIMIT "" ,"
[18:31] fe016 | Right .
[18:31] fe008 | That is kind of nice .
[18:31] me013 | What what about
[18:33] me013 | just doing
"[18:35] me013 | the the sort of the Steve suggestion ,"
"[18:37] me013 | uh , as as an add - on to it , right ? Rather than saying Region ,"
[18:41] me013 | just say
"[18:42] me013 | "" Where did you live between the ages of"
"[18:45] me013 | here and here ? """
[18:45] fe008 | That was the concept of region .
[18:46] me018 | And that would apply to everybody then ?
"[18:47] me018 | Yeah . And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to ."
[18:48] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[18:49] fe008 | It 's just the wording of it .
[18:50] me013 | And then they they could s
[18:51] me018 | Yeah .
[18:51] mn005 | Yeah .
[18:52] me018 | That 's more general .
[18:54] me018 | Yeah .
[18:55] me018 | That 's true .
[18:55] mn005 | Yeah .
[18:57] fe016 | Actually
"[19:02] fe016 | levels of resolution in your survey , it it 'll be more of a pain later , so ."
"[19:06] me011 | Well , there could be a circle one ."
[19:06] fe016 | It depends .
[19:08] fe008 | I guess there 's a
"[19:13] fe016 | Yeah , that that 's good but if you have it totally free - form"
[19:17] me011 | Yeah .
[19:17] fe016 | First of all some people take you
[19:18] me018 | A lot of post - processing .
"[19:19] fe016 | Well , and some people would give you more specific"
[19:21] fe016 | information than others and that 's a waste because you can only use
[19:25] fe016 | the least common denominator of specificity and
[19:27] me013 | but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right
[19:28] fe016 | generally .
[19:32] me013 | categories are .
"[19:33] me013 | um ,"
[19:34] me013 | Right ?
"[19:35] fe016 | I don't know later on , if if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said"
[19:38] me013 | Yeah .
[19:40] fe016 | you know area then
[19:41] fe016 | that 'll have to become your category .
[19:46] me013 | I see .
[19:46] fe008 | There is another problem .
[19:47] fe016 | It 's easier for the person but it 's harder for the r it
[19:50] fe016 | actually less informative for us because you can't enforce
[19:52] fe016 | any minimum level of specificity .
[19:55] me013 | But I think that if you 're going to have it be general
[20:06] me013 | The idea the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might
"[20:14] me013 | you know , if you say your native"
"[20:19] me013 | you grew up in Germany , uh"
"[20:22] me018 | Yeah , y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle"
"[20:25] me018 | in this whole thing , which is that just asking them where they grew up"
"[20:29] me018 | between certain ages isn't enough , because"
[20:30] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[20:31] me018 | somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base
[20:34] me018 | speaking English .
"[20:34] fe008 | Yeah . Or someone could in Geor - in in New York and have , I mean , any number of different types of speech patterns ."
[20:35] fe016 | Or their parents live yeah .
"[20:44] fe008 | Well , we have this We hafta So . He hasn't given you the overview ,"
"[20:48] fe008 | but you have , like , the Native Speaker category , the Non - native Speaker category , and then you have"
"[20:57] me018 | Oh that 's nice , OK ."
[20:57] fe008 | Now there 's this issue of
"[20:59] fe008 | not wa like you 're saying ,"
[21:00] fe008 | you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting to complete .
[21:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:03] fe008 | So ,"
[21:04] fe008 | it 's trying to e there 's this trying to trying to hold this balance between the amount of information needed and
"[21:10] fe008 | uh , you know , not taking too much meeting time , and then in addition , add to it the third level of the balance , uh , um this this issue of not being too intrusive ,"
[21:18] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:18] fe008 | asking in a way that they don't mind .
"[21:18] fe016 | If we release this corpus , what do we want , I mean"
[21:22] fe016 | if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended
"[21:29] fe016 | then you need someone needs to enter that , and they 'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use"
"[21:34] fe008 | Well , I think rea I think that"
[21:40] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:42] fe008 | And in terms of the more open ones , we have the we 're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who"
[21:49] fe008 | will be participating in the meeting data . We can
[21:54] fe016 | Mmm .
"[21:55] me013 | Yeah , and the question is how"
"[21:55] fe016 | I mean , I guess what you really want , is if"
[21:56] me013 | extensive this gets .
"[21:57] fe016 | there 's some information you wanna know So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically ."
[21:57] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[22:02] fe008 | That 's it .
"[22:02] fe016 | then we should have some question where it 's not free form , except for these people who are"
[22:08] fe016 | who have
"[22:10] fe016 | non - American English accents . There we probably have to have a category "" Non - American English "" and then a few choices ."
[22:17] fe016 | And we should have something
"[22:19] fe016 | that 's simple , that people can circle ,"
[22:21] fe016 | like
"[22:21] fe016 | these TIMIT regions or something , so that we have something"
[22:25] fe016 | that minimally you can cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use . They 're gonna want some small set of
"[22:32] fe016 | places , and then , but anything additional people can fill out , and we can put it in as a note or something , but if we don't have that , someone 's gotta sit there and figure out"
"[22:41] fe016 | you know , I 've got twenty people who said"
"[22:44] fe016 | Midwest , and I 've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or these"
[22:48] fe008 | Well -
"[22:50] fe008 | we 're going a little bit in a circle ,"
"[22:51] fe008 | because I like the TIMIT suggestion very much ,"
"[22:53] fe008 | and I think it 's a question of how to ge incorporate it ,"
"[22:55] fe008 | and and we 've already suggested I mean ,"
"[22:57] fe008 | it 's come up in this discussion , that the suggestion"
[22:59] fe008 | that
"[23:00] fe008 | we could have um the TIMIT categories for the American ,"
"[23:04] fe008 | and and then make the choice or not ,"
"[23:07] fe008 | as to whether we do it for British ,"
"[23:08] fe008 | I mean , w we sort of discussed one way or the other , and it"
[23:10] fe008 | doesn't matter to me .
"[23:11] fe008 | I don't know if Adam has has a preference ,"
"[23:13] fe008 | but we could have you know , a sub a sub - categorization for American ,"
"[23:17] fe008 | We could even use the TIMIT subcategorization . I don't know if it has one for British , or whatever ,"
[23:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:21] fe008 | But you know , just have it you know , a short simple form that you can categorize yourself"
[23:26] fe008 | in a in a systematic way .
[23:28] me013 | What about
[23:28] me013 | the the phrasing that
[23:30] me013 | um
"[23:31] me013 | Chuck used , uh which was"
[23:34] me013 | in in relation to the question I was trying to
[23:37] me013 | formulate of uh
[23:40] me013 | where did you what what was that what w how did you phrase it ?
[23:42] me011 | What language was spoken in the home ?
"[23:43] me013 | "" What language was spok "" , yeah , so it 's not where did you grow up , but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of , what would it be , five and twelve or something like that ?"
[23:48] mn005 | Mmm . Yeah .
"[23:52] me011 | Depends of who you ask , what the age range is ."
"[23:53] fe016 | Well , in the home , the influence of the home is much lower age than that , I mean once you go beyond the age five or six"
[23:56] mn005 | Yeah .
"[24:03] fe016 | and yeah , so In the home it 's sort of your phonetic first level ,"
[24:08] fe016 | um a -
[24:10] fe016 | So it 's you know it starts to get sort of complicated .
[24:12] me011 | So so th
"[24:12] fe008 | It 's that 's not a problem though , I mean ."
"[24:13] fe008 | That would be a good question to ask , and then you could add a question . You know ,"
[24:16] fe008 | would uh
"[24:16] fe008 | "" among your peers "" ."
[24:18] fe008 | Specify the age range .
[24:21] fe016 | Right .
"[24:22] me011 | Well , the way it 's phrased right now ,"
[24:24] me013 | Yeah .
[24:25] me011 | it 's clearly asking about language .
"[24:28] me011 | And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak . Now , I think that"
[24:30] fe016 | Right .
[24:32] me011 | the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak .
"[24:36] me011 | But , other than having a trained linguist"
"[24:39] me011 | interview them and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it ."
[24:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:44] me011 | Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay say is "" Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it ,"
"[24:52] me011 | and now list the ones in preschool and now list the ones in first grade and now list the ones your friends speak """
"[24:56] me018 | Sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up ."
"[25:00] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
[25:00] me011 | Right .
[25:01] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[25:01] me011 | So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form
[25:01] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[25:04] me011 | at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes .
"[25:08] fe008 | and then we like I said , we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people ."
[25:11] fe008 | and being able to ask them follow - ups if we need to .
"[25:13] me013 | For now , right so it 's I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out , yeah ."
[25:14] fe008 | For now .
[25:15] fe008 | That 's true .
"[25:16] fe008 | Washington and stuff ,"
[25:17] fe008 | yeah .
[25:18] fe008 | That 's true .
[25:19] me011 | So I think that adding the the TIMIT
"[25:21] me011 | categories is a good idea , because that 's very easy for a person to fill out ."
[25:24] me011 | But I think we still have this problem of
[25:27] me011 | is it gonna be a self - evaluation ?
[25:29] me011 | or are we gonna ask them
"[25:31] me011 | "" what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher "" w"
[25:35] me011 | What 's the best way of phrasing the question ?
"[25:36] me018 | Well , you know the other thing , too , is that"
[25:38] me018 | it seems like th one of the reasons you would gather
[25:42] me018 | real detailed information about their
[25:44] me018 | native language is if you were gonna do fine - grained phonetic analysis or something .
[25:48] me013 | And somebody might .
[25:49] me011 | Or adapta or adaptation .
"[25:50] fe016 | but most of those people don't rely on the self - evaluations , anyway . They 'll probably listen to the speech , so"
"[25:57] fe008 | Well , I you know , I w"
[25:58] fe008 | e
"[25:58] fe008 | that 's a good point ,"
"[25:59] fe008 | but I was thinking uh , you know , with reference to"
"[26:01] fe008 | the language model issue , which"
[26:02] fe008 | uh
"[26:03] fe008 | and I guess it could be done inductively ,"
"[26:05] fe008 | but if you have a bunch of , say , R - less dialects and"
"[26:11] fe016 | They have information sort of like TIMIT I don't know it 's how well they categorized ,"
[26:20] fe016 | I mean
[26:21] fe016 | most of the people from cer certain places in the South were
[26:24] fe016 | from
"[26:25] fe016 | specific Texas locations , but"
[26:33] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Interesting .
[26:34] me018 | Were they putting down where they lived
[26:39] fe016 | Um
[26:39] me018 | Rather than where they grew up ?
"[26:40] fe016 | No , the question was really"
[26:42] fe016 | geared towards trying to get people 's self - evaluation of their
[26:43] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[26:46] fe016 | dialect
[26:46] me018 | Mmm .
[26:47] fe016 | region .
"[26:49] fe016 | and you know , for instance , you know , Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally these were all settled by very different type people , so"
[26:49] me018 | Yeah .
[26:50] fe008 | any region .
[26:54] me013 | Right .
[26:54] fe008 | Interesting .
[26:59] fe016 | it it 's sort of a general help
"[27:01] fe016 | but I think that anyone who 's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that , they would probably use it as a first pass or something ,"
"[27:06] me018 | So , then we probably don't need the fine - grained information ."
[27:08] me011 | Then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask .
[27:10] me018 | Yeah .
"[27:15] fe016 | but we don't need to ha be really really specific about the others , because it won't be very w helpful anyway ."
[27:18] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:19] me011 | Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable ."
[27:27] fe016 | It 's sort of a political thing .
"[27:28] fe016 | And there are some general like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category ."
[27:35] fe016 | but it 's not
[27:36] me018 | It can't be relied on only .
[27:38] fe016 | Right .
"[27:39] me011 | The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other ."
"[27:44] me011 | So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties ."
[27:47] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:48] fe016 | But Other is there , and people will fill that out . They 'll see by example . Yeah that 's I think that 's fine , they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these , I 'm"
[27:49] me011 | e
[27:50] me011 | But do you think those three are OK ?
"[27:52] me018 | Yeah , I think those are good ."
[27:52] me011 | OK .
[27:55] me013 | Yeah .
"[27:55] fe016 | Canadian , or"
"[27:56] me013 | So internally , we have Texas and other ."
[27:56] mn005 | Hmm .
"[27:58] me011 | So that for the Eng - native English speakers , we 'll do variety of English ,"
[28:00] fe016 | Right .
"[28:02] me011 | regions from the TIMIT labels , and another field ."
[28:07] me011 | And then
[28:10] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[28:16] me018 | Yeah .
[28:16] fe008 | Well that 's what
"[28:17] fe008 | the final the fin the third category was designed to do ,"
"[28:20] fe008 | because I mean , you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York"
[28:24] fe016 | Oh yeah .
[28:28] me013 | mm - hmm
[28:30] fe008 | You know . There are lots of things that are
[28:30] fe008 | very identifiable as
"[28:33] fe008 | you know ,"
"[28:33] fe008 | other other aspects ,"
[28:34] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[28:35] fe008 | which is why we have this third category . So
"[28:38] fe008 | certainly distinguish American versus British ,"
"[28:40] fe008 | and other types at that level ,"
"[28:42] fe008 | and then allow people to self - identify if there are other specific things ,"
"[28:45] fe008 | and then in addition , this issue of regions"
[28:48] fe008 | with some sort of
[28:49] fe008 | time frame for the re region because I think that if you live
[29:00] fe008 | So if you lis
"[29:00] fe008 | if if you You know . So , region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest ."
[29:00] me011 | Air conditioning .
"[29:06] fe008 | "" Where did you live ? "" I mean . What you said ."
"[29:08] fe008 | you know ,"
"[29:08] fe008 | "" where where wh where did you live ? "" , or"
"[29:10] fe008 | uh , what you were saying , "" Languages in the home "" ."
[29:11] fe008 | But I think that
[29:12] fe008 | uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of
[29:16] fe008 | It 's a little bit unbounded .
[29:19] me013 | so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood
"[29:25] fe008 | of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns , whatever they are ."
"[29:29] me013 | Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve , right ? So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you 're talking more about their"
"[29:43] me013 | linguistic speech patterns , you know"
"[29:45] fe008 | Oh , that 's interesting ."
"[29:47] me013 | But , again ,"
"[29:48] me013 | it depends how fine we wanna get , but we could say uh"
"[29:51] me013 | "" where did you live before you were five ? "" , "" where did you live after you were five ? "" , I don't know ."
[29:55] fe008 | Oh that 's interesting .
"[29:57] fe008 | fifteen or something ,"
[29:58] me013 | yeah
"[29:59] fe016 | I mean , I think the question on regions is really"
[30:02] fe016 | to ask people
"[30:04] fe016 | how did they define their dialect region now , di the whether they picked it up"
[30:08] fe016 | at the one age or another .
"[30:11] fe016 | pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern"
[30:14] fe016 | accent or not .
[30:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:16] fe016 | um , but they may have lived"
[30:25] me011 | Right .
[30:25] fe016 | Right ?
[30:25] fe016 | You ask how would you best define your
[30:25] me013 | Right .
[30:28] fe016 | your accent or your dialect style .
"[30:29] me011 | Right , the way the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking cuz it says "" Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region "" ."
[30:33] fe016 | OK
[30:37] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[30:41] me011 | whatever the TIMIT categories are . So I think
"[30:44] fe016 | Or you could say to somebody , how do you define your your the accent"
[30:44] me011 | i if you look at this fr
[30:47] fe016 | that you have .
[30:48] me011 | Right .
[30:48] fe016 | um
"[30:49] fe016 | And then you can ask these other questions as well , but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place"
"[30:55] fe016 | and that therefore they 're I mean , nowadays hardly anybody"
[30:57] me013 | Right .
"[30:58] fe016 | from California has a native Californian accent , so ."
[31:00] fe008 | Well I I g
"[31:02] fe008 | I don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now , because"
"[31:06] me011 | Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form ,"
"[31:09] fe016 | OK , as long as it 's clear ."
[31:10] fe008 | It 's a sub - categorization .
[31:10] me011 | i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language
[31:13] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[31:15] fe016 | OK .
[31:15] fe008 | Yeah .
[31:17] fe016 | OK .
[31:17] me011 | on the form .
[31:19] me013 | OK .
[31:19] me011 | So it 's just in the section talking about language .
[31:21] fe016 | OK .
[31:21] me013 | Why don't we try it out .
[31:22] me013 | and see see what kind of responses we get from people . Anyway .
[31:23] me011 | Yeah .
"[31:23] fe016 | Yeah ,"
"[31:25] me011 | And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is "" List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . "" And that 's just and open - ended"
[31:31] fe016 | Oh . Mm - hmm .
[31:32] me011 | place for them to do .
[31:34] fe016 | Sounds good .
[31:36] fe008 | or two . Yeah .
"[31:39] me011 | not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out ,"
[31:41] me011 | for um
"[31:43] me011 | the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in ,"
[31:46] me011 | since we 'll eventually anonymize and this will be a form a place for us to
"[31:50] me011 | connect the two . And then the meetings that they attended ,"
[31:51] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[31:53] me011 | because there 'll be one form for each person .
[31:56] fe016 | Sounds good .
[31:57] fe008 | It 's very efficient .
[31:59] me011 | OK . So .
"[32:01] me011 | Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff ."
[32:06] me018 | I don't think you really have to do all that much .
[32:07] me013 | d I yeah .
[32:08] fe016 | It it gets into a can of worms .
[32:09] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:10] fe016 | I mean , the more you ask , the more you realize that"
[32:10] me018 | Yeah .
[32:14] me018 | N Right .
[32:15] me018 | Yeah .
"[32:16] fe008 | Well , y you didn't really talk about the non - English speaker categories ."
[32:16] fe016 | So .
[32:19] me011 | Right .
"[32:19] me011 | So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language ,"
"[32:24] me011 | Region , and Variety of English ."
[32:26] me011 | And that 's it .
[32:28] me018 | N detec
[32:33] fe016 | What about proficiency in English ? as well ?
[32:33] fe008 | who 've
[32:34] fe008 | @ @
[32:35] fe008 | to tend toward American English .
[32:36] me011 | Proficiency . That 's a good idea .
"[32:37] me013 | Uh ,"
"[32:41] fe016 | You don't want to do it for political reasons , I mean I 'm no"
[32:41] mn005 | Hmm .
"[32:43] fe016 | I wasn't thinking about that , I was just thinking , "" Gee , I 'd"
"[32:45] fe016 | like to know actually """
[32:45] me013 | oh
"[32:46] me013 | No , no . I wasn't thinking political at all . I was just saying , looking at"
"[32:48] fe016 | Oh , OK ."
[32:54] me013 | generally not very good at assessing their own abilities .
[32:58] fe016 | OK .
[32:59] fe008 | I agree .
[32:59] me011 | That 's also because they know that
[33:01] me011 | it 's a re
[33:02] me013 | That could be .
[33:04] me011 | don't you think they overrate
[33:05] me011 | rather than underrate ?
[33:05] me013 | That could be .
[33:06] me013 | Yes .
"[33:07] me011 | So , but no , I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form ."
"[33:10] fe016 | Maybe we maybe we shouldn't ask it , I don't know ."
[33:12] me011 | what are what would the categories be ?
"[33:14] fe008 | I 'd I 'd have to I I 'd wanna relate it back to training . "" How many years did you study English "" , or ,"
"[33:19] fe008 | you know , "" have you lived in the America in a c an English"
"[33:26] fe008 | I mean , I think that"
"[33:28] fe016 | What about something like "" How comfortable are you"
[33:36] me013 | How b
"[33:37] me013 | How About "" How long have you been"
"[33:41] me013 | in an English speaking country ? """
"[33:43] fe016 | Yeah , that 's a good one ."
[33:43] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:43] fe008 | That 'd be OK .
[33:44] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:47] mn005 | Is better .
[33:48] mn005 | I think it 's better .
[33:48] fe016 | How yeah ? How long have you been in an English speaking country . OK .
[33:49] mn005 | @ @
[33:51] mn005 | Yeah .
"[33:52] fe008 | Yeah , I like that ."
[33:54] fe008 | I like that .
"[33:56] fe008 | That 's that 's non - threatening ,"
[33:57] fe008 | and it 's also an i
[33:58] me013 | Yeah
"[33:58] fe008 | a good indicator . And there are people who haven't ever lived in an English speaking country and who are superb . However ,"
"[34:04] fe008 | um ,"
[34:04] mn005 | Mmm .
[34:05] fe008 | you know
"[34:06] me018 | And then there will be people who live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language ."
[34:06] fe008 | I do think it 's a pretty good indicator .
[34:10] fe008 | That 's true too .
"[34:11] fe008 | Or even ,"
"[34:11] me018 | So ,"
[34:11] mn005 | Yeah .
"[34:11] fe008 | you know , I mean ,"
"[34:12] me011 | Yeah , I 'm I don't know ."
[34:13] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:13] me018 | Yochai 's company is like that .
"[34:14] me011 | Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask ,"
[34:15] me018 | Everybody speaks Hebrew .
[34:16] me013 | Really ?
[34:20] me011 | the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking .
"[34:24] me011 | Right ? It seems to be that asking about the proficiency , even if it 's self - rated ,"
[34:27] me011 | is what we wanna know .
"[34:28] fe008 | Except that you have some many biasing factors , you have you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident , and then you have ,"
[34:31] me013 | Yeah .
[34:39] me013 | Yes .
[34:41] fe008 | And also we wanna keep it simple and non - evaluative .
[34:44] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[34:45] me011 | OK .
[34:48] me013 | We done ?
"[34:50] me013 | Yeah . Oh , there 's another form ."
"[34:53] me013 | No , you got what 's the other form ?"
"[34:54] me011 | Uh , the other form is a modified digits form ."
[34:57] me011 | uh
"[34:58] me011 | and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple , it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language ."
"[35:07] me011 | Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session ,"
"[35:11] me011 | Mike number , Channel , Mike type ."
"[35:12] fe008 | Why do we need that much information , why do we need the email address , for example ?"
"[35:15] me011 | Uh , in case people have the same name ."
"[35:18] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[35:19] fe008 | How often would that happen ?
[35:19] me013 | In case people what ?
[35:20] me011 | Have the same name .
[35:23] me013 | Oh .
[35:30] me011 | at Boeing .
[35:31] fe008 | I see .
[35:38] fe008 | I now that I realize the und the reason for it .
"[35:41] me013 | Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time , someone 's email could change ."
[35:45] me011 | Right .
[35:46] fe008 | That 's true too .
"[35:47] me011 | Well , the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an ID"
[35:47] fe008 | Yeah .
"[35:50] me011 | but I hate it when people do that to me , when they say , here 's you ID , don't forget it ."
"[35:54] me013 | Oh yeah , that 's bad . Thanks"
[35:58] me011 | who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate .
[36:01] fe008 | That 's interesting .
[36:02] fe016 | How about their birthday ? I don't know .
[36:03] fe008 | Good idea .
"[36:04] fe016 | I mean , not not the year not the year not the year but just their birthday ."
"[36:06] me013 | Oh , I see . Then , you don't hafta ask the age ."
[36:09] mn005 | Not the year .
"[36:10] fe016 | I don't know , what are the chances of people having the same name ."
"[36:11] me011 | social security number ,"
"[36:12] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right . And a bank where you frequent ."
[36:16] me013 | Social social security number .
"[36:17] me011 | So , although the email email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it . We 'll be able to backtrack from email ."
[36:21] fe008 | I like that .
[36:22] fe008 | I never thought of that as an identifier .
[36:24] fe008 | That makes sense .
"[36:25] me011 | Um , and then the other thing I was thinking about"
"[36:27] me011 | and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form , but it it is something that"
[36:31] me011 | some form about the individual meeting .
[36:35] fe008 | Yeah .
"[36:35] me011 | Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out ."
"[36:39] fe008 | Well , that I think , someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact ."
"[36:47] fe008 | what you would put in the DTD that 's meeting - specific . So . And it could be something like ,"
"[36:50] fe008 | "" oh by the way ,"
[36:51] fe008 | the guy giving the presentation today
[36:54] fe008 | is the student of the professor who
"[36:56] fe008 | you know , whatever "" ."
"[36:57] fe008 | So , speaker A is his professor and they and he 's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that ."
"[37:03] fe008 | Or it could be you know , "" so - and - so and so - and - so are married "" ."
[37:03] mn005 | Hmm .
[37:06] me011 | Just to pick up an arbitrary an example .
"[37:09] fe008 | We this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know , if there 's a big discussion on"
"[37:17] fe008 | then and these people are talking a whole lot ,"
"[37:24] fe008 | I I don't mean , uh , you know ."
[37:24] me011 | Right .
[37:25] me011 | So th so the sorts of questions I had were one
"[37:28] me011 | Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out"
[37:35] fe008 | I would tend to leave that
"[37:36] fe008 | e spontaneous , I think that"
[37:37] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[37:37] fe008 | e at the stage of uh
"[37:39] fe008 | Uh , sc scanning the"
[37:45] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:46] fe008 | At that point , I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important , and you could you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have ."
[37:55] fe008 | Yeah .
"[37:57] me011 | what sort of information do we want to record ? I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy ."
[38:01] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:02] me011 | You know , source , destination , relation ."
[38:04] me011 | Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ?
"[38:09] fe008 | Well , I ju I was just thinking , with reference to"
"[38:11] fe008 | uh , things that have that bear on the content or the status relations ,"
"[38:16] fe008 | Without being exhaustive , by any means ,"
"[38:26] fe008 | So , I mean , a person"
"[38:27] fe008 | is asked a whole bunch of questions , more than you 'd usually think they 'd be asked , and it turns out it 's because he 's being prepared for a job interview or something like that ,"
[38:33] me011 | Right .
[38:34] fe008 | then it 's useful to know that that relationship .
"[38:37] fe008 | But , not to be exhaustive ."
[38:42] fe008 | Interesting .
"[38:43] me011 | looking at it . So ,"
[38:46] me011 | are there anything other than pairwise ?
"[38:52] me011 | Oh yeah , OK ."
[38:52] fe008 | uh
[38:53] fe016 | So thi
"[38:54] fe016 | Isn't this an open - ended ,"
[38:55] fe016 | like
[38:56] fe016 | basically a notes column ? I mean you can imagine wanting
[39:00] fe016 | you should be able always to attach some
"[39:02] me011 | Yes , shirt certainly ."
"[39:02] fe016 | notes to is this the the place where we would do that , or is there another"
[39:07] fe016 | place .
[39:09] me011 | We could attach more structure if we wanted to . Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships .
"[39:16] me013 | I Maybe I was missing something maybe , but"
"[39:19] me013 | this is something one would try to infer , but how do how would you"
"[39:23] me013 | How would you freeze that information about what , uh , I mean , we already have these things about someone 's a professor and someone 's a student , or something , but"
[39:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:39] me013 | What what what uh ,"
"[39:39] me011 | Um , just as an example , it would be , "" Source , Adam Janin "" , "" Destination , Morgan "" , "" Relationship , Advisor "" ."
"[39:47] me013 | Oh , so you 're just putting"
[39:48] me013 | preexisting
[39:50] me013 | relationships that are
[39:52] me013 | I see .
"[39:54] fe016 | There 's definitely some clear cases ,"
[39:58] me011 | Yep .
[39:59] fe016 | the context
[40:01] fe016 | happens
"[40:02] fe016 | just in that meeting , or , I mean , where you don't wanna sort of"
"[40:04] me013 | Yeah , I m"
[40:07] fe016 | have to
[40:08] fe016 | make a distinction between a pre - existing
"[40:11] fe016 | relationship , or"
[40:13] fe008 | the idea was that this would be meeting specific .
[40:17] fe008 | it would be possible to have a
"[40:18] fe016 | But I mean , there are some that generalize"
[40:18] fe008 | higher level thing .
"[40:20] fe016 | over many meetings and there are some that don't , and there are some"
[40:22] fe008 | That 's true .
"[40:22] me011 | Right , so my example was not a good one ,"
[40:23] fe008 | That 's true .
"[40:23] fe016 | things that happen in between meetings ,"
[40:24] me013 | Yeah .
"[40:27] me013 | today , for instance , this is the second meeting recorded today ."
"[40:29] me013 | The first meeting was a was a front - end meeting , and in that one , the basic form of that was uh , I was the leader ,"
"[40:35] me013 | and I was saying uh , "" what are the results you 've gotten in the last week ? """
"[40:39] me013 | And they were and uh one person was sort of taking the lead ,"
"[40:43] me013 | in describing what the results were ,"
"[40:46] me013 | and then uh , Chuck was taking the role of saying , "" well , what did you mean by that ? "" , so he was sort of like the out s semi - outsider , asking curiosity questions ."
"[40:54] me013 | And then it would come back to me with saying "" well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , """
[41:00] me013 | so it was very much sort of
"[41:01] me013 | "" Leader "" and and and and "" Led "" sort of relationship ."
"[41:06] me013 | the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher ,"
"[41:11] me013 | uh , in this l meeting ,"
"[41:13] me013 | uh , you are my graduate student ,"
"[41:14] me013 | but uh it 's not taking that kind of role at all ,"
[41:17] me011 | Right .
"[41:27] fe016 | I think this one needs to be open - ended , completely open - ended , and"
[41:32] fe016 | the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field .
[41:39] fe008 | @ @
[41:40] fe008 | I mean .
"[41:41] fe008 | You 're the expert on the D T Ds ,"
"[41:43] me011 | Well , the D T Ds mean we can"
[41:45] fe008 | Yeah .
[41:45] me011 | however we want it .
[41:48] me011 | the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common .
"[41:53] me011 | Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise . And you might want a tool"
[41:58] me011 | that used that information .
[42:00] fe016 | Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub
"[42:04] fe016 | I don't know what you would call them , but little labels"
[42:06] fe016 | for things that we decide are useful things to have
"[42:09] me011 | Sure , absolutely ."
[42:09] fe016 | but
"[42:10] fe016 | You know , as long as we have this one"
"[42:13] fe016 | place where it can all be stored , then we 're fine , I think ."
[42:20] me011 | Right .
[42:21] fe016 | some totally different
"[42:22] me013 | Exactly . It 's sort of a research question , you you 're analyzing the meeting and you 're deciding , "" ah , there 's this kind of structure to it . """
[42:23] fe016 | keyword .
[42:27] me013 | Yeah .
[42:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[42:28] mn005 | Interesting .
[42:36] me011 | So you 're football league was a good one .
[42:38] me011 | So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of
"[42:40] me011 | uh , power , responsibility ."
[42:42] me011 | I guess husband - wife is yet another one .
[42:47] fe008 | analysis you get things like
[42:49] me011 | Ach !
[42:49] fe008 | @ @
[42:50] fe008 | the role .
[42:51] me011 | Hmm .
"[42:52] mn005 | Role , yeah ."
[42:55] mn005 | Yeah .
"[42:56] fe008 | You know , and so there are various things you negotiate ."
"[42:59] fe008 | And I 'm I 'm wondering if we might be able to do it s in sort of a loose way , but"
"[43:03] fe008 | e with by having a searchable field like "" role """
"[43:07] fe008 | and then you know "" within this context this person has the following roles "" ,"
[43:10] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:10] fe008 | and it could be very loose , but then it would be possible to"
[43:11] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:13] fe008 | do something as simple as a grep across a database and if you 're interested in
[43:17] fe008 | you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus
[43:21] fe008 | you know a l uh s uh
"[43:23] fe008 | whatever , a leader , speaker , whatever ,"
[43:25] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[43:27] fe008 | and and
"[43:28] fe008 | you know , some some particular value ."
"[43:30] me013 | So it sounds like having the facility is great , and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be"
[43:30] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[43:38] me013 | generally useful and it it sounds like a good thing to do .
[43:41] me011 | OK .
[43:41] fe008 | Interesting . Good .
[43:42] fe008 | And systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful .
[43:44] me011 | Nope .
"[43:47] me011 | Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise , so that 's probably not sufficient ."
[43:47] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:50] fe008 | I think you don't need to have that much structure built in , and that would"
"[43:52] me011 | Yeah , maybe not ."
"[43:52] fe008 | be less time - consuming to do it this way first , and then find out what structure 's needed ."
[43:54] me011 | Yep .
[43:56] me018 | what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this ?
[43:56] me011 | OK .
"[44:02] me011 | Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway ."
"[44:07] me011 | So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it ."
[44:11] me018 | Mmm .
[44:12] me013 | Almost all of the meetings
[44:15] me013 | that we have
[44:19] me011 | Right .
"[44:22] me013 | a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning , so this is not a lot of people . We could easily There 's just a couple other meetings that"
[44:26] me011 | Right .
[44:30] me011 | We can regenerate a lot of this information .
[44:32] me018 | Yeah .
[44:32] me013 | Yeah .
"[44:33] me011 | Even if we can't ,"
"[44:35] me011 | generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your"
"[44:39] me011 | database blank ,"
[44:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[44:40] me011 | that this information was not collected for this meeting .
[44:43] me011 | And there 's just not gonna be a way around that .
[44:45] me011 | That 's just gonna happen
"[44:48] me011 | like the N S A meeting ,"
[44:50] me011 | the
[44:50] me011 | networks meeting .
[44:51] me011 | I don't think they 're gonna want to fill out that information .
[44:53] me018 | Yeah .
[44:55] me011 | So .
"[44:57] me011 | OK , enough on forms ."
"[44:59] me013 | OK , so we 're running kind of late , so we 'll probably wanna zip through some other things , maybe"
"[45:03] me013 | do some more time on on Jose 's stuff later , um uh Status of Transcription ,"
"[45:09] me013 | Uh , I guess , you know , we we recently woke up um our friends and uh"
[45:17] me013 | so I I guess you 've sent off this the uh
"[45:26] me011 | They haven't received them yet ,"
[45:27] me011 | but I did get a response from them saying
"[45:30] me011 | "" Yes we 're still alive , we haven't done anything yet . "" basically ."
[45:33] me013 | Yeah .
"[45:36] me011 | Yeah . So so , they 've"
[45:37] me013 | Yeah .
[45:39] me011 | transferred the responsibility to someone else . I can't remember his name
[45:42] me013 | McCoond
[45:42] me011 | McCoond ?
[45:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[45:46] me011 | And so he sent me email and said he 's gonna be starting to work on it , and I haven't received anything else ."
"[45:50] me013 | Great , OK . Well , that was that one ."
[45:50] me011 | So .
[45:51] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:53] me013 | Um ,"
"[45:53] me011 | So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it , he should be getting it today ."
[45:58] me011 | Actually he should have gotten it yesterday . But .
[46:01] me011 | Give him a day .
"[46:03] me013 | um , and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you , off - line Jose cuz it 's getting kind of late but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there 's there 's a lot of overlap ,"
[46:07] mn005 | Yeah .
[46:12] me013 | in just energy related things and so you need something else .
[46:14] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:16] me013 | I mean , that 's sort of right ?"
[46:22] me013 | The residual error ?
[46:30] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:31] mn005 | Ah , yeah yeah . I I found the error ,"
"[46:34] mn005 | and I repeated the experiments eh and here , eh you can find the new results"
[46:40] me018 | Ah .
"[46:40] me013 | OK , so this is post bug fix . Good , OK ."
[46:42] mn005 | OK ?
"[46:43] me013 | So um so I had two thought just glancing through this . So , one is one is that um"
[46:51] me013 | we might wanna talk about normalization .
"[46:53] me013 | I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use . Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done"
[46:59] me013 | some kind of normalization and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible .
[47:04] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:05] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:11] me013 | I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different and um so"
[47:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:27] me013 | um
[47:29] me011 | Hmm .
"[47:31] me013 | relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ?"
[47:37] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:37] me013 | You know , so if if there 's uh a really bad fit between"
"[47:42] me013 | where the pitch is going in this suppose uh hypothesized region of overlap ,"
"[47:47] me013 | and the the and one or the other uh side ,"
[47:51] mn005 | Another side .
"[47:51] me013 | you know , then this this this might"
[47:53] mn005 | an alteration in th in the tracking way .
[48:00] mn005 | I understand that eh you you mean eh to to study the alteration
[48:05] mn005 | between the the tracking of the pitch eh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone .
[48:13] mn005 | in the co in the context .
[48:17] me013 | two
[48:18] me013 | people speaking
[48:19] mn005 | Yeah .
[48:20] me013 | uh and
"[48:23] me013 | there 's an overlap , then I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics"
[48:27] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[48:31] me013 | And um
"[48:33] me013 | the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence ,"
"[48:40] me013 | it 's also going to be a smaller fraction . This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing ."
[48:42] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[48:48] mn005 | Yeah .
[48:49] me013 | there should be something like a discontinuity there .
[48:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[48:56] me013 | but maybe it 'll have something to have a different character .
"[49:04] me013 | if unless this is a normalization problem , it looks from your results like there 's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy - like , in addition to it , at least ."
[49:07] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[49:09] mn005 | OK .
[49:14] mn005 | I don't normalicized eh in these er experiments .
[49:17] mn005 | by the moment . I don't normalicize .
"[49:19] me013 | OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help ."
[49:20] mn005 | Yeah ?
"[49:24] me013 | You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall"
"[49:31] me013 | um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something , uh that that there would be more of a distinction ."
[49:31] mn005 | Nnn . Yeah .
[49:34] mn005 | The different zone .
"[49:41] me013 | uh , I I don't know ."
"[49:44] me018 | from these charts ,"
"[49:46] me018 | are hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were , but uh , were you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between overlap and single speakers by looking at the e energy , like say , for example , the mean of the energy . Was that the idea ? OK ."
[49:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[49:58] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:00] mn005 | Yeah .
"[50:02] me018 | on this page that has uh frame energy , you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two , so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which"
[50:08] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:10] mn005 | Yeah .
"[50:12] me013 | Which is the intuition , un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten , so"
[50:13] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:14] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:16] mn005 | Yeah .
"[50:17] me018 | Yeah , different than standard deviation ."
[50:17] fe008 | Oh .
[50:17] mn005 | The product of the deviation is the vari is the variance .
[50:19] me018 | Yeah .
[50:19] fe016 | But are we assuming
[50:21] fe016 | that you could
[50:24] fe016 | know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ? I mean
"[50:28] fe016 | I can imagine a model where you say , OK , you know"
"[50:31] fe016 | I 'm I 'm gonna give myself it 's cheating , but"
[50:35] fe016 | not completely if they 're
[50:37] fe016 | often not overlapping
[50:39] fe016 | and normalized for the speaker
[50:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:41] fe016 | or is that
[50:43] mn005 | Yeah .
[50:45] mn005 | Yeah .
"[50:47] me013 | even if you make a mistake occasionally , that that i is roughly"
[50:52] fe016 | right
[50:52] me013 | i is there some
"[50:53] me013 | corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if if uh if you"
[50:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[51:00] me013 | because that that 's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot , to not do any kind of normalization , and so that that could mask the effect somewhat ."
[51:04] fe016 | right
"[51:08] me018 | so the um just one more clarifying question On the overlap category , is that"
[51:13] me018 | overlapping of speakers
[51:15] me018 | only ?
[51:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:16] me018 | It doesn't include some of the other sounds ? OK .
[51:18] mn005 | No .
"[51:19] mn005 | It 's a pu pure overlapping zone . I mean that eh overlapping between two , three , four eh eh speaker ."
[51:21] me018 | OK .
[51:25] me018 | OK .
[51:25] me011 | And did is this from the mixed signal ?
[51:26] mn005 | Th -
[51:28] mn005 | Yeah .
"[51:28] me011 | OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized"
"[51:31] fe016 | Right ,"
[51:32] fe016 | right .
[51:33] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:33] me011 | uh over the entire signal .
[51:33] fe016 | Right .
"[51:37] fe016 | That 's what makes it seem difficult , because you 're already left with"
[51:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:41] fe016 | a high standard deviation and they 're already roughly
[51:43] mn005 | Yeah .
"[51:46] fe016 | so that each person 's hearable , right ? so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway ."
[51:48] me011 | Right .
[51:49] me011 | Right .
[51:54] fe008 | What about doing it with just the single channels ?
[51:57] mn005 | Sorry ?
"[51:57] fe008 | What about ,"
[51:58] fe008 | uh
[51:59] mn005 | Say
[51:59] mn005 | this graphic ?
"[52:01] fe008 | Well , I I 'm thinking so"
[52:02] fe008 | they 're raising the question about the fact
[52:04] fe008 | that
"[52:04] fe008 | if you use the mixed signal ,"
[52:06] mn005 | Yeah . I use the mixed signal
"[52:11] me011 | Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it ."
[52:11] fe008 | I I 'm wo
[52:13] fe008 | Exactly . So what I 'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the
[52:14] mn005 | but
[52:16] fe008 | single channel
[52:18] fe008 | recordings .
[52:18] mn005 | Ah .
[52:19] mn005 | I I don't study the single channel
[52:21] mn005 | yet
[52:22] mn005 | but eh
[52:23] mn005 | is eh is an idea .
[52:25] mn005 | to to begin to work with the
[52:31] me013 | I have another another thought .
[52:36] me013 | frames have a lot of
[52:37] me013 | variance to them because different sounds
[52:39] me013 | are different
[52:40] me013 | loudnesses .
[52:41] me013 | So
[52:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:42] me013 | I mean , what if you took uh one second"
[52:44] me013 | chunks or something like that . Or or
"[52:51] fe016 | Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds or twenty to twenty - five frames , or"
[52:52] me013 | Yeah .
[52:53] me013 | Right .
[52:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:56] me013 | Something , yeah ."
[52:56] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:57] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:02] me013 | and then you looked at the amount of energy in that .
[53:04] me013 | and how does that vary over these different cases .
[53:07] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[53:08] fe016 | or voiced regions , I mean"
[53:11] fe016 | can we tell ? can we sorry
[53:11] fe008 | Interesting .
"[53:12] fe016 | I mean , is it known whether something 's voiced here , or is it roughly estimate estimateable ?"
[53:19] me013 | you could first determine that something was voiced or not .
"[53:20] fe016 | I mean like if one speaker 's voicing and the other one isn't and they 're overlapping ,"
"[53:25] fe016 | do we know that the first speaker 's voicing , or not ?"
"[53:29] me013 | Well , I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time and so uh there could be voiced and non - voiced pieces during the overlap ."
[53:30] mn005 | Ah .
[53:34] me011 | Huh .
[53:37] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[53:38] fe016 | But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ?
[53:42] fe016 | That 's what I just wondered .
"[53:43] me013 | I don't know ,"
"[53:45] fe016 | So if we could , or if you could do some of it ,"
"[53:46] me013 | this this has to do with these questions of harmonicity , and so forth , right ?"
[53:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:48] mn005 | Yeah .
"[53:48] fe016 | yeah ,"
[53:49] mn005 | Yeah .
"[53:49] fe016 | then um , voiced regions would be , like , probably more informative ,"
[53:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[53:55] me013 | Right , so you could do something like , uh"
[53:59] me013 | Sure .
[54:09] me013 | a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it .
[54:09] me011 | Right .
[54:13] me011 | And he has on his graph something like forty percent .
[54:15] me011 | It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer
[54:18] me011 | overlap
[54:20] me011 | It 's li I think the last page .
[54:22] mn005 | Yeah .
[54:22] me013 | Is it ?
[54:23] fe008 | That 'll also lessen the standard deviation .
[54:27] mn005 | a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone .
"[54:29] me011 | Nope , not the last page ."
[54:32] mn005 | Um .
[54:32] me011 | Where was it ?
[54:33] me011 | It was one of the tables .
[54:35] me013 | What ?
[54:35] mn005 | How define ?
"[54:36] me013 | Are you using a pitch detector in this yet , in your"
[54:39] me013 | experiments ?
[54:39] mn005 | I
[54:40] me013 | Do you have a pitch detector that you 're
[54:41] me013 | using ?
[54:42] mn005 | Eh j my ?
[54:44] me013 | do you have a a pitch detector
[54:44] fe008 | Pitch .
[54:45] me013 | that you are using
"[54:46] mn005 | eh , I I 'm working now with pitch detector ."
[54:47] me013 | in these experiments ?
"[54:47] fe016 | Well , it 's the fifth page , I guess ."
[54:49] me013 | Yeah .
"[54:50] mn005 | I 'm working now , but eh I haven't eh results yet . But eh at this moment I I I prepare , I am I am preparing the the pitch eh eh tracking ."
[54:50] me011 | Fifth page .
"[54:53] me011 | Oh , it 's seventy - five percent !"
[55:02] mn005 | pitch tracker eh algorithm that I have but eh
"[55:05] me013 | does it have a voiced , unvoiced uh"
"[55:07] me013 | detector in it , uh ?"
[55:08] mn005 | No .
[55:10] me013 | It doesn't .
[55:11] me013 | it just finds the pi it just finds the pitch even when it 's unvoiced ?
[55:15] fe016 | It has to tell you .
"[55:16] me013 | It has to tell you something , right ?"
[55:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[55:19] me013 | Yeah .
[55:21] mn005 | It 's based on uh a correlation
[55:25] mn005 | between frame the utterance
[55:25] me013 | Yeah .
[55:27] me013 | Right .
[55:30] mn005 | because it 's no my my algorithm .
[55:36] me013 | it 's voiced with a pitch of such - and - such .
[55:38] me013 | And it will i i
[55:39] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[55:45] me013 | good uh uh period , right ? So it 's looking for some periodic behavior , and if it can't find a period it tells you"
[55:45] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[55:51] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[55:51] me013 | for for most things like that .
[55:52] mn005 | For most @ @ .
"[55:53] me013 | So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting which I think actually is good ,"
"[55:57] me013 | the more I think of it , that that um"
[56:03] me013 | voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that .
"[56:06] me013 | I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it"
[56:13] me013 | it 's it it may not be normalized enough .
[56:15] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[56:16] mn005 | For b for both , for eh the frame energy and eh residular LPC eh energy"
[56:23] mn005 | too .
"[56:23] me013 | Uh , for both , yeah ."
[56:24] mn005 | For both .
[56:24] me013 | Yeah .
[56:26] me013 | Yeah .
[56:26] mn005 | but eh
[56:30] mn005 | I eh
"[56:34] me013 | OK , so so I think"
"[56:36] me013 | I mean , @ @ this is something to to experimentally determine , but I mean ,"
[56:39] mn005 | Yeah .
[56:40] me013 | if um
[56:40] mn005 | Yeah .
"[56:42] me013 | u as I understand it , you have you have some"
[56:45] me013 | regions that uh
[56:47] me013 | um
"[56:49] me013 | are marked , as You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold , right ? and so"
[56:53] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[56:54] me013 | um
[56:56] me013 | um if you take
[56:58] me013 | um
[57:02] me013 | all the things all the uh
"[57:04] me013 | speak things marked "" SPK "" ,"
[57:08] me013 | and uh look for the voiced
"[57:11] me013 | uh energy in them ,"
[57:13] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[57:13] me013 | and uh
"[57:15] me013 | well , just in in each case , take a take a take a frame ,"
"[57:20] me013 | if it 's if it 's voiced ,"
"[57:23] me013 | Just separate out from the from the normal things , separate out voiced ."
"[57:23] fe016 | Mm - hmm , mm - hmm ."
[57:26] mn005 | Yeah .
"[57:28] me013 | with uh a a uh a mean uh standard devia deviation , and so forth . And then do your normalization based on that ."
[57:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:36] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:37] me013 | And once you do that
"[57:38] me013 | just for voiced , um"
[57:41] me013 | um
[57:44] fe016 | You can also look at just the voiced regions
"[57:46] fe016 | later . I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure ."
[57:51] fe016 | because
"[57:53] fe016 | you know , if you 're normalizing for voiced , and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is , um ,"
[58:06] mn005 | Yeah .
[58:09] me013 | Yeah .
[58:11] fe016 | at fricatives or something you won't really know anything .
[58:15] fe016 | So
[58:15] fe016 | I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of
[58:16] me013 | Right .
[58:19] fe016 | long enough
[58:22] me013 | Right .
[58:25] me013 | Right .
[58:26] mn005 | Hmm .
"[58:30] fe016 | You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing"
[58:33] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[58:36] fe016 | and if you can capture it when there 's overlap
[58:39] fe016 | then you should do quite well
[58:41] mn005 | Mmm .
[58:42] fe016 | there .
[58:44] fe008 | I 'm wondering about
"[58:48] fe008 | that one data sample , right , that one meeting ?"
[58:50] mn005 | Yeah .
[58:51] fe008 | But
[58:51] fe008 | it seems like
[58:53] fe008 | it it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined
[58:59] fe008 | rather than
"[59:00] fe008 | taking s you know , maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix and seeing if"
"[59:07] fe008 | that type of analysis . If you take like a target speaker , and maybe"
[59:07] me013 | w
[59:08] me013 | Yeah .
[59:13] fe008 | two target speakers and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers .
"[59:17] me013 | You could do that , yeah ."
[59:20] fe008 | That 's hard .
"[59:21] me013 | But but I I think that this is a good first thing ,"
[59:24] me013 | to just sort of see .
[59:25] me013 | And and what this says is that th that
"[59:27] me013 | without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here ."
[59:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[59:31] fe008 | OK .
[59:33] me013 | I mean
"[59:39] me013 | What do you look at in order to normalize ? I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is ,"
[59:46] me013 | W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it
[59:50] me013 | by ?
[59:50] mn005 | Yeah .
"[59:50] me013 | And and uh ,"
[59:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[59:57] fe016 | I think
[59:58] fe016 | also the
[59:59] fe016 | harmonics would be very important .
"[00:01] fe016 | So if you can find voiced regions and You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing"
[00:02] me013 | Yes .
"[00:06] fe016 | unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly"
"[00:11] me013 | Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure . Yeah . So ."
"[00:12] fe016 | just by counting them , I mean yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some non - voiced regions , at least you can have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure ."
[00:13] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:24] me011 | It seems like with
[00:25] mn005 | Yeah .
"[00:26] me011 | the overlaps being fairly long ,"
[00:28] me011 | that should make it easier .
[00:29] mn005 | Yeah .
"[00:29] fe016 | Right ,"
[00:29] me011 | That r that was an interesting statistic .
[00:30] mn005 | Yeah .
"[00:30] fe016 | and you could put an estimate estimate , you know , a fuzzy start and end"
[00:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:32] me011 | That they 're much longer than I expected .
[00:33] mn005 | But this is very short .
[00:34] fe016 | time .
[00:34] me011 | Ninety percent of them are over
[00:36] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:36] me011 | two m two hundred milliseconds .
[00:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[00:39] me013 | Yeah .
[00:40] mn005 | Is a problem to detect .
"[00:42] fe016 | Well , it 's sort of good , though , if you 're for for your accuracy . Uh , Gives you a little more time to try to detect them ."
[00:47] me011 | but it surprised me .
"[00:48] mn005 | It 's a problem to identify and to detect , too ,"
"[00:52] mn005 | with eh the Javier system , for example ."
[00:55] me011 | Yes .
[00:59] mn005 | It 's a problem .
[01:00] me013 | Yeah .
"[01:01] me013 | Uh , well ."
"[01:02] mn005 | Eh , what sorry ."
[01:02] me013 | Good .
[01:03] me013 | Yeah .
[01:04] mn005 | What what happened with the different contexts because eh eh you are talking about eh
[01:08] mn005 | the period or the the duration of the the window to eh the the long
[01:15] mn005 | of the window to to consider normalization no ?
[01:20] mn005 | But eh we have different contexts .
[01:24] mn005 | The the the the period the the the length of the window to to normalize eh the energy is eh in the context of the overlapping zone ?
"[01:35] mn005 | Is eh in the in the left context as in th in the right context , considering eh the these frames ?"
[01:42] mn005 | You mean ?
[01:43] me013 | I don't know .
[01:43] me013 | I I wanna think about it and you should think about it . I I I didn't want to just pop out an answer because I realized I I hadn't thought about it enough .
[01:45] mn005 | Yeah .
[01:48] mn005 | OK .
"[01:49] me011 | Two hundred milliseconds , hamming window ."
[01:49] mn005 | Because because the the the problem is that we have different contexts .
[01:54] fe016 | somethin something like that
[01:56] fe008 | That 's true .
[01:57] fe008 | That 's complicated .
[01:57] fe016 | too .
"[01:57] me018 | Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ?"
[01:58] me013 | I 'm not sure .
[01:59] mn005 | Yeah .
[02:00] me018 | What was the bug that you found ?
[02:02] mn005 | What the bu
[02:03] me018 | The bug from last uh meeting ?
"[02:04] mn005 | Ah , the bug ."
[02:05] mn005 | The bug of was the the F - seek function in C .
[02:11] mn005 | you try to to to ass n n to do an a dated access
"[02:17] mn005 | to to a file , a big file , eh eh moving the the head of the in the hard disk , eh e forward and backward"
[02:26] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[02:27] mn005 | a lot of time eh
[02:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[02:29] mn005 | in a moment
[02:33] me011 | Hmm .
[02:33] mn005 | and I had an problem .
"[02:33] fe008 | Ah , that 's interesting , and it didn't give you good error messages ."
[02:36] mn005 | it 's incredible .
[02:37] fe008 | Huh .
[02:37] me018 | Hmm !
[02:38] mn005 | I I I do the same in in another in another way and I haven't problem .
[02:38] me018 | So it was positioning randomly ?
[02:43] me011 | Did you
[02:44] me011 | typecast to long ?
[02:45] me011 | or
[02:46] me011 | size - T or whatever it is ? I don't remember what it is .
"[02:49] me011 | One of the problems , if the file is large ,"
"[02:52] me011 | um , and you 're cast to the wrong type ."
"[02:54] mn005 | I I don't know , but uh I I think the the position in the file"
[02:58] mn005 | eh
[02:59] mn005 | doesn't work
"[03:01] mn005 | eh eh in long file ,"
[03:04] mn005 | a very long file .
"[03:04] me013 | Well , what he 's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue ,"
"[03:07] me011 | Right , if you 're sending at an integer instead of a long ."
[03:07] me013 | for F - seek .
[03:10] mn005 | The typecast .
"[03:11] me011 | Typecast from integer , "" int """
[03:14] me011 | INT
[03:15] mn005 | Yeah .
[03:15] me011 | or long
[03:16] me011 | or unsigned long .
"[03:21] mn005 | No , no , it 's unsigned ."
[03:23] me011 | Yeah .
"[03:24] me011 | Well ,"
[03:25] me011 | It 's one possibility .
[03:26] mn005 | Signed .
"[03:27] me013 | Yeah , cuz I think in I mean , in general F - seek works , so it 's"
[03:28] mn005 | I I I don't know
[03:30] me011 | Yep .
[03:30] mn005 | I don't know but eh I I solved the problem with eh
"[03:32] me013 | Yeah ,"
[03:34] me013 | Yeah .
[03:34] mn005 | a similar way and I haven't problem
[03:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[03:37] mn005 | but eh I I I don't know because eh
[03:39] mn005 | eh it doesn't eh happen to me before .
[03:39] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:44] me013 | Anyway ,"
"[03:45] mn005 | I I I have the same codes in different parts ,"
"[03:48] mn005 | and uh I I had to to to change all all the points in the in the code ,"
"[03:55] mn005 | eh to substitute eh for another way , but"
[03:57] me011 | Yep .
[03:58] mn005 | eh is
"[03:59] me013 | Anyway , we 're we 're missing snacks here , so uh let 's let 's let 's let 's do our let 's do our digits and and uh"
[04:02] me011 | Shall we do digits ?
"[04:04] fe008 | Oh , digits ."
[04:06] fe008 | OK .
[08:06] me011 | OK . Are we done ?
"[08:08] me011 | Yes , OK ."
[08:08] me013 | Yep .
[08:09] mn005 | OK .
"[08:12] me011 | OK , we are going off ."

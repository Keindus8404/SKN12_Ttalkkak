[00:02] me018 | I think I 'm zero .
[00:04] fn002 | Ah -
[00:04] me006 | Wh - what causes the crash ?
[00:04] me013 | Unprecedented .
"[00:04] me034 | Hello , hello , hello , hello ."
[00:05] me018 | Did you fix something ?
[00:07] me034 | Hello .
"[00:09] fn002 | Five , five ."
"[00:09] me034 | Hello , hello ."
"[00:09] me006 | Oh , maybe it 's the turning turning off and turning on of the mike , right ?"
"[00:22] me013 | Uh , you think that 's you ?"
[00:24] me013 | Oh .
[00:25] me034 | Aaa - aaa - aaa . OK . That 's me .
[00:34] me013 | OK .
"[00:36] me013 | OK . So , um I guess we are"
"[00:44] mn007 | Channel channel three , yeah . OK ."
"[00:47] fn002 | Mmm , channel five ?"
[00:47] me034 | Channel two .
[00:49] fn002 | Doesn't work ?
[00:49] me034 | Two .
"[00:50] me013 | Yeah , that 's the mike number there ,"
[00:53] fn002 | No ?
"[00:54] me018 | Is it written on her sheet , I believe ."
"[00:57] me013 | Uh , mike number five ,"
"[00:58] fn002 | Ah , era el cuatro . Yeah ."
[01:00] me013 | channel channel four .
[01:01] fn002 | Yeah yeah yeah .
"[01:05] fn002 | Ah yeah , it 's OK ."
[01:06] me013 | Yeah .
[01:10] me034 | I think I 'm channel two .
"[01:11] me013 | Oh , I 'm channel must be channel one . Channel one ? Yes , OK ."
[01:16] me013 | OK . So uh
"[01:35] mn007 | Uh so . uh We So As I was already said , we we mainly focused on"
"[01:47] mn007 | uh four kind of features . The PLP , the PLP with JRASTA , the MSG , and the MFCC from the baseline Aurora ."
[02:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:02] mn007 | Uh , and we focused for the the test part on the English and the Italian ."
[02:09] mn007 | Um . We 've trained uh several neural networks on so on the TI - digits English and on the Italian data and also on the broad uh English uh French and uh Spanish databases .
"[02:30] mn007 | Mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well ."
[02:52] me011 | I can't get back far enough .
[02:53] me034 | Chicken on the grill .
[02:56] me034 | Try that corner .
[02:57] me018 | How about over th from the front of the room ?
"[02:58] me034 | Yeah , it 's longer ."
[03:00] me013 | We 're pausing for a photo opportunity here . Uh .
[03:03] me013 | Uh .
[03:06] me013 | So .
[03:06] me006 | Oh wait wait wait wait wait . Wait . Hold on . Hold on . Let me give you a black screen .
[03:07] me034 | Get out of the Yeah .
[03:09] me013 | OK .
[03:15] me011 | One more .
[03:17] me013 | He 's facing this way .
[03:18] me011 | Because we said we were gonna do this and I just remembered .
"[03:26] me013 | OK , this this would be a good section for our silence detection ."
[03:30] me034 | Mm - hmm .
[03:34] me013 | Oh .
[03:35] me013 | OK .
"[03:36] me013 | So um ,"
"[03:41] mn007 | Yeah , so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem works pretty well . And uh actually we have uh , results are similar"
[03:41] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:57] me018 | On data from just that task , that language ?"
[03:59] mn007 | Just that task .
[04:00] mn007 | But actually we didn't train network on uh both types of data I mean
[04:13] me018 | Mmm .
[04:19] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:22] mn007 | Yeah . So ,"
[04:24] me013 | clearly it 's gonna be good then but the question is how much worse is it
[04:24] me018 | So what 's th
"[04:29] me013 | I mean ,"
"[04:31] me013 | From what I saw from the earlier results , uh I guess last week ,"
[04:44] mn007 | Mmm . Yeah .
[04:45] me013 | But but the question is if you train on one language
[04:57] mn007 | If we use the same language ?
"[04:59] me013 | No , no , no ."
[05:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:08] me013 | I don't have the numbers in front of me , so I 'm just imagining ."
[05:11] me013 | E
"[05:13] me013 | So , you didn't train on TIMIT and test on on Italian digits , say ?"
"[05:17] mn007 | No , we did four four kind of of testing , actually ."
[05:29] mn007 | So for Italian on the Italian speech @ @ .
[05:34] mn007 | The second test is trained on a single language
"[05:39] mn007 | um with broad database , but the same language as the t task data ."
[05:44] me013 | OK .
[05:44] mn007 | But for Italian we choose Spanish which we assume is close to Italian .
"[05:49] mn007 | The third test is by using , um"
[05:53] mn007 | the three language database
[05:56] mn007 | and the fourth is
[05:56] me013 | W which in It has three languages . That 's including the w
[06:03] mn007 | But not
[06:03] me018 | In -
[06:05] me018 | The three languages
[06:08] mn007 | Yeah
[06:09] mn007 | And the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language .
"[06:18] me013 | Oh , OK , yeah , so , that is what I wanted to know ."
[06:19] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:20] me013 | I just wasn't saying it very well , I guess ."
"[06:21] mn007 | Uh , yeah ."
"[06:22] mn007 | So um for uh TI - digits for ins example uh when we go from TI - digits training to TIMIT training uh we lose uh around ten percent , uh ."
[06:42] me013 | Right .
"[06:43] mn007 | of ten percent , relative ."
"[06:46] mn007 | So this is not so bad . And then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well"
[06:54] me013 | Ab - about how much ?
"[06:56] mn007 | Around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . So . Yeah ."
[07:05] me013 | Twenty percent further ?
[07:05] mn007 | Twenty to to thirty percent further . Yeah .
"[07:08] me018 | And so , remind me , the multilingual stuff is just the broad data . Right ?"
[07:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[07:12] me018 | It 's not the digits . So it 's the combination of two things there .
[07:16] me018 | It 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages .
[07:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[07:23] mn007 | Yeah .
[07:24] me018 | OK .
"[07:25] me018 | Already , right right right ."
[07:28] me018 | So they were sort of building here ? OK ?
"[07:31] mn007 | Uh So , basically when it 's trained on the the multilingual broad data"
[07:50] mn007 | So .
[07:51] me013 | Yes .
"[07:55] me013 | I i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline ,"
"[08:01] me013 | for the for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three"
[08:08] mn007 | No no no .
[08:09] mn007 | Uh same language we are at uh for at English at O point eight .
[08:20] mn007 | So . Le - let me .
[08:21] me013 | I I I 'm sorry . I I I meant something different by baseline
[08:21] mn007 | Tas - task data we are u
[08:23] mn007 | Yeah .
[08:26] mn007 | Mmm .
[08:31] mn007 | Hmm .
[08:32] me013 | By baseline here I meant
"[08:34] mn007 | Oh yeah , the f"
"[08:36] mn007 | Yeah , OK . Yeah ."
[08:40] me013 | So I was just I just trying to understand that . So if we call
[08:40] mn007 | Yeah . Sure .
"[08:45] me013 | just normalized to one , the word error rate"
[08:45] mn007 | Mmm .
[08:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[09:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:11] mn007 | Yeah , it 's around one point one . Yeah ."
[09:13] me013 | Right .
[09:21] mn007 | Ye -
"[09:21] me013 | That 's what you were just saying , I think ."
[09:25] me018 | One point four ?
"[09:29] me018 | So , it 's an additional thirty percent ."
[09:31] mn007 | What would you say ? Around one point four yeah .
[09:33] me013 | OK .
"[09:38] mn007 | If we exclude English , um there is not much difference with the data with English ."
[09:46] mn007 | So .
[09:46] me013 | Aha !
[09:47] mn007 | Yeah .
[09:47] me013 | That 's interesting .
[09:50] mn007 | Uh .
"[09:51] me013 | No , that that 's important . So what what it 's saying here is just that "" yes , there is a reduction"
[10:11] mn007 | Hmm .
[10:18] me013 | So what 's the difference between two and three ?
[10:26] me018 | It 's multilingual .
[10:33] mn007 | Um Yeah .
"[10:33] me013 | Cuz in both in both both of those cases , you don't have the same task ."
[10:38] mn007 | Yeah sure .
[10:47] mn007 | Uh yeah .
"[10:48] me006 | Yeah , a fraction of it ."
[10:55] me013 | How m how much bigger is it ?
"[11:01] me006 | Yeah , um ."
"[11:02] mn007 | It 's two times , actually ? Yeah ."
[11:05] mn007 | Um .
"[11:18] mn007 | We just wanted to keep this , w well , not too huge . So ."
"[11:22] me013 | So it 's two times ,"
"[11:27] mn007 | Uh ,"
[11:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:29] me013 | And the broad English data is what you got this one point one with . So that 's TIMIT basically right ?
[11:34] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:34] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[11:34] me013 | So it 's band - limited TIMIT .
[11:36] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[11:36] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[11:37] me013 | This is all
[11:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:38] me006 | Downs -
[11:38] me013 | eight kilohertz sampling .
[11:39] me006 | Right .
"[11:40] me013 | So you have band - limited TIMIT , gave you uh"
[11:43] me013 | almost as good as a result as using TI - digits
[11:48] me013 | OK ?
[11:48] mn007 | Hmm ?
[11:49] me013 | Um and um
[12:07] mn007 | Yep .
[12:07] me013 | Both training and test ?
[12:09] me013 | Yeah . OK .
[12:11] me013 | Um
[12:16] me013 | OK .
[12:17] me013 | Well .
"[12:24] me013 | different task didn't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language"
[12:29] me013 | um
[12:41] mn007 | Mmm .
[12:42] me013 | It sounds like um
[13:05] me013 | in the training set .
[13:09] me013 | Um
[13:11] me013 | So these are results with
[13:20] me013 | Yeah .
[13:23] me013 | Yeah .
[13:40] mn007 | And then it 's it gets worse with the multilingual .
[13:48] mn007 | Yeah . There there is a difference actually with b between PLP and JRASTA is that
[14:05] mn007 | Mmm .
"[14:06] me013 | I have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind"
"[14:13] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
[14:23] me013 | Yeah .
[14:26] me018 | Um .
"[14:29] me013 | Uh ,"
"[14:30] me013 | this way and just slightly to the left , yeah ."
"[14:36] me018 | What was Was this number forty or It was roughly the same as this one , he said ? When you had the two language versus the three language ?"
[14:41] me013 | Um .
[14:44] me013 | That 's what he was saying .
"[14:44] me018 | That 's where he removed English , right ?"
[14:45] me006 | Yeah .
[14:46] me013 | Right .
"[14:47] me006 | It sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using ."
[14:50] me013 | Yeah .
[15:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[15:20] me018 | Mm - hmm . I wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? This multi - language uh labelling ?
[15:29] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[15:31] me006 | He was using uh sixty - four phonemes from SAMPA .
"[15:34] me018 | OK , OK ."
[15:35] me006 | Yeah .
[15:56] me018 | Yeah .
[15:57] me013 | And comparing different bad results can be tricky .
[15:58] me018 | Hmm .
[16:12] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:42] me013 | Wasn't there something of that ? Where you ,"
[16:49] fn002 | No .
"[16:50] me013 | I thought there was something like that ,"
"[16:55] me018 | Yeah , that would be interesting ."
"[16:56] me013 | Um ,"
[17:17] me013 | We 've never just trained on one lang
[17:22] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:23] mn007 | Uh , no ."
[17:29] me013 | But we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . Right ?
"[17:32] me013 | I mean , you haven't you haven't done all your tests on multiple languages ."
"[17:36] mn007 | Uh ,"
[17:38] mn007 | No .
[17:52] me018 | Did you do different languages from digits ?
[17:57] mn007 | Uh . No .
[17:58] mn007 | You mean
"[18:11] me013 | See , I thought you showed me something like that last week ."
"[18:17] mn007 | No , I don't think so ."
[18:23] me013 | Um
[18:29] me034 | These numbers are uh
"[18:30] me013 | So , I mean wha what 's the This this chart this table that we 're looking at is um ,"
[18:31] mn007 | So .
[18:43] mn007 | So you have uh basically two uh parts . The upper part is for TI - digits
[18:50] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[18:55] me013 | Yeah .
"[18:55] mn007 | And the first four rows is well - matched , then the s the second group of four rows is mismatched , and"
"[19:10] me018 | So , so the upper part is training TI - digits ?"
[19:10] mn007 | So .
"[19:14] mn007 | It 's it 's the HTK results , I mean . So it 's"
[19:33] me013 | Hmm .
[19:34] mn007 | So .
[19:34] mn007 | Uh
[19:37] mn007 | Yeah .
"[19:39] me013 | Well ,"
[19:40] me013 | What was is that i
[19:41] me013 | What was it that you had
[19:45] me013 | Wh - when you showed me the your table last week ?
[19:47] mn007 | It - It was part of these results .
[19:55] me018 | So where is the baseline for the TI - digits located in here ?
[20:01] mn007 | You mean the HTK Aurora baseline ?
[20:03] me018 | Yeah .
[20:04] mn007 | It 's uh the one hundred number .
"[20:06] mn007 | It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio"
[20:08] me018 | Ah !
"[20:11] me018 | Ah , OK , OK ."
"[20:12] me013 | So this is word word error rate , so a high number is bad ."
"[20:16] mn007 | Yeah , this is a word error rate ratio ."
[20:16] fn002 | Yeah .
[20:20] mn007 | Yeah .
"[20:20] me018 | OK , I see ."
[20:22] mn007 | seventy point two means that
"[20:26] me018 | OK , OK , gotcha ."
[20:29] mn007 | Hmm .
[20:35] me013 | let 's see
[20:44] mn007 | Yeah .
[20:47] me013 | um
[20:50] mn007 | To TIMIT .
[20:54] mn007 | Mmm .
"[20:54] mn007 | Then you have uh MF , MS and ME which are for French , Spanish and English ."
[21:32] me013 | Right .
"[21:34] me013 | So , I 'm sorry . I missed that . What 's MF , MS and ME ?"
"[21:37] me018 | Multi - French , Multi - Spanish"
"[21:37] mn007 | So . Multi - French , Multi - Spanish , and Multi - English ."
"[21:39] me013 | Uh OK . So , it 's uh broader vocabulary ."
[21:43] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:51] me013 | was
[21:57] me013 | and I was seeing
[22:00] me013 | I I think that was all it was . You had some very limited results that at that point
[22:03] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:12] me013 | where where English was removed .
"[22:26] me013 | Um now , what 's the noise condition"
[22:35] me013 | It 's the same uh Aurora noises
[22:37] mn007 | Yeah .
"[22:38] me013 | uh , in all these cases"
[22:39] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:41] me013 | So there 's not a statistical sta a strong st
"[22:48] mn007 | No these are the s s s same noises , yeah ."
[22:54] me006 | Well matched condition .
[22:55] me013 | Right .
[23:18] me013 | the other languages .
[23:20] mn007 | Mmm .
[23:24] me013 | So .
"[23:26] me013 | Um , oh I well , wait a minute . You have this here , for the Italian . That 's right . OK , so ,"
[23:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[23:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[23:58] mn007 | Mmm . Uh .
"[24:01] me013 | Well , I mean , let 's see ."
[24:09] mn007 | Yeah .
"[24:16] mn007 | There there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . Well ,"
[24:19] me013 | In in what ?
[24:21] mn007 | For for the Italian part I mean the
[24:35] me013 | And the noise is different in th
[24:41] me013 | Do we have any um
[24:51] me013 | have the same noise as in the Aurora ?
"[24:55] fn002 | Mmm , no ."
[24:57] mn007 | No .
[25:01] me018 | Can I ask something real quick ?
[25:18] mn007 | Yeah .
[25:19] me018 | I is that a noisy condition ?
[25:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[25:23] me018 | So that 's matched training ? Is that what that is ?
"[25:26] mn007 | It 's no , the third part , so it 's uh highly mismatched ."
[25:32] me018 | So why do you get your best number
[25:37] me018 | Wouldn't you get your best number in the clean case ?
"[25:39] me034 | Well , it 's relative to the"
[25:41] me034 | um
[25:42] mn007 | Yeah .
[25:43] mn007 | Yeah .
[25:46] me034 | Yeah .
[25:48] me018 | OK .
[26:02] mn007 | Yeah . But it 's not a clean case . It 's a noisy case but
[26:10] me018 | Oh ! So this upper third ?
[26:11] mn007 | So Yeah .
[26:13] me018 | Uh that 's still noisy ?
[26:15] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:15] me018 | Ah , OK ."
[26:20] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:23] me018 | I see .
[26:24] mn007 | Mmm .
[26:29] me013 | OK ?
"[26:33] me013 | So uh , I think this will take some looking at , thinking about . But ,"
"[26:45] mn007 | Uh , no we don't plan to fill the holes but"
[26:48] me013 | OK .
[27:31] mn007 | these are the results we obtained for Italian
[27:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[27:45] mn007 | Mmm .
"[27:48] mn007 | And the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the PLP twelve on - line normalization column ,"
"[28:07] me018 | Where is that ? seventy - nine , fifty"
"[28:09] me013 | Uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line ."
[28:10] mn007 | So .
"[28:14] me018 | Oh I see , OK ."
[28:15] mn007 | Just uh
[28:15] me013 | Yeah .
[28:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[28:26] me013 | Yes .
[28:28] me013 | Yes .
[28:48] mn007 | Yeah . There were diff there were different things and
[29:15] mn007 | So it adapts more quickly
[29:17] me013 | Yes . Yeah .
[29:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:00] me013 | Right . Right .
[30:02] mn007 | And Pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance
"[30:18] mn007 | Mmm . There were other minor differences , the fact that"
"[30:32] mn007 | Uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion ."
[30:44] me013 | OK .
[30:45] mn007 | We It it 's slightly uh different because
[31:00] me034 | Mm - hmm .
[31:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[31:10] mn007 | But , well it 's similar ."
[31:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[31:29] me013 | OK .
[31:31] mn007 | So basically what I expect is that
[31:37] me013 | Right .
[31:43] me013 | Right .
"[31:48] me013 | OK , but I think that"
[31:48] mn007 | Mmm .
"[31:51] me013 | because of that especially , we wanna draw some conclusions from this , do some reductions"
[31:56] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:02] me013 | So do you are you w
"[32:07] mn007 | No , I we plan to start this uh so , act actually we have discussed uh"
[32:34] mn007 | If we trained the networks on the on
[32:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[32:47] me013 | Mmm .
[33:23] me013 | I di
"[33:46] me013 | It 's a trade - off , right ? Any - anyway go ahead ."
"[34:00] mn007 | Doing something like , um"
"[34:06] mn007 | well , basically context dependent phonemes ."
"[34:13] me013 | Maybe . I mean , I I think"
[34:21] me013 | Right .
[34:27] me013 | Right ?
"[34:28] mn007 | Ye - yeah but here it 's something different . We want to have features uh well ,"
[34:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[34:34] me013 | Yeah , but it 's still true"
[34:51] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:52] me013 | Uh , and you 're putting it all together ,"
[34:57] me013 | That that 's true
"[35:02] me013 | in in a hybrid system ,"
[35:09] mn007 | Yeah .
[35:09] me013 | OK ? But I it 's it 's a big deal
[35:18] me013 | And once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context
[35:32] me013 | So um
"[35:40] me013 | a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur"
[35:53] me013 | We already actually don't have a huge amount of training data
"[36:02] mn007 | mmm ,"
"[36:05] mn007 | I mean , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and"
[36:16] me013 | Right .
[36:24] mn007 | Uh
[36:25] me013 | Almost .
[36:25] me013 | But I mean it it it does give a distribution .
[36:29] mn007 | Yeah .
"[36:30] me013 | and it is true that if there 's two phones that are very similar ,"
[36:41] mn007 | Yeah .
"[36:42] mn007 | Yeah , sure but uh"
"[37:00] me013 | Oh no , but it would still be even more of a binary decision ."
[37:12] me013 | That would be even even more distinct of a binary decision .
[37:15] me013 | I actually would have thought you 'd wanna go the other way and have fewer classes .
"[37:19] me013 | Uh , I mean for instance ,"
"[37:20] me013 | the the thing I was arguing for before , but"
[37:21] mn007 | Mmm .
"[37:22] me013 | again which I don't think we have time to try ,"
[37:29] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:38] mn007 | Yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . So ,"
[37:45] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[37:46] mn007 | Um You have more information in the
[37:47] me013 | True .
"[37:56] mn007 | But still the information is relevant because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate ,"
[37:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[38:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[38:09] mn007 | Mmm .
[38:11] mn007 | Mmm .
[38:18] mn007 | Mmm .
[38:32] mn007 | Mmm .
[38:51] me013 | Uh we haven't been doing any of the L D A RASTA sort of thing .
[38:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[39:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[39:11] me013 | So what i what is going on right now ? What 's right you 've got
[39:15] mn007 | N
"[39:18] fn002 | I I I 'm trying the HTK with eh ,"
"[39:28] me013 | The combination , I see ."
"[39:29] fn002 | The combination , yeah . But I haven't result at this moment ."
[39:33] me013 | MSG and and PLP .
[39:35] fn002 | Yeah .
"[39:39] fn002 | Ye - Uh , with the old older , yeah ."
[39:40] mn007 | Yeah .
[39:40] me013 | Old one .
[39:43] fn002 | Yeah . But We can
[39:45] fn002 | know soon .
[39:48] fn002 | I don't know .
[39:49] mn007 | Yeah .
"[39:50] me013 | Uh , OK ."
"[39:51] mn007 | Uh so there is this combination , yeah . Working on combination obviously ."
[39:55] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[40:10] fn002 | Yep .
[40:11] mn007 | Um .
[40:13] mn007 | And we think that
"[40:23] mn007 | So , get simpler networks ,"
[40:38] mn007 | Basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes .
[41:02] me006 | Twenty - seven .
[41:02] mn007 | Twenty - seven broad classes .
"[41:06] mn007 | So like , uh , oh , I don't know ,"
[41:11] mn007 | Um
[41:16] me013 | How many how many nets do you have ?
"[41:17] mn007 | For the moments we do not don't have nets , I mean ,"
[41:19] me013 | No nets .
[41:21] mn007 | Were we just changing the labels to retrain nets with fewer out outputs .
[41:21] fn002 | Begin to work in this .
[41:25] me013 | Right .
[41:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[41:30] me013 | Uh .
[41:50] mn007 | It -
[41:51] me018 | I think they have one output .
"[41:51] mn007 | It 's the single net , yeah ."
"[41:53] me013 | Oh , it 's just one net ."
[41:54] fn002 | Yeah .
[41:54] me006 | mm - hmm
[41:54] mn007 | It 's one net with
[41:59] me013 | I see .
"[42:01] me013 | I see , OK ."
"[42:02] mn007 | So it 's Well , it 's basically a standard net with fewer classes ."
[42:07] me013 | So you 're sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah .
"[42:10] mn007 | Yeah , but I think Yeah ."
[42:11] me006 | But including the features .
[42:11] mn007 | B b
"[42:12] mn007 | including the features , yeah ."
[42:13] mn007 | I don't think this will work alone .
[42:16] mn007 | I think it will get worse because
[42:18] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[42:18] mn007 | Well , I believe the effect that of of too"
[42:22] mn007 | reducing too much the information is
[42:28] me013 | But you think if you include that
"[42:30] mn007 | Yeah , because there is perhaps one important thing that the net"
"[42:40] mn007 | Because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . I mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after ."
"[42:50] mn007 | But perhaps , something intermediary using also"
"[43:02] me013 | well , somewhat broad . I mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four ,"
[43:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[43:06] me013 | And you have the original features .
"[43:09] me013 | Which are PLP , or something ."
[43:09] mn007 | Yeah .
[43:10] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:19] mn007 | There will probably be , yeah , one single KL to transform everything or"
[43:20] fn002 | Mu .
[43:24] me013 | Right .
[43:25] fn002 | No transform the PLP and only
[43:29] fn002 | transform the other
[43:31] fn002 | I 'm not sure .
[43:34] me013 | I see .
[43:35] fn002 | Two e
[43:36] mn007 | Yeah .
[43:38] me013 | Right .
[43:39] me013 | Whether you would transform together or just one .
[43:41] fn002 | @ @ it 's one .
[43:41] me013 | Yeah .
[43:43] me013 | But that 's interesting .
[43:49] mn007 | Yeah .
[43:50] me013 | Yeah .
[43:53] mn007 | Mmm .
"[43:58] mn007 | Uh , yeah ."
"[44:01] me013 | So I think , you know , we need to"
[44:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[44:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:20] me013 | Um , let me pass this out ,"
"[44:30] mn007 | Uh , no . I don't think so ."
"[44:40] me026 | Oh , thanks ."
[44:41] me013 | Ah ! OK .
[44:48] me013 | So they 're they 're doing the the VAD I guess they mean
[44:51] me013 | voice activity detection
[44:54] me013 | So they 've just trained up a net
[45:11] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:14] me013 | voice activity detection , or else just using the silence ,"
"[45:23] me013 | But on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net"
[45:29] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:38] me013 | Um , I mean , not uniformly ."
[45:46] mn007 | Mmm .
[45:50] fn002 | But they have a question of the result . Um how are trained the the LDA filter ?
[46:00] fn002 | How obtained the LDA filter ?
[46:01] mn007 | Mmm .
[46:03] me013 | I I 'm sorry . I don't understand your question .
"[46:03] fn002 | Yes , um the LDA filter"
[46:12] fn002 | I don't know exactly how they are obtained .
[46:14] me013 | It 's on training .
[46:21] fn002 | You understand me ?
[46:22] me013 | No .
"[46:23] fn002 | Yeah , uh for example ,"
[46:32] me013 | Yes .
"[46:46] me013 | Yes , I don't know ."
"[46:53] me013 | In earlier experiments , they had taken LDA"
[46:58] fn002 | Yeah .
"[46:59] fn002 | Yeah , because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own"
[47:04] mn007 | Mmm .
[47:05] fn002 | set .
"[47:08] me013 | Yeah , I don't know ."
"[47:10] me013 | but uh to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it I was mostly thinking about the the VAD ."
"[47:19] me013 | And um , it ap"
"[47:26] mn007 | The features , yeah ."
[47:28] mn007 | Yeah .
"[47:29] me013 | It says "" baseline ASP "" ."
"[47:35] mn007 | Yeah , I don't know ."
[47:35] me034 | ASP .
[47:38] me034 | Oh .
[47:39] me034 | There it is .
[47:46] me013 | Um
"[47:47] me013 | Cuz there 's "" baseline Aurora "" above it ."
"[47:52] me013 | This is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases ."
"[47:55] me034 | Well , it says baseline ASP is twenty - three mill"
[47:56] fn002 | Yeah .
[48:02] me034 | From the baseline . OK .
"[48:06] mn007 | I think it 's the C - zero using C - zero instead of log energy . Yeah , it 's this ."
[48:06] me013 | when when we were up in Oregon .
"[48:10] fn002 | Ah , OK , mm - hmm ."
[48:13] me013 | Oh .
[48:14] me013 | OK .
"[48:14] mn007 | It should be that , yeah ."
[48:16] me018 | They s
[48:16] me018 | they say in here that the VAD is not used as an additional feature . Does does anybody know how they 're using it ?
"[48:21] me013 | Yeah . So so what they 're doing here is ,"
[48:22] mn007 | Yeah .
[48:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:34] me013 | And so um ,"
[48:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[48:53] me034 | Hmm .
[48:54] me013 | Right ?
[48:59] me018 | I don't understand . You mean it 's throwing out frames ?
"[49:02] me013 | It 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah ."
"[49:03] me013 | There 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gonna be single cases of frames , or isolated frames ."
[49:07] me018 | Yeah .
"[49:16] me018 | Yeah , that 's what I was just gonna ask . How can you just throw out frames ?"
[49:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[49:19] me013 | Well ,"
[49:19] mn007 | i
[49:22] mn007 | Yeah .
[49:25] me018 | Yeah .
[49:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[49:29] me034 | Huh .
[49:30] mn007 | Yeah .
"[49:31] mn007 | Yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . And ."
[49:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[49:36] me013 | Yeah , so I mean in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gonna decode from here to here ."
[49:36] mn007 | I t
[49:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:41] me013 | I think they 're they 're they 're treating it ,"
[49:48] me018 | In the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of .
[49:55] me018 | So that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet .
[50:04] me013 | I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard .
[50:18] me018 | Yeah .
[50:19] me018 | Yeah .
[50:20] me013 | Um .
[50:20] me018 | I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this .
"[50:31] me013 | Certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice ,"
[50:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[50:44] me018 | Plus it 's gonna introduce delays .
[50:51] me018 | Mmm .
[51:07] me013 | I don't know Wh - what 's the difference between TLDA and SLDA ?
[51:09] me034 | Temporal and spectral .
[51:12] fn002 | Temporal LDA .
[51:15] me013 | So um .
[51:23] me013 | by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram I think means
[51:41] me013 | So um
"[51:44] me013 | I think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result"
"[52:13] me013 | But , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea ."
[52:31] me013 | combinations of features and multi - band
"[52:34] me013 | Uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues ."
[52:51] me013 | on - line normalization and the uh
"[53:11] me013 | Uh , because we still have even once we choose ,"
[53:19] me013 | but but uh
"[53:32] me018 | When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?"
"[53:40] me013 | Well , see they , I I think they 're"
[53:43] me013 | Um .
"[53:56] me018 | Oh , right ."
[53:59] me018 | Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ?
"[54:02] me013 | Uh , you know that 's what I had thought ."
[54:04] me013 | But I don't I don't think they are .
[54:05] me018 | Hmm .
[54:11] me013 | p put some low level noise or something .
[54:13] me013 | Probably don't want all zeros . Most recognizers don't like zeros but
[54:14] me018 | Hmm .
[54:17] me018 | Yeah .
[54:22] me018 | Some constant vector .
[54:24] me018 | I mean i w
[54:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[54:36] me018 | So that the the silence model in HTK will always pick it up .
[54:48] me018 | Hmm .
"[54:48] me013 | But whatever they did , I mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation ."
[54:51] me018 | Yeah .
[55:01] me018 | Yeah .
"[55:04] me018 | Yeah , yeah ."
[55:06] me013 | Yeah .
[55:08] me013 | Uh .
"[55:10] me013 | So , OK , So I think"
"[55:21] me013 | Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and and talk with everybody uh , outside of this meeting ."
"[55:28] me013 | Um , but uh"
[55:31] me013 | No I mean it sounds like I mean
[55:48] me013 | Um
[56:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[56:30] me013 | Uh
[56:35] me013 | I doubt it would help by forty per cent .
[56:39] mn007 | Yeah .
[56:42] me013 | Just curious .
"[56:50] mn007 | I think we 're alright , um , not much problems with that ."
[56:51] me013 | OK .
[56:55] me013 | Computation ?
"[57:02] me013 | Yeah . Yeah , well ."
[57:04] mn007 | But Yeah .
"[57:06] me013 | Are were you folks using Gin ? That 's a that just died , you know ?"
"[57:10] mn007 | Mmm , no . You were using Gin perhaps , yeah ? No ."
[57:13] fn002 | No .
"[57:16] me013 | Yeah ,"
[57:17] fn002 | Yes .
[57:24] me034 | Tonic .
[57:30] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[57:32] me013 | U
[57:33] me013 | Go ahead .
"[57:33] me026 | Do we have that big new IBM machine the , I think in th"
[57:38] me013 | We have the little tiny IBM machine
"[57:44] me013 | It 's got s slots for eight ,"
"[57:57] me013 | So instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz ."
[58:03] me013 | And more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . So I don't think
"[58:18] me013 | Hopefully , they 'll get us some more"
"[58:24] me013 | Uh , yeah , I think that 'll be once we get it populated ,"
[58:30] me013 | And uh and uh a nice amount of memory . Uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast Linux machine .
"[58:36] me026 | And if we can do things on Linux , some of the machines we have going already , like Swede ?"
[58:41] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[58:41] me026 | Um
[58:42] me026 | It seems pretty fast .
[58:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[58:45] me026 | I think Fudge is pretty fast too .
[59:14] me013 | There 's there 's there 's gonna be debugging hassles
[59:22] me013 | But .
[59:31] me026 | I is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the HTK runs that are slowing us down ?
"[59:41] me013 | Uh , I think yes ."
"[59:45] me013 | Isn't that right ? I mean I think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ?"
[59:55] mn007 | Mmm .
[59:57] mn007 | Yeah .
[59:59] me013 | It sounded like they were roughly equal ?
[00:01] me013 | Is that about right ?
[00:02] mn007 | Yeah .
[00:03] me013 | Yeah .
"[00:05] me026 | Because , um I think that 'll be running Linux , and Sw - Swede and Fudge are already running Linux so , um I could try to"
"[00:12] me026 | get um the train the neural network trainings or the HTK stuff running under Linux , and to start with I 'm wondering which one I should pick first ."
[00:49] mn007 | For HTK ?
[00:52] mn007 | Uh
[00:55] me013 | OK .
[00:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[00:57] me013 | OK .
[01:05] mn007 | Mmm .
[01:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[01:31] me018 | They have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in H T K ."
[01:35] me013 | Yeah ?
[01:35] me018 | And you can parallelize the training .
[01:38] me018 | And run it on several machines and it just basically keeps counts .
[01:38] me013 | Aha !
[01:45] mn007 | Mmm .
[01:45] me013 | I see .
[01:50] mn007 | Yeah .
[01:50] me013 | Something that we haven't really settled on yet is other than
[02:16] me013 | Um .
"[02:18] me013 | So I I think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we 're gonna use the neural net trainings ,"
"[02:23] me013 | no matter what ,"
[02:24] me026 | OK .
"[02:24] me013 | for a lot of the things we 're doing ,"
"[02:26] me013 | whereas , w exactly which"
[02:28] me013 | HMM Gaussian - mixture - based HMM thing we use is gonna depend
[02:33] me013 | uh
"[02:37] me013 | So with that ,"
[02:41] me013 | go to our
"[02:53] me013 | And , it 's about eleven fifty ."
"[03:06] me013 | Uh , I can I can start over here ."
"[08:29] me013 | Great , uh , could you give Adam a call . Tell him to"
[08:32] me013 | He 's at two nine seven seven .
"[08:39] me013 | @ @ You know Herve 's coming tomorrow , right ?"
"[08:44] me013 | Herve will be giving a talk , yeah , talk at eleven ."
"[08:47] me006 | Hello , is Adam there ?"
"[08:48] me006 | Hey Adam , this is Barry ."
[08:49] me006 | Yeah we 're all done .
"[08:54] me013 | Did uh , did everybody sign these consent"
[08:57] me013 | Er everybody
"[08:58] me013 | Has everyone signed a consent form before , on previous meetings ? You don't have to do it again each time"
[09:05] me013 | Yes .
[09:07] me013 | microphones off

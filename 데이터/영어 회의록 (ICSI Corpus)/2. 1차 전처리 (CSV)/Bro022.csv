"[00:03] me013 | I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done ."
"[00:09] me018 | And what was that , Morgan ?"
[00:11] me018 | What project ?
"[00:12] me013 | Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip ."
[00:15] mn007 | Yeah .
[00:29] me018 | It was true for two years .
"[00:35] me018 | So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we go around and do , uh ,"
[00:39] me018 | status report kind of things ?
[00:42] me018 | OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something .
[00:47] me018 | So .
[00:47] me013 | Yeah . So we probably should wait for him to come before we do his .
[00:50] me018 | OK . That 's a good idea .
[00:50] me006 | OK .
[00:50] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[00:52] me018 | Any objection ?
"[00:56] me018 | Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or ?"
"[01:07] me013 | since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves ."
"[01:11] me006 | OK . So should I go so that , uh ,"
"[01:13] me018 | Yeah . Why don't you go ahead , Barry ?"
"[01:14] me006 | you 're gonna talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? OK . Um ."
[01:16] me018 | OK .
"[01:18] me006 | Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal ."
"[01:28] me006 | Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify ,"
"[01:36] me006 | um , as a as a middle step . And , um , I hope to hope to get this , um a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan ."
"[01:48] me018 | When is your , uh , meeting ?"
"[01:50] me006 | Um , my meeting with , uh ? Oh , oh , you mean the the quals . Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth ."
[01:52] me018 | Yeah .
[01:54] me018 | The quals . Yeah .
[01:59] me018 | Oh . Soon .
[02:00] me006 | Yeah . D - Day .
[02:01] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[02:04] me018 | So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and ?"
"[02:15] me006 | And , um , and then , um then everybody asks you questions ."
[02:21] me018 | Hmm .
[02:22] me006 | Yeah .
[02:23] me018 | I remember now .
"[02:28] me006 | Yep . So , um . Y s"
[02:29] me018 | Have you d ?
"[02:30] me018 | I was just gonna ask , do you want to say any a little bit about it , or ?"
"[02:33] me006 | Oh . Uh , a little bit about ?"
[02:34] me018 | Mmm .
"[02:37] me006 | Oh , the the Right . Well , I was , um ,"
"[02:43] me006 | I think one of the perplexing problems is , um ,"
[02:47] me006 | for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features in intermediate categories to to classify right away .
"[03:05] me006 | like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to just to start off that way ."
"[03:10] me006 | And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques ."
[03:24] me006 | Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition .
"[03:28] me006 | Look at then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category ."
[03:40] me006 | That would that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions .
"[03:48] me006 | Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again ."
[04:02] me018 | So you 're gonna use TIMIT ?
"[04:03] me006 | Um , for that for that part of the the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT ."
[04:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[04:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:19] me006 | that 's , um that 's just the ph the phone recognition task ."
[04:22] me018 | Yeah .
"[04:23] me006 | Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word ."
"[04:27] me006 | So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard ,"
"[04:34] me006 | uh , where I 'd I would be able to , um to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , not just within the phonemes , themselves ,"
[04:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:44] me006 | um , and then do the same process there , um , on on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard ."
"[04:55] me006 | for that part I would I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for for Switchboard . And I 'd run some some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers ."
[05:08] me018 | Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files .
[05:11] me006 | Yeah . That 's why I I was asking about that . Yeah .
[05:12] me018 | Yeah .
[05:14] me018 | Yeah .
[05:22] me006 | I guess that 's that 's it . Any any questions ?
"[05:29] me018 | Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ?"
"[05:33] me006 | Um , yeah . A few more ."
[05:35] me018 | It 's about a month from now ?
[05:36] me006 | It 's a it 's a month and and a week .
[05:38] me018 | Yeah .
[05:38] me006 | Yeah .
"[05:45] me026 | Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach ."
"[05:54] me026 | And , um , we we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um ,"
"[06:05] me026 | six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n"
"[06:09] me026 | on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent ."
"[06:22] me026 | And , um ,"
"[06:27] me026 | considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so ,"
[06:46] me026 | This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case .
[07:03] me026 | So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio .
[07:11] me026 | And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech
"[07:17] me026 | in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone ,"
"[07:28] me026 | depending on the timing of the echo . So , um ,"
"[07:43] me026 | set of , um , read speech , and , um Hmm ."
"[07:56] me013 | some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were ,"
"[07:59] me013 | um , getting rid of low - energy sections ?"
"[08:06] me013 | if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation ,"
"[08:13] me013 | uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that ,"
"[08:23] me013 | an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values ,"
[08:29] me013 | and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum .
"[08:33] me013 | So , what what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero set the negative values to zero ."
"[08:38] me013 | So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive ,"
"[08:41] me013 | which is the time trajectory of energy ,"
"[08:45] me013 | um , and , uh , shifting it downwards ,"
"[08:48] me013 | and then getting rid of the negative parts ,"
[08:50] me013 | that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things .
[08:52] me013 | And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech
"[09:00] me013 | So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of"
"[09:06] me013 | some of the other effects of reverberation ,"
"[09:08] me013 | but because you have these non - causal windows ,"
"[09:11] me013 | you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n"
"[09:14] me013 | And , um , what if you did ?"
"[09:17] me013 | I mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted"
[09:22] me013 | to trying to get it back to
"[09:24] me013 | the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also"
[09:25] me026 | Uh - huh .
[09:30] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:31] me013 | And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing and you actually could"
"[09:36] me013 | take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value ."
[09:43] me026 | Uh - huh .
"[09:43] me013 | I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you 're hearing"
"[09:50] me013 | or pre - echoes , whichever they are are are ,"
"[09:53] me013 | uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them ."
[09:59] me026 | Uh - huh .
[10:02] me013 | Be pretty simple .
[10:04] me026 | OK .
"[10:05] me013 | I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech ."
[10:14] me026 | Hmm .
"[10:14] mn052 | Um , what is the reverberation time like there ?"
"[10:18] mn052 | On , uh , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ?"
[10:22] me026 | Y Yeah . I I I I don't know .
"[10:26] mn052 | It 's , uh Oh , this room ? OK ."
"[10:29] me013 | this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on ."
[10:29] me006 | Oh .
"[10:33] me013 | Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's I would guess , uh ,"
"[10:38] me013 | point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T - sixty something like that ?"
[10:42] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:42] me013 | But it 's you know , it 's this room ."
[10:44] mn052 | OK .
[10:45] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[10:45] me013 | Uh .
"[10:48] me013 | But the other thing is , he 's putting in w I was using the word "" reverberation "" in two ways . He 's also putting in ,"
"[10:54] me013 | he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds ,"
"[11:03] me013 | which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since ,"
[11:12] mn052 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[11:13] me013 | So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .
"[11:19] me013 | Uh , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things ."
[11:25] mn052 | Yeah .
"[11:26] me026 | O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized ."
"[11:36] me026 | So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ?"
[11:43] me026 | Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .
[11:48] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:50] mn007 | I don't see why why your signal is louder after processing , because yo"
"[11:54] me026 | Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either ."
[11:56] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:57] me013 | I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .
[12:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:01] me026 | Oh , OK ."
"[12:02] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals ,"
[12:06] me013 | what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio .
"[12:10] me013 | So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better ."
[12:15] me026 | It w i i it wouldn't affect things . OK .
[12:17] mn007 | Yeah .
[12:17] me013 | No .
[12:24] mn007 | on the signal level .
"[12:27] mn007 | But , not so much , I guess ."
[12:29] mn007 | Mmm .
[12:31] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:34] me013 | in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect ."
[12:37] mn007 | Yeah .
"[12:38] me018 | Did you add this data to the training set , for the Aurora ?"
[12:42] me018 | Or you just tested on this ?
[12:43] me026 | Um .
[12:46] me026 | Did I w what ? Sorry ?
[12:51] me026 | Yeah .
[12:52] me018 | I was sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data . You didn't train it also .
[12:57] me026 | I Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .
"[13:02] me013 | Oh , I see ."
"[13:08] me026 | I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder ."
"[13:13] me013 | OK . Well , I don't understand then . Yeah ."
[13:15] me026 | Huh .
"[13:15] me026 | I don't know . If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is"
[13:25] me026 | that taking it out makes things louder .
[13:32] me026 | I mean .
"[13:33] me013 | Uh , no . I mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about"
[13:35] me026 | Nuh - huh .
"[13:39] me013 | removing if you 're really removing ,"
[13:42] me026 | The mean .
"[13:45] me026 | OK . Yeah , I see . Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again ."
"[13:54] me013 | Uh , yeah . I don't know ."
[13:55] me026 | Oh . OK .
"[14:02] me018 | for s for the PZM data , uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike ."
[14:11] me018 | Uh .
"[14:14] me018 | I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um you know , doing the mean normalization where ,"
"[14:18] me018 | uh , it it could cause you to have better signal - to - noise ratio ."
[14:24] me018 | Um .
"[14:25] me013 | Well , you know , there is this ."
[14:31] me013 | Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum .
"[14:37] me013 | So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number ,"
[14:45] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:45] me013 | you could make it bigger .
[14:46] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:51] me013 | there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing ,"
[14:54] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:56] me013 | Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger , but"
[14:59] me013 | maybe in practice it is .
[15:00] me013 | That 's something to think about . I don't know .
"[15:04] mn007 | I had a question about the system the SRI system . So , you trained it on TI - digits ?"
"[15:11] mn007 | But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on Macrophone . Right ?"
[15:18] mn007 | So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight .
"[15:25] mn007 | Uh , but is it exactly the same system ?"
[15:26] me026 | Uh .
"[15:29] me026 | I think so . If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system ."
[15:30] mn007 | Hmm .
[15:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:35] mn007 | So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um ,"
[15:38] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[15:44] mn007 | all that stuff .
"[15:49] mn007 | It was training on Macrophone and testing yeah , on on meeting digits ."
"[15:56] me013 | Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK ."
[15:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[16:05] me013 | OK .
"[16:05] mn007 | Yeah . I I 've just been text testing the new Aurora front - end with well , Aurora system actually so front - end and HTK ,"
"[16:15] mn007 | um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have I have two point seven percent error rate ."
[16:35] mn007 | Yeah . Two point seven .
"[16:37] mn052 | I know in the meeting , like Right ."
[16:38] mn007 | On the meeting we have two point seven .
[16:41] me006 | That 's with the new IIR filters ?
[16:45] me006 | OK .
"[16:51] mn007 | I think , maybe I didn't look , but"
"[16:59] mn007 | Do y did you have a look at at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or ?"
[17:08] me026 | I didn't . No .
[17:09] mn007 | Oh .
[17:12] me013 | Hmm .
"[17:12] mn052 | No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are recording it through a"
"[17:17] mn052 | mike . I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it ."
"[17:22] me013 | Yeah . But this uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold"
[17:28] me013 | in the A - toD. And these period these typically do have a DC offset .
"[17:33] mn052 | Oh , OK ."
[17:33] me013 | And and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics .
"[17:36] mn052 | Oh , so it is the digital OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in ."
"[17:40] me013 | Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC . But but ,"
[17:41] mn052 | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . OK .
"[17:44] me013 | typi you know , unless Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC . But but ,"
[17:49] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[17:52] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:53] me013 | then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get ,"
[17:58] me013 | I think it was in the Wall Street Journal data
[18:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[18:06] me013 | messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then
"[18:15] mn052 | Oh , OK ."
[18:16] mn052 | OK .
"[18:18] me018 | So was that was that everything , Dave ?"
"[18:21] me026 | Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments about normalizing the phase ."
"[18:34] me026 | the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea ,"
"[18:39] me026 | um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time"
"[18:45] me026 | and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um ,"
"[18:49] me026 | so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um ,"
"[18:58] me026 | um ,"
[18:59] me026 | there 's reason to believe that
"[19:07] me026 | took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that ,"
[19:14] me026 | and I subtracted that phase off
"[19:18] me026 | to normalize . But that , um ,"
[19:21] me026 | didn't work either .
[19:32] me018 | What does it leave ?
"[19:34] me013 | Uh , it leaves you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I I think it 's it 's tremendous ."
"[19:37] me006 | Oh , wow ."
"[19:46] me013 | So , it 's it 's a general rule . Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite ."
"[20:02] me026 | And , yeah , that 's everything ."
[20:03] me018 | All set ?
"[20:06] me018 | Do you want to go , Stephane ?"
"[20:12] mn007 | still , these meeting digits ."
[20:15] mn007 | I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system .
"[20:24] mn007 | Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because this is also one big difference between the two systems ."
"[20:44] mn007 | But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and"
[20:49] me018 | It didn't seem to help in the HTK system .
[20:49] mn007 | it was hard t to to have some exper some improvement with this . Um .
[20:57] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:58] me013 | uh , different kinds of adaptation . You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation ."
[21:00] mn007 | Yeah . Right .
[21:02] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:02] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[21:06] mn007 | The vocal tr
"[21:12] me018 | conversation - side normalization for the non - C - zero components , and then utterance normalization for the C - zero components ."
[21:19] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:21] mn007 | Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like
[21:25] mn007 | on on the utterance levels .
[21:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:33] me018 | Right .
[21:35] mn007 | it might be better with it might be worse if
[21:37] me018 | Yeah .
[21:42] mn007 | Nnn .
[21:42] mn052 | And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ?
[21:48] mn007 | SRI it 's it 's tr Yeah . I guess it 's triphones .
[21:48] me006 | SRI .
[21:49] mn052 | Yeah .
[21:51] mn052 | It 's triphone .
"[21:52] me013 | I think it 's probably more than that . I mean , so they they have I I thin think they use these , uh ,"
[21:52] mn007 | Huh .
"[21:58] me013 | uh , genone"
[22:05] me013 | and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .
[22:07] mn052 | Oh . It 's like the tied state .
[22:08] me013 | So .
[22:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:11] me013 | I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think I think they they don't just have triphones . I think they have a range of of , uh , dependencies ."
[22:13] mn052 | OK .
[22:16] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[22:24] mn007 | Yeah . Well . Um .
"[22:34] mn007 | And maybe see with Andreas if Well , I I don't know how much it helps , what 's the model ."
"[22:39] me018 | So so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ?"
[22:48] mn007 | That 's right . So it 's the clean TI - digits training set .
[22:52] me018 | So exact same training data ?
[22:52] mn007 | Right .
[22:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[22:54] me018 | OK .
[22:56] mn007 | I guess you used the clean training set .
[22:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm . Well .
"[23:01] me026 | You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered"
"[23:11] me026 | um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the"
"[23:16] me026 | original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which don't have this filter . But I don't think there 's any other difference ."
[23:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[23:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[23:28] mn007 | Yeah .
"[23:29] me013 | So is that ? Uh , are are these results comparable ? So you you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline"
[23:35] me013 | something like two point four percent on
"[23:39] me013 | clean TI - digits ,"
"[23:41] me013 | when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits . Right ?"
[23:47] me026 | Um . Uh - huh .
[23:47] me013 | And Yeah .
"[23:48] me013 | And , so , is your two point seven comparable ,"
"[23:51] me013 | where you 're , uh , uh , using ,"
"[23:54] me013 | uh , the submitted system ?"
[23:57] mn007 | Yeah . I think so . Yeah .
"[23:58] me013 | OK . So it 's about the same , maybe a little worse ."
[23:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:01] me026 | W w it was one one point two
[24:03] mn007 | Ye -
[24:05] mn007 | Yeah . The complete SRI system is one point two . Yeah .
[24:10] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:20] me013 | um , two point f"
[24:23] mn007 | It was four point something . Right ?
"[24:25] mn007 | The HTK system with , uh , b"
[24:25] me026 | D d
[24:28] me026 | Do you mean the b ?
"[24:29] me026 | The baseline Aurora - two system ,"
"[24:32] me026 | trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent ."
[24:37] mn007 | Oh .
"[24:37] me013 | Right . Right , right , right . OK ."
[24:44] me013 | He 's doing some different things .
[24:48] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:51] mn007 | Um .
[24:54] mn007 | Yeah . And another thing I I maybe would like to do is to just test
"[24:58] mn007 | the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone test it on ,"
[25:04] mn007 | cuz I 'm still wondering where this improvement
"[25:09] mn007 | comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits ."
[25:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:27] mn007 | Uh , f s"
"[25:27] me018 | You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh to do the regular Aurora test , um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK ."
"[25:34] mn007 | That 's Yeah . That 's what I wanted , just , uh Yeah ."
"[25:38] mn007 | So , just using the SRI system , test"
[25:40] mn007 | it on and test it on Aurora TI - digits . Right .
"[25:45] me018 | Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ?"
[25:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[25:55] mn007 | i i
[25:57] me018 | Right .
[25:58] mn007 | Yeah .
"[25:58] me018 | Yeah . That 's what I mean . So , like , comple"
"[26:01] me018 | Mmm . Well , I mean , uh ,"
[26:02] mn007 | Mmm .
"[26:04] me018 | uh ,"
[26:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:15] me018 | Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh you 're also training on all the"
[26:20] mn007 | That 's right . Yeah .
"[26:23] mn007 | Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean ."
"[26:26] me013 | That 's true , but I think that also"
"[26:29] me013 | when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK ."
[26:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:39] me013 | So , it 's it 's a good idea , but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning"
[26:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:45] me013 | first with a a test or two that makes sense for you , and then take the likely candidates and go further ."
[26:47] me018 | Yeah . Yeah .
[26:53] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:54] mn007 | But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some"
[26:58] mn007 | information about what 's going on .
"[27:09] mn007 | Uh , yeah . OK ."
"[27:10] mn007 | Uh , the next thing is this this VAD problem that ,"
"[27:25] mn007 | I sent you so , whi that shows that"
"[27:32] mn007 | uh , the current VAD approach doesn't drop much frames for"
"[27:38] mn007 | some particular noises ,"
"[27:40] mn007 | uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically ."
[27:47] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:47] me013 | They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . So does any of this matter ?"
"[27:58] mn007 | Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh like we would have"
[28:03] mn007 | t
[28:05] mn007 | two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech . Uh .
[28:20] mn007 | No . Because we don't didn't
[28:23] me013 | Yeah .
"[28:23] mn007 | looked that much at that . But , still ,"
"[28:29] me013 | Oh , yeah ."
[28:30] mn007 | Um .
[28:31] mn007 | Yeah .
"[28:38] me013 | Because there 's lots of interesting problems , of course . And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight ,"
"[28:40] mn007 | Mm - hmm . Yeah , yeah ."
[28:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:46] me013 | uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue ."
[28:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[28:51] me013 | Um But I don't know .
"[28:53] mn052 | Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual"
"[28:59] mn052 | segmentation . And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the"
"[29:07] mn052 | point around , I mean , the way we want"
"[29:09] mn052 | to find a I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us ."
"[29:16] mn052 | But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore , because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation ."
[29:16] me013 | Right .
[29:16] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[29:25] me013 | Right .
[29:25] mn052 | So . We don't know what is the type of VAD which they 're going to provide .
[29:27] me013 | Yeah .
[29:29] mn007 | Yeah .
"[29:33] mn007 | Yeah . There 's an uh , I think it 's still for even for the evaluation ,"
"[29:38] mn007 | uh , it might still be interesting to work on this because the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just ,"
[29:52] mn007 | Um .
"[29:53] mn052 | With some some gap . I mean , with some pauses in the center ,"
[29:57] mn052 | provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .
"[30:04] mn052 | Yeah . Then the they will just fill fill it up . I mean , th Yeah ."
"[30:07] me013 | So if you could get at some of that , uh although that 'd be hard . But but Yeah ."
[30:09] mn007 | Yeah . It might be useful
[30:10] mn052 | Yeah .
"[30:11] mn007 | for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other things that we want to work on . But Mmm ."
[30:15] me013 | Right . OK .
[30:21] mn007 | Yeah . So I did I just started to test putting together two VAD which was was not much work actually .
"[30:29] mn007 | Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the ,"
"[30:45] mn007 | So , which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy ,"
"[30:49] mn007 | and , detect detecting the first group of four frames that have a energy that 's above this threshold ,"
"[30:59] mn007 | and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech ."
[31:06] mn007 | So it removes
[31:16] mn007 | still o on the noises where our MLP VAD doesn't work a lot .
[31:21] me013 | Mmm .
"[31:30] me013 | uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance uh , would give you"
[31:36] me013 | some better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy
"[31:40] me013 | fricatives or or , uh stop consonants , or something like that ."
[31:46] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:46] me013 | Uh .
[31:50] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:05] me013 | And , um , just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic ,"
[32:14] me013 | some sort of slope .
"[32:15] me013 | And and most ,"
[32:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[32:22] me013 | a high - pass kind of characteristic an upward slope .
[32:25] mn007 | Yeah .
"[32:27] me013 | uh , you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas ,"
[32:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:39] me013 | a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough"
[32:51] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[32:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:03] mn007 | so , removes like low ,"
"[33:09] mn007 | low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because the way I do it is I just I just combine"
"[33:15] mn007 | the two decisions so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based with the with the and operator . So ,"
[33:22] mn007 | I only keep the frames where the two agree that it 's speech .
"[33:28] mn007 | So if the energy - based dropped dropped low - energy speech ,"
"[33:32] mn007 | mmm , they they are they are lost ."
[33:35] mn007 | Mmm .
[33:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:37] mn007 | But s still , the way it 's done right now it it helps on on the noises where it seems to help on the noises where"
"[33:52] me013 | combining them in different ways . But but ,"
[33:54] me013 | I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information .
[33:59] mn007 | Yeah .
[34:00] me013 | So .
"[34:03] mn007 | Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done Well , yeah ."
[34:14] me013 | Is ?
"[34:14] mn007 | The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are are , uh , dropped ,"
"[34:19] mn007 | even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them ."
[34:19] me013 | Right .
"[34:23] mn007 | But , yeah ."
[34:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[34:24] me018 | No -
"[34:28] me013 | uh , a probability estimated by each one and and put them together ."
[34:31] mn007 | Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah .
"[34:32] me018 | Something that that I 've used in the past is , um when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative ."
[34:39] me018 | And you make your decision when the derivative is increasing for so many frames .
[34:44] me018 | Then you say that 's beginning of speech .
[34:44] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[34:47] me018 | But , I 'm I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you"
[34:51] me018 | keep some amount of speech in a buffer .
"[34:55] me018 | I guess it depends on how you do it . But I mean , that 's that 's been a useful thing ."
[34:57] me013 | Yeah .
[34:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:02] mn052 | Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,"
[35:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[35:08] mn052 | then only make a decision because you still need to smooth the decision further .
[35:11] me018 | Right . Right .
[35:14] mn052 | So that 's always there .
[35:15] me018 | Yeah . OK .
[35:26] mn007 | what I observed was the re was caused by this this VAD problem . And it seems to be the case .
[35:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:36] mn007 | Uh , the second thing is the this spectral subtraction . Um ."
"[35:50] mn007 | twenty - five experiments ,"
"[35:52] mn007 | uh , with different ,"
"[35:55] mn007 | uh , values for the parameters that are used . So ,"
"[35:58] mn007 | it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more ,"
[36:09] mn007 | noise than
"[36:10] mn007 | the noise spectra that is estimated on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances ."
"[36:18] mn007 | So I tried several ,"
"[36:23] mn007 | And after subtraction , I also add a constant noise , and I also try different ,"
"[36:30] mn007 | uh ,"
[36:39] me013 | Hmm .
"[36:48] mn007 | Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but"
"[36:51] mn007 | for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise ."
[36:59] mn007 | Um .
"[37:00] mn007 | On the other hand , when you subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but maybe you distort a lot of speech . So ."
[37:14] mn007 | Mmm .
[37:22] mn007 | We 'll see .
"[37:23] mn007 | So the next thing , maybe I what I will try to to do is just to try to smooth"
"[37:44] mn052 | Can smooth the SNR estimate , also ."
[37:47] mn007 | Yeah . Right .
[37:49] mn007 | Mmm .
[37:51] mn052 | Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?
[37:58] mn052 | Yeah .
[37:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[38:01] mn007 | Yeah .
"[38:07] mn052 | Uh . I don't know , it 's go ahead . And it 's go ahead ."
[38:14] mn052 | OK .
[38:17] mn052 | u
"[38:18] mn052 | th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And"
"[38:21] mn052 | there are there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up ."
"[38:25] mn052 | Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh , the initial frames were silence ."
"[38:31] mn052 | It always started in the silence state , but it wasn't for some utterances ."
"[38:35] mn052 | So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially ,"
"[38:38] mn052 | and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always"
[38:41] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[38:42] mn052 | silence .
[38:42] mn007 | So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ?
"[38:46] mn052 | Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are ."
[38:47] mn007 | o
[38:49] mn007 | Uh - huh .
"[38:54] mn052 | And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and"
"[39:03] mn052 | how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also ."
"[39:09] mn052 | And so the the trend seems to be like ,"
[39:14] mn052 | smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the
"[39:18] mn052 | SNR , which is like deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant ."
"[39:31] mn052 | the More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like it 's still comparable to the baseline . I haven't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter ."
"[39:41] mn052 | And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with"
"[39:55] mn052 | So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise"
"[40:02] mn052 | and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit ."
"[40:06] mn052 | So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that if"
"[40:13] mn052 | some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And"
[40:21] mn052 | so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech .
"[40:25] mn052 | So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions ."
"[40:43] mn052 | the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system ,"
"[40:48] mn052 | which is , uh , just the spectral I mean , the mel sp"
"[40:52] mn052 | mel , uh , frequency coefficients ."
[40:55] mn052 | Um .
[40:56] mn052 | And the other thing that I tried was but I just
"[41:03] mn052 | which Hynek had ,"
"[41:05] mn052 | to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And"
[41:11] mn052 | it 's it seems to be like it 's not
[41:19] mn052 | a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum .
"[41:24] mn052 | So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had ."
"[41:47] mn052 | and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently , or"
[41:57] mn052 | Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum .
"[41:59] me013 | So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ?"
"[42:03] mn052 | Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now ."
"[42:06] mn052 | So it has , like the spectrogram has , like Uh , it actually ,"
"[42:11] mn052 | uh , enhances the onset and offset of I mean , the the begin and the end of the speech ."
"[42:16] mn052 | So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure ."
[42:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:24] mn052 | So , those are the regions where there are , like when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech ."
[42:24] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:29] mn052 | But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice ."
[42:32] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:32] mn052 | So .
[42:34] mn052 | That 's something I observe using that filter .
"[42:38] mn052 | Yeah . There are a few very not a lot of because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion ,"
[42:44] mn052 | so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root .
"[42:50] mn052 | I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters ,"
[42:57] mn052 | and but while making this Wiener filter better .
"[43:01] mn052 | Yeah . That that 's it , Morgan ."
"[43:05] me013 | Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ?"
"[43:17] mn052 | th you know , things , and I didn't work much on that ."
"[43:26] me018 | How about you , Carmen ?"
"[43:28] fn002 | Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week ,"
"[43:36] fn002 | eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy ."
[43:44] me013 | Hmm ?
"[43:53] fn002 | But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise ."
"[44:00] fn002 | And Well , thinking"
[44:05] fn002 | we then we decide that maybe is a good idea . We don't know . I don't hav I don't this is I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS
[44:32] me013 | So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .
"[44:44] me013 | uh , you could do some normalization s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after ."
[44:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:59] fn002 | Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain ."
"[45:09] fn002 | And Well . I am working in that now , but I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I don't know . It 's k it 's k"
[45:11] me013 | Uh - huh .
[45:22] me013 | Uh - huh .
[45:25] me013 | Yeah .
[45:34] fn002 | I don't have any feeling if this will work better than
[45:44] fn002 | in filter bank domain .
[45:47] fn002 | I r I 'm not sure . I don't I don't know absolutely nothing .
[45:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:52] me013 | Yeah . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so ,"
[46:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[46:04] me013 | Um .
"[46:07] mn007 | Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so the codebook is"
[46:11] fn002 | Yeah ?
"[46:25] mn007 | to , uh , be a better"
[46:27] mn007 | model of speech .
[46:29] mn007 | And . Well .
"[46:35] mn007 | No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median ."
[46:37] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[46:39] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[46:46] mn007 | But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean of speech and
[46:52] fn002 | Ye -
[46:52] mn007 | not of noise . Because it 's like first doing general normalization and then
"[47:05] fn002 | to estimate the noise with the first frames and then apply the VAD ,"
[47:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:14] fn002 | before the on - line normalization .
[47:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:23] me013 | Yeah .
"[47:25] me013 | Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is"
"[47:31] me013 | as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because we 've talked about"
[47:38] me013 | potentially doing some combination of a couple of them .
[47:46] me013 | should be combined .
"[47:57] me018 | OK ? Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ?"
[48:00] me013 | Sure .

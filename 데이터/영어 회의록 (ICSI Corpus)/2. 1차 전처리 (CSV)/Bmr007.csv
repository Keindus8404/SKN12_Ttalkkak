[00:00] mn005 | @ @
"[00:00] fe016 | We 're ,"
[00:00] me013 | Yeah .
[00:00] fe016 | I mean
[00:01] me013 | Yeah .
[00:01] mn005 | OK .
[00:03] fe016 | We didn't have a house before .
[00:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[00:05] me018 | That is really great .
[00:05] me013 | OK -
"[00:06] fe016 | Oh , yeah !"
[00:06] me018 | That 's terrific .
[00:09] me011 | please do so .
[00:09] me011 | The new consent form .
[00:10] me011 | The new and improved consent form .
"[00:12] me018 | Now you won't be able to walk or ride your bike , huh ?"
[00:12] fe008 | Uh .
[00:12] me013 | OK .
[00:13] me013 | OK .
[00:14] fe016 | Right .
"[00:16] me013 | Uh , we were gonna do that at the end , remember ?"
"[00:18] me011 | OK ,"
[00:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[00:24] me011 | Yeah , it doesn't matter ."
[00:25] me011 | OK .
[00:25] me013 | OK
[00:27] me013 | Um
"[00:28] me013 | Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go , and Right ? That was that was sort of the point ."
"[00:34] me013 | So , uh"
[00:41] me011 | So we all forgot .
"[00:42] me013 | Uh ,"
[00:45] fe008 | one topic from last time .
"[00:45] me013 | Right , s"
"[00:46] me013 | OK , so one item for an agenda is uh Jane has some uh"
"[00:51] me013 | uh some research to talk about ,"
[00:53] me013 | research issues .
[00:55] me013 | Um
[00:56] me011 | And I have some short research issues .
[01:20] me018 | A list that you have to send off to who ?
[01:24] me018 | Oh .
[01:24] mn005 | @ @
"[01:27] me013 | Um ,"
"[01:30] me013 | So , uh so , I 'll go through that ."
[01:36] me013 | Anything else ?
[01:40] me013 | No . OK .
"[01:40] me018 | What about the , um your trip , yesterday ?"
[01:42] me013 | Um .
"[01:46] me018 | Oh , OK ."
"[01:52] me013 | Um ,"
"[01:54] me013 | And ,"
[01:56] me013 | Anything else ? Nothing else ?
"[01:58] me013 | Uh , there 's a I mean , there is a a , um"
[02:12] me011 | Do you want me to be there for that ?
[02:17] me011 | I didn't quite know what to make of that .
"[02:18] me013 | Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting ."
[02:21] me011 | OK .
[02:21] me013 | OK .
"[02:22] me013 | Uh , OK . So it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything ,"
"[02:35] me013 | OK , uh , Jane , since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours , make sure we get to it ."
[02:45] me011 | Is this the same as the email or different ?
[02:48] mn014 | Thanks .
[02:48] me011 | OK .
[02:51] me018 | Same idea ?
"[02:51] fe008 | But , same idea . So , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before , so Basically , um"
"[03:07] fe008 | OK , so ,"
[03:09] fe008 | It 's indicated to to so the people know
"[03:12] fe008 | which which stretches of speech were in the clear ,"
"[03:15] fe008 | versus being overlapped by others . So , I"
[03:38] fe008 | What you can see is the number of overlaps
[03:47] fe008 | what I was looking for sp sp specifically was the question of
[04:29] me013 | e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?
[04:33] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[04:36] me013 | Ah .
[04:37] mn014 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:37] fe008 | At the very end ,"
"[04:38] fe008 | this is when people were ,"
[04:50] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
[04:52] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:02] fe008 | And , again I want to emphasize this is just one particular"
"[05:32] fe008 | who else , and"
"[05:52] fe008 | And then if you look across the right ,"
[05:58] me018 | Hmm !
[05:59] fe008 | overlapped with by somebody .
[05:59] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:01] fe008 | And , then if you look down in the summary table ,"
[06:11] fe008 | Raw counts .
[06:12] me011 | So it would be interesting to see
[06:14] me011 | how much each person spoke .
[06:15] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:15] fe008 | Yes ,"
[06:16] mn005 | Yeah
[06:16] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:16] fe008 | very true very true it would be good to normalize with respect to that . Now on the table I did
"[06:29] fe008 | Of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two two - person overlap ,"
"[06:38] fe008 | And there , it looks like you see some differences ,"
"[06:47] fe008 | uh i e this is just one meeting ,"
"[06:55] me013 | S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something ."
"[07:01] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[07:03] mn005 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[07:03] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
[07:04] me013 | Yeah .
[07:04] me013 | Excuse me .
"[07:07] me013 | B I I I rather enjoyed it , but but this"
[07:08] me018 | But the numbers speak for themselves .
"[07:09] mn005 | He 's Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[07:09] me011 | Yes , that 's right , so you don't nee OK ."
[07:11] fe008 | saying on the tape who did
[07:13] me013 | Sure .
[07:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[07:21] me011 | This is actually when Jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about"
"[07:27] fe008 | Well , fair enough . Fair enough ."
[07:29] me013 | Yeah .
[07:34] me013 | Oh sure .
[07:37] fe008 | there 's also the question of what type of overlap
"[07:39] fe008 | was this , and w what were they , and"
"[07:41] fe008 | i and I and I know that I can distinguish at least three types and , probably more , I mean , the"
[08:04] fe008 | viewed as being
"[08:17] fe008 | And and ,"
"[08:33] fe008 | And and , als I mean ,"
"[08:35] fe008 | I can't say universally ,"
"[08:36] fe008 | but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict ,"
[08:44] fe008 | ack acknowledge the influence of
[08:50] fe008 | Then it beco
"[08:53] fe008 | um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , I have at the bottom several that I noticed . So ,"
"[08:58] fe008 | uh , there are backchannels , like what Adam just did now and , um"
"[09:01] fe008 | um , anticipating the end of a question"
[09:07] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[09:24] fe008 | And places also
"[09:26] fe008 | which I thought were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly th the same answer in unison different words of course but you know , the basically ,"
"[09:33] fe008 | everyone 's saying "" yes "" or you know , or"
[09:35] fe008 | ev even more sp specific than that .
"[09:37] fe008 | So , uh , the point is that , um"
"[09:51] me013 | Well , of course th the biggest , um"
[10:04] me011 | Yep .
"[10:04] fe008 | Oh , OK interesting ."
[10:05] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:05] me013 | Right ?
[10:12] me011 | Hundred ninety - seven .
"[10:25] fe008 | Well , at the bottom , you have the bottom three ."
[10:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:27] me013 | @ @
"[10:28] me013 | Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ?"
[10:28] me018 | But it w
"[10:31] fe008 | Yes , uh - huh . Yeah . But just no overlaps ."
[10:31] me013 | There was speech ?
"[10:33] me018 | It 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps ,"
"[10:36] fe008 | Yes , exactly and that 's that 's where Jose 's pro project comes in ."
"[10:37] mn005 | Yeah , yeah ,"
[10:37] mn014 | Yeah .
[10:38] me018 | Yeah .
[10:38] mn005 | I h I have this that infor I have th that information
[10:39] fe016 | Hmm .
[10:41] mn005 | now .
"[10:42] me013 | Oh , about how much is it ?"
[10:42] mn005 | The the duration of eh of each of the overlaps .
"[10:45] me013 | O oh , what 's what 's the what 's the average"
"[10:48] mn005 | M I I haven't averaged it now but , uh I I will , uh"
"[10:51] mn005 | I will do the the study of the with the with the program with the uh , the different , uh the , nnn , distribution of the duration of the overlaps ."
[10:53] me013 | You don't know ?
"[11:01] me013 | OK , you you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is ? Yeah ."
"[11:04] mn005 | mmm , Because the the uh , @ @ is @ @ ."
"[11:08] mn005 | The duration is , uh the variation the variation of the duration is uh , very big"
[11:08] me013 | Yeah .
[11:13] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:13] fe008 | I suspect that it will also differ ,"
[11:14] mn005 | on the dat
[11:16] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:17] me013 | Oh , I 'm sure ."
"[11:17] mn005 | Because , on your surface eh a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration"
"[11:24] mn005 | eh , overlapped and another very very short ."
[11:25] me013 | Yeah .
[11:27] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:28] mn005 | Uh , i probably it 's very difficult to to because the the overlap is , uh on is only the in the final "" S """
[11:36] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:06] mn005 | With eh that fricative sounds , but uh I have new information but I have to to study ."
[12:07] me013 | Yeah .
[12:14] fe008 | Yeah .
"[12:14] mn017 | You split this by minute , um so if an overlap"
[12:15] fe008 | Yes .
"[12:18] mn017 | straddles the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes ."
[12:20] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[12:28] fe008 | um actually not .
"[12:30] fe008 | Uh , so le let 's think about the case where"
[12:32] fe008 | A starts speaking
"[12:34] fe008 | and then B overlaps with A ,"
"[12:57] mn017 | No , but suppose they both"
[12:59] mn017 | talk simultaneously
[13:02] mn017 | both a a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two .
"[13:07] fe008 | OK . In that case , um"
"[13:17] fe008 | Yeah , "" yets "" is not a word ."
[13:19] fe008 | since we haven't incorporated Adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet
"[13:22] fe008 | um then that would have fallen through the cra cracks . It would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , um I wou I wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was"
"[13:33] fe008 | We just haven't done th the precise second to sec you know ,"
[13:33] me013 | I I
[13:36] me013 | I I
[13:37] me013 | I 'm I 'm I 'm confused now . So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and and see .
[13:40] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[13:43] me013 | Let 's say that in in second fifty - seven
[13:46] fe008 | Yep .
"[13:46] me013 | of one minute ,"
[13:49] fe008 | OK .
[13:50] me013 | and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds .
[13:52] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:53] me013 | So we go over So we were we were talking over one another ,"
"[13:56] me013 | in each case , it 's just sort of one interval ."
[13:59] fe008 | Mm - hmm ?
[13:59] me013 | Right ?
"[14:00] me013 | So , um we talked over the minute boundary ."
"[14:04] me013 | Is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this ."
"[14:09] fe008 | No , it wouldn't ."
[14:10] fe008 | It would be considered as an overlap in the first one .
"[14:12] me013 | OK , so that 's"
[14:14] mn017 | Yeah .
[14:15] mn014 | @ @
[14:15] me011 | Statistical .
[14:16] fe016 | Yeah .
[14:16] me011 | Yep .
[14:16] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah . They 're not double counted .
"[14:17] mn017 | Other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there ."
[14:17] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:18] fe016 | Ah but ,"
[14:19] fe016 | yeah .
[14:19] fe016 | @ @
[14:20] me013 | Yeah .
[14:20] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:28] fe008 | I I didn't count that as a three - person overlap , I counted that as a two - person overlap ,"
[14:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:35] fe008 | Because the idea was the first speaker
"[14:43] fe008 | These are simplifying assumptions , didn't happen very often , there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing ."
[14:44] fe016 | Yeah .
[14:49] me011 | I want to go back and listen to minute forty - one .
"[14:51] fe008 | Yeah , yeah ."
[14:52] me011 | Cuz i i I find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker .
[14:52] me013 | Yeah .
[14:57] me011 | I mean what I thought what I
[14:59] me011 | would have thought in
[14:59] fe008 | That 's interesting .
[15:00] fe008 | That 's interesting .
[15:03] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:04] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:04] me011 | but uh
[15:05] me011 | apparently not . That 's really neat .
[15:06] mn005 | Mmm .
"[15:10] fe016 | I think what 's really interesting though , it is"
[15:17] fe016 | find out how many more
"[15:20] fe016 | Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at"
"[15:24] fe016 | backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ?"
[15:28] fe016 | It 's just that people haven't been
[15:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:33] me013 | Mm - hmm ?
"[15:35] fe016 | So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps"
"[15:43] fe016 | to a meeting ,"
"[15:46] me013 | Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,"
[15:48] fe016 | So .
[15:49] me013 | because
[15:54] fe016 | Mm - hmm ?
[16:00] fe016 | It depends what you 're doing .
[16:01] fe016 | So if you were actually
[16:07] fe016 | Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting .
[16:10] me013 | Mm - hmm ?
"[16:11] fe016 | "" are there really more overlaps happening"
"[16:15] fe016 | than there would be in a two - person party "" ."
[16:17] me013 | let m
[16:17] me013 | let me rephrase what I 'm saying
[16:18] me013 | cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across .
"[16:20] me013 | I shouldn't use words like "" nice "" because maybe that 's too i too imprecise ."
[16:23] me013 | But what I mean is
"[16:25] me013 | that , um in Switchboard ,"
"[16:32] me013 | And what we 're doing now is ,"
"[16:42] me013 | not all of them , one of them is"
"[16:44] me013 | that w uh at least ,"
"[16:48] me013 | the scenario in which , uh"
"[16:55] me013 | And so ,"
[17:03] fe016 | I I agree that it 's an issue here
[17:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:10] fe016 | you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have"
"[17:16] fe016 | Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,"
[17:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[17:20] fe016 | so if each of us was calling and having
"[17:27] fe016 | And , just the question is ,"
[17:33] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:34] fe016 | of more than one person , and"
[17:43] fe016 | So it may be that having three people
[17:50] fe016 | So .
[17:55] me013 | Were you ?
[17:55] me011 | Though it wasn't in the design .
[17:56] fe016 | but
[17:57] me013 | Were you were you were you were you measuring it ?
[17:59] fe016 | There there 's
[18:01] fe016 | actually
"[18:02] fe016 | to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because"
[18:05] fe016 | of
"[18:06] fe016 | so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , I mean , which Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on ,"
[18:12] me013 | Yeah .
[18:12] fe016 | you want to know the sequence of turns .
"[18:15] fe016 | So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn ,"
[18:19] me013 | Yeah .
[18:19] fe016 | and then you keep going
"[18:21] fe016 | what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel ,"
[18:25] fe016 | even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .
[18:28] me013 | Yeah ?
"[18:28] fe016 | So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling"
[18:32] fe016 | We know that that 's wrong
[18:34] me013 | Yeah ?
[18:34] fe016 | in real time .
"[18:35] fe016 | But , because"
[18:37] fe016 | of
"[18:38] fe016 | the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing ,"
"[18:43] fe016 | people couldn't study it ,"
"[18:47] me013 | Yeah , I wasn't saying that ."
"[18:47] fe016 | So ,"
[18:48] me013 | Right ? I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it .
[18:49] fe016 | um
"[18:51] fe016 | Well , we 've als"
"[18:51] me013 | And and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't ."
[18:52] fe016 | Right . We 're looking at it here .
[18:58] me013 | So that 's why it 's coming to us as new
[19:05] fe016 | Um .
"[19:06] me013 | if it 's the null poth hypothesis ,"
"[19:07] me013 | and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person ,"
[19:11] me013 | we don't know the answer to that .
[19:12] me013 | The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied
[19:14] me013 | and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ?
"[19:15] fe016 | Yeah , all I meant is"
[19:16] fe016 | that
[19:17] fe016 | if you 're asking the question from the point of view of
[19:21] me013 | Mm - hmm ?
"[19:21] fe016 | studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus"
[19:26] fe016 | kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person meeting .
[19:29] fe016 | It 's important to distinguish
[19:36] fe016 | but we just couldn't study them .
[19:37] fe016 | And and so uh
[19:38] me013 | May have been . Right ?
[19:39] me013 | We do kn we don't know the numbers .
"[19:39] fe016 | Well ,"
"[19:40] fe016 | there is a high rate ,"
"[19:41] fe016 | It 's but I don't know how high ,"
[19:43] fe016 | in fact
"[19:43] me018 | Well , here"
[19:43] me018 | I have a question .
[19:44] fe016 | that would be
"[19:45] me013 | See , I mean , i i le let me t"
[19:45] fe016 | interesting to know .
"[19:46] me013 | I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , "" what have we learned about overlaps here ? """
"[19:50] me013 | just never mind comparison with something else ,"
[19:52] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[19:58] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:58] me013 | Right ?
[19:59] me013 | In in the sense that i if you said
"[20:00] fe016 | Yeah ,"
[20:00] me013 | if i i i
[20:01] fe016 | I I don't di
"[20:01] me013 | In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the"
[20:02] fe016 | I
[20:02] fe016 | agree with
[20:03] fe016 | that .
[20:03] me013 | common sense notion of
[20:05] me013 | how how much people overlap .
"[20:07] me013 | Uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time"
"[20:15] me013 | and now I look at this and I go , "" well , I can see why he was having such a hard time "" . It 's happening a lot ."
[20:17] fe016 | Right .
[20:18] fe016 | That 's also true of Switchboard .
[20:19] me013 | I wasn't saying it wasn't .
"[20:20] fe016 | Right . So it 's just ,"
[20:21] me013 | Right ?
[20:22] fe016 | um
[20:23] fe016 | OK .
[20:24] fe016 | All I 'm saying is that from the
"[20:27] me013 | and we sh which , you know we 're gonna get"
"[20:29] me013 | much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data ,"
"[20:32] me013 | But Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn"
[20:42] me013 | bunch of overlaps second - order thing is
"[20:44] me013 | it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point ,"
[20:47] me011 | Right .
"[20:47] me013 | but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing ."
[20:49] me013 | And that 's interesting . That 's all .
[20:49] fe016 | Right .
"[20:50] fe016 | No , I I agree with that ."
[20:51] fe016 | I 'm just
[20:57] me013 | Oh yeah .
[20:58] me013 | Yeah .
[20:59] fe016 | And
"[20:59] me013 | Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that ."
[21:00] fe016 | that 's all .
[21:00] fe016 | And and it would actually be interesting to find out because
[21:01] me013 | Yeah .
[21:04] fe016 | some of the
"[21:05] fe016 | data say Switchboard , which isn't exactly the same kind of context , I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth ,"
[21:11] fe016 | But we should still be able to
[21:13] fe016 | somehow
[21:15] fe016 | say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap
[21:19] fe016 | time
"[21:21] fe016 | of each additional person , or something like that ."
[21:22] me011 | Yep . I could certainly see it going either way .
[21:25] fe016 | But yeah .
[21:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[21:32] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:32] fe016 | Right .
"[21:34] fe008 | you know , as adults . I mean , children don't adjust so well ,"
"[21:38] fe008 | goes rolling past ,"
[21:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:47] fe008 | monitor things like that ,"
[21:48] fe016 | Right .
"[21:54] fe008 | Yeah , this is d also um ,"
"[22:03] fe008 | uh , ambient thing ."
[22:03] fe016 | Right .
"[22:05] fe008 | and , just to finish this ,"
[22:06] fe008 | that um
[22:07] fe008 | That I think that
"[22:08] fe008 | there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have , simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already"
[22:15] fe008 | fray .
"[22:16] fe008 | But I you know ,"
[22:17] fe008 | of certain types .
[22:19] fe008 | people
[22:27] fe008 | there may be no upper bound on those .
"[22:29] mn017 | I I have a feeling that backchannels , which are"
"[22:32] mn017 | the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard ,"
"[22:42] mn017 | you know , in a multi - person"
"[22:43] fe016 | If you can see them , actually ."
[22:43] mn017 | audience .
[22:46] mn017 | Right .
[22:47] mn005 | Yeah .
"[22:47] fe016 | Right right , like this here , but"
[22:50] me013 | u
[22:50] fe016 | That may not be the case if you couldn't see them .
"[22:54] mn017 | it 's unusual to have everybody going "" uh - huh , uh - huh """
"[22:57] me013 | Actually , I think I 've done it"
[23:00] fe016 | Yeah .
"[23:01] fe016 | There 's a lot of head - nodding ,"
[23:01] me011 | Um .
[23:02] fe016 | in this
[23:02] mn017 | Yeah .
[23:03] fe016 | @ @
"[23:03] me011 | Yep , we need to put trackers on it ."
"[23:07] fe008 | He could , he could ."
"[23:11] mn017 | That 's in part because the nodding , if you have visual contact ,"
"[23:18] me011 | Yeah , you don't have it ."
[23:20] mn017 | so you need to use the backchannel .
"[23:23] me018 | So , in the two - person conversations ,"
[23:26] me018 | is there a great deal of
"[23:27] me011 | That is an earphone , so if you just put it so it 's on your ear ."
[23:31] fe016 | Yes .
[23:31] me011 | There you go .
[23:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[23:32] me011 | Thank you .
[23:33] fe008 | E for example .
"[23:33] me018 | it happens when there 's a pause ,"
"[23:35] me018 | you know , like you you"
[23:35] fe016 | Yes .
"[23:36] me018 | get a lot of backchannel , when somebody 's pausing"
[23:37] fe016 | Right .
[23:39] fe008 | She 's doing that .
"[23:42] me018 | It 's hard to do both , huh ?"
[23:45] fe016 | Oh .
"[23:49] me018 | and when there 's two people talking and there 's backchannel it seems like ,"
[24:02] me018 | h
[24:02] me018 | I just wonder how much overlap there is .
[24:04] me018 | Is there a lot ?
"[24:08] fe016 | I mean , this is called "" precision timing "" in conversation analysis ,"
[24:11] fe016 | where
"[24:13] fe016 | overlapping ,"
[24:17] fe016 | information is mostly
[24:19] fe016 | So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words .
[24:22] me018 | Mmm .
[24:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:28] fe016 | But
[24:28] me018 | But maybe a just a small overlap ?
"[24:29] mn005 | More , yeah ."
[24:33] me011 | It 'd be interesting if we could do prediction .
"[24:33] me018 | I was just thinking more in terms of alignment ,"
[24:35] me018 | alignment overlap .
[24:36] fe016 | Yeah .
"[24:36] me011 | Language model prediction of overlap , that would be really interesting ."
[24:39] me013 | Yeah .
"[24:40] fe016 | Well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in"
[24:43] mn017 | Right .
[24:44] me011 | Right .
"[24:46] fe016 | uh Switchboard , say , because there 's a lot of that ."
"[24:51] mn017 | Uh , to distinguish between , say , backchannels"
[24:51] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[24:54] mn017 | precision timing Sort of
"[24:56] mn017 | you know , benevolent overlaps ,"
[24:59] me011 | Let 's pick a different word .
"[25:00] mn017 | and sort of , um I don't know , hostile overlaps , where"
[25:03] mn017 | someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else .
[25:05] mn005 | Yeah .
"[25:06] mn017 | Uh , that that might be an interesting , um problem to look at ."
[25:09] mn005 | Yeah .
[25:09] me018 | Hostile takeovers .
[25:09] mn005 | Yeah .
[25:09] me013 | Yeah .
"[25:10] fe008 | Well , I mean you could do that . I ju I I think that"
[25:10] mn005 | Yeah .
[25:16] mn017 | OK .
[25:17] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:20] mn017 | Um , I could imagine that as there 's a fair number of"
[25:23] mn017 | um
"[25:24] mn017 | cases where ,"
[25:29] mn017 | one person is finishing something and
[25:37] me013 | Yeah .
[25:38] mn017 | And so it 's not against the person who talks first
[25:52] me013 | are are competitive as opposed to real really really hostile . But .
[25:54] mn017 | Right .
"[25:54] fe008 | Yeah , I agree . I agree ."
[25:55] me018 | I wonder what determines who gets the floor ?
[25:58] me013 | Uh a vote vote in Florida . Yeah .
[25:58] me011 | It 's been studied a lot .
[26:04] me013 | or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in . But . But .
[26:09] me013 | Um .
"[26:14] me013 | all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u"
[26:19] me013 | @ @
"[26:20] me013 | So , um I wonder if what you 're saying"
"[26:24] me013 | suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have ,"
[26:26] me013 | um
[26:28] me013 | a a fair number of meetings
"[26:30] me013 | with , uh"
[26:32] me013 | a smaller number of people .
[26:33] me013 | Right ?
[26:34] me013 | I mean
[26:34] me013 | we most of our meetings are
[26:40] me013 | Should we
[26:46] me013 | just to to to
[26:48] me013 | beef up the the statistics on that ?
[26:48] fe008 | That 's a control .
"[26:51] fe008 | Well ,"
"[26:52] fe008 | it seems like there are two possibilities there , I mean"
"[26:59] fe008 | y like a meeting , w"
[27:08] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:11] me013 | Well , Liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there ,"
[27:17] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:18] me013 | and , um"
[27:20] me013 | If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals . You wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the
"[27:27] me013 | say , in Switchboard data ."
[27:28] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[27:29] me013 | Uh
"[27:29] fe008 | Yeah , I 'm just thinking that 'd be more like a c control condition ."
[27:31] me013 | Yeah .
[27:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:32] me011 | Well , but from the acoustic point of view ,"
[27:32] mn005 | Yeah .
[27:34] me011 | it 's all good .
[27:34] mn005 | Is the same .
[27:39] mn017 | you could serve yourself save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri transcribe the words .
[27:46] me011 | Yep .
"[27:46] fe016 | Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this"
"[27:48] fe016 | from the acoustics , on the close - talking mikes , right ?"
[27:51] me013 | Yeah .
[27:51] fe008 | You 've been working on that .
[27:53] mn005 | Yeah .
[27:54] me013 | Yeah .
[27:58] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[27:59] fe016 | you 'd get some rough statistics .
[28:01] fe016 | So .
[28:02] me013 | what what do you think about that ?
"[28:06] fe016 | I guess my my first comment was , um only that"
[28:10] fe016 | um
"[28:13] fe016 | we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings , but maybe that 's obvious , maybe"
"[28:18] fe016 | everybody knew that , but that"
[28:18] me013 | Yeah .
[28:20] fe016 | in normal
"[28:22] fe016 | conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap , and that it would be interesting"
[28:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[28:29] fe016 | to
"[28:30] fe016 | look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that"
"[28:35] fe016 | what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,"
"[28:40] fe016 | you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn , but pretty quickly"
[28:44] fe016 | there 're they back off and you go back to this sort of
[28:46] fe016 | only one person at a time with one person
[28:48] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[28:48] fe016 | interrupting at a time .
"[28:50] fe016 | So , I don't know . To answer your question I it I don't think it 's"
[28:54] fe016 | crucial to have
[28:59] fe016 | can .
"[29:00] me013 | Well , OK ."
[29:00] mn005 | Yeah .
[29:01] mn017 | I I have an idea .
[29:02] fe016 | you know .
[29:03] fe016 | D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people .
[29:05] me011 | Right .
[29:09] mn017 | we have have in the past and I think continue will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls .
[29:15] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[29:18] mn017 | uh ,"
"[29:20] mn017 | to , um"
"[29:22] mn017 | as another c c comparison condition , we could"
[29:26] mn017 | um
[29:27] mn017 | see what what
"[29:29] mn017 | what happens in terms of overlap , when you don't have visual contact ."
[29:33] fe016 | Can we actually record ?
[29:34] me011 | It just seems like that 's a very different thing than what we 're doing .
[29:35] me013 | Uh
"[29:37] me013 | Well , we 'll have to set up for it ."
[29:38] me013 | Yeah .
"[29:39] me013 | Well , we 're not really set up for it"
[29:41] me013 | But .
"[29:42] mn017 | Or ,"
[29:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[29:43] mn017 | this is getting a little extravagant ,"
[29:45] mn017 | we could put up
[29:46] mn017 | some kind of
[29:48] mn014 | Yeah .
"[29:49] fe016 | That 's what they did on Map Task ,"
"[29:51] fe016 | you know , this Map Task corpus ?"
[29:52] fe016 | They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without
[29:55] fe016 | visual cues and it 's quite interesting .
[30:03] me013 | I mean a little strange .
"[30:03] me011 | OK , we can record , but no one can look at each other ."
"[30:05] fe016 | Well , we could just put b blindfolds on ."
[30:06] mn014 | Yeah .
[30:06] me011 | Close your eyes .
"[30:06] mn017 | Well y no you f Yeah , Yeah ."
[30:07] fe008 | Blindf -
[30:07] me011 | Turn off the lights .
[30:09] fe016 | and we 'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds .
"[30:12] me013 | Oh , th that was the other thing , weren't we gonna take a picture"
"[30:17] me011 | Um , what I had"
[30:19] me011 | thought we were gonna do is just take pictures of the whiteboards .
[30:22] me011 | rather than take pictures of the meeting .
[30:25] fe008 | Yeah .
[30:25] fe008 | Linguistic anthropologists would would suggest it would be useful to
[30:30] fe008 | also take a picture of the meeting .
[30:31] me018 | Why why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ?
[30:33] fe008 | because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers .
[30:36] mn005 | Yeah
[30:36] mn005 | Yeah .
[30:37] mn005 | Yeah .
"[30:38] me011 | Seat number , that 's a good idea ."
[30:39] me011 | I 'll do that . I 'll do that on the next set of forms .
[30:40] mn005 | Yeah .
[30:41] mn017 | So you 'd number them somehow .
"[30:41] mn005 | Yeah . Is possible to get information from the rhythmic f from the ge , eh uh , files ."
"[30:44] me011 | I finally remembered to put , uh"
[30:47] me018 | We can can't you figure it out from the mike number ?
[30:47] me011 | put native language on the newer forms .
[30:51] me011 | No .
[30:51] me018 | OK .
[30:52] me011 | The wireless ones .
"[30:55] me011 | And even the jacks , I mean , I 'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you ."
[30:58] me018 | Oh .
[30:59] fe016 | But probably from these you could 've infer it .
"[31:01] mn017 | Yeah , but"
[31:02] me011 | It would be another task .
[31:02] fe016 | It would be a research task .
"[31:03] me011 | Having having ground tu truth would be nice , so seat number would be good ."
[31:05] me018 | You know where you could get it ?
"[31:05] fe016 | Yeah , yeah ."
[31:06] mn005 | Yeah .
[31:06] me018 | Beam - forming during the digit uh stuff .
[31:09] me011 | So I 'm gonna put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number . That 's a good idea .
[31:10] mn014 | Mm - hmm .
[31:13] fe016 | But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla like here .
[31:14] mn017 | Chairs are movable .
[31:16] me011 | Yep .
[31:16] mn014 | Yeah .
[31:17] me011 | Yep .
[31:18] mn005 | Yeah .
"[31:18] fe008 | But you know , they the s"
"[31:20] fe008 | the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway , because you get"
[31:21] me018 | Just remembered a joke .
[31:25] mn017 | What people were wearing .
[31:25] me011 | Yeah .
"[31:25] fe008 | Posture , and we could like ,"
[31:28] fe016 | The fashion statement .
[31:32] me013 | But if you just f
[31:32] mn017 | Yeah .
[31:33] mn017 | Andreas was wearing that same old sweater again .
"[31:34] me013 | But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that . Right ?"
"[31:36] me013 | You 'd want a video for that , I think ."
"[31:38] mn005 | A video , yeah ."
[31:39] fe008 | i Just from a single picture I think you can tell some aspects .
[31:40] me013 | Think so ?
"[31:41] fe008 | I mean I I could tell you I mean , if I if I 'm in certain meetings I notice that there are certain people who"
[31:49] me013 | Hmm .
[31:49] fe008 | is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect .
[31:51] mn017 | Yeah .
[31:51] mn017 | And and
[31:52] mn017 | Morgan had that funny hair again .
"[31:54] fe008 | Well , I mean you black out the that part . But it 's just , you know , the the body"
[31:54] me011 | Hmm .
[31:58] fe008 | you know ?
"[32:00] me011 | Of course , the where we sit at the table , I find is very interesting , that we do tend to cong to"
[32:04] me011 | gravitate to the same place each time .
[32:06] fe008 | Yeah .
[32:07] me011 | and it 's somewhat coincidental . I 'm sitting here so that I can
"[32:10] me011 | run into the room if the hardware starts , you know , catching fire or something ."
[32:15] me011 | I just want to be at the head of the table .
[32:16] mn017 | Yeah .
[32:17] me011 | Take control .
"[32:18] me013 | Speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about ."
[32:20] fe008 | Yeah .
"[32:20] me011 | Yeah , I 've been playing with , um"
[32:21] fe008 | Yeah .
"[32:23] me011 | uh , using the close - talking mike to do to try to figure out who 's speaking ."
"[32:26] me011 | So my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering , that we talked about about two weeks ago ,"
"[32:31] me011 | and so I played with that a little bit , and"
"[32:34] me011 | it works O K , except that"
[32:38] me011 | your filter width and your
[32:41] me011 | threshold .
[32:42] me011 | So if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone 's talking and when they 're not .
"[32:48] me011 | But if you try to use the same paramenters on another speaker , it doesn't work anymore , even if you normalize it based on"
[32:54] me011 | the absolute loudness .
[32:55] fe016 | But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ?
[32:58] me011 | It does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .
[33:01] me011 | Um
[33:02] me011 | Pretty well . Pretty well .
[33:02] me018 | How did you do it Adam ?
[33:04] me011 | How did I do it ? What do you mean ?
[33:04] me018 | Yeah .
"[33:06] me011 | The algorithm was , uh"
[33:07] me018 | Yeah .
[33:09] me011 | take
"[33:09] me011 | o every frame that 's over the threshold ,"
"[33:11] me011 | and then median - filter it ,"
[33:13] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[33:13] me011 | and then look for runs .
[33:18] me018 | Every frame that 's over what threshold ?
[33:20] me011 | A threshold that you pick .
[33:21] me018 | In terms of energy ?
[33:22] me011 | Yeah .
[33:22] me018 | Ah !
[33:23] me018 | OK .
[33:24] fe008 | Say that again ?
[33:24] fe008 | Frame over fres threshold .
"[33:25] me011 | So you take a each frame , and you compute the energy and if it 's over the threshold you set it to one , and if it 's under the threshold you set it to zero ,"
[33:32] fe008 | Hmm .
[33:32] me011 | so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones .
[33:33] fe008 | OK .
[33:34] me011 | And then I median - filtered that
"[33:37] me011 | using , um a fairly long filter length ."
"[33:40] me011 | Uh well , actually I guess depends on what you mean by long , you know , tenth of a second sorts of numbers ."
[33:45] me011 | Um
[33:46] me011 | and that 's to average out
"[33:48] me011 | you know , pitch ,"
"[33:49] me011 | you know , the pitch contours ,"
[33:51] me011 | and things like that .
"[33:52] me011 | And then , uh"
[33:53] me011 | looked for long runs .
[33:55] fe008 | OK
"[33:58] me011 | And that works O K , if you fil if you tune the filter parameters , if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you 're looking for your thresholds ."
[34:07] me018 | Did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ?
[34:11] me011 | No .
[34:12] me011 | I certainly could though .
[34:14] me011 | But this was just
"[34:19] me011 | OK and then the other thing I did , was I took"
"[34:21] me011 | Javier 's speaker - change detector acoustic - change detector , and I implemented that with the close - talking mikes ,"
"[34:33] me011 | the problem is he does it in two passes , the first pass"
[34:39] me011 | And he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he
[34:43] me011 | has the
"[34:45] me011 | the , uh one of the phone classes is silence ."
[34:48] me011 | And so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends .
[34:55] me011 | Um
[34:56] me011 | looking for
[34:57] me011 | uh
[34:58] me011 | whether it improves or or degrades to split at one of those particular places .
[35:06] me011 | even on the close - talking mike
[35:09] me011 | the broad phone class classifier 's doing a really bad job .
[35:12] me018 | Who was it trained on ?
"[35:13] me011 | Uh , I have no idea . I don't remember ."
[35:14] me018 | Hmm .
"[35:16] me011 | Does an do you remember , Morgan , was it Broadcast News ?"
"[35:18] me013 | I think so , yeah ."
"[35:20] me011 | So , at any rate , my next attempt , which I 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the"
"[35:27] me011 | uh , thresholding"
[35:28] me011 | as the way of generating the candidates .
[35:31] me011 | Because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks .
[35:35] me011 | All of which are definitely acoustic events .
[35:38] me011 | They 're definitely
[35:40] me011 | someone talking .
"[35:41] me011 | But , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing ."
[35:50] me011 | And so I think that might work .
"[35:52] me011 | But , I haven't gotten very far on that ."
"[35:55] me011 | But all of this is close - talking mike , so"
"[36:01] mn005 | uh , but eh"
"[36:03] mn005 | I I I think , eh"
"[36:05] mn005 | when when , y I I saw the the the the speech from PDA and , eh close talker . I I think the"
[36:13] mn005 | there is a a great difference in the in the signal .
"[36:16] me011 | Oh , absolutely . So s my intention for this is is as an aide for ground truth ."
[36:21] mn005 | but eh
[36:22] mn005 | I I I mean that eh eh in the in the mixed file
"[36:29] mn005 | great different , eh level of energy ."
"[36:34] mn005 | I I think for , eh algorithm based on energy ,"
"[36:43] mn005 | eh , mmm , first sound energy detector ."
[36:47] me011 | Say it again ?
[36:47] mn005 | eh nnn .
[36:48] mn005 | When y you the detect the the the first at at the end of of the
"[36:53] mn005 | detector of , ehm princ um . What is the the name in English ? the the , mmm ,"
[37:04] mn005 | an isolated word
[37:05] mn005 | in in the background
"[37:07] mn005 | That , uh"
"[37:08] mn005 | I mean that when when you use , eh eh any"
[37:11] me018 | I think he 's saying the onset detector .
[37:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[37:14] me011 | Onset detector , OK ."
"[37:15] mn005 | I I think it 's probably to work well eh , because , eh you have eh , in the mixed files a great level of energy ."
[37:26] mn005 | And probably is not so easy
[37:30] me011 | Right .
"[37:35] mn005 | in in that , eh eh speech file is , eh more similar ."
[37:39] me011 | Right .
[37:40] me011 | But different speakers .
"[37:42] mn005 | I I think is eh , it will i is my opinion . It will be , eh more difficult to to detect"
[37:49] mn005 | bass - tone energy .
"[37:52] mn005 | I think that , um In the PDA . Yeah . Yeah . And the the another question , that when"
"[37:53] me011 | Ah , in the clo in the P D A , you mean ? Absolutely . Yeah , no question . It 'll be much harder . Much harder ."
[37:57] me013 | Yeah .
"[38:00] mn005 | I review the the the work of Javier . I think the , nnn , the , nnn , that the idea of using a neural network"
"[38:09] mn005 | to to get a broad class of phonetic , eh from , eh uh"
[38:14] mn005 | a candidate from the the the speech signal .
"[38:20] mn005 | uh , I 'm considering , only because Javier , eh only consider , eh like candidate , the , nnn , eh the silence , because it is the the only model , eh eh , he used that , eh eh nnn ,"
[38:29] me011 | Right .
[38:33] mn005 | to detect
[38:46] mn005 | to consider hypothesis
[38:51] mn005 | eh between each phoneme .
[38:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:54] me011 | Yeah , when a phone changes ."
"[38:55] mn005 | Because , I I I think it 's more realistic that , uh only consider the the the the silence between the speaker . Eh there there exists"
"[39:12] mn005 | event , important to to consider ."
[39:12] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[39:14] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:14] mn005 | I I found that the , eh silence in in many occasions in the in the speech file , but , eh when you have , eh eh , two speakers together"
[39:29] mn005 | I think
[39:30] mn005 | eh is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and I I I
"[39:36] mn005 | IX or , mmm , BIC criterion for consider all the frames"
[39:40] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[39:42] mn005 | in my opinion .
"[39:48] me013 | was not because he thought it was better ,"
[39:50] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:50] me013 | it was it was it was the place he was starting .
[39:52] me011 | Yep .
[39:53] mn005 | Yeah .
"[39:54] mn005 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[39:59] mn005 | Yeah .
"[40:00] me013 | pick a realistic goal ,"
[40:00] me011 | Do something .
"[40:00] mn005 | Yeah ,"
"[40:01] mn005 | yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[40:07] mn005 | Uh - huh .
"[40:07] mn005 | But , eh do do you think that if you consider all the frames"
[40:12] mn005 | to apply
[40:14] mn005 | the
[40:15] mn005 | BIC criterion
"[40:16] mn005 | to detect the the the different acoustic change , eh between speaker , without , uh with , uh silence or with overlapping , uh , I think like like , eh eh"
[40:31] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:31] mn005 | In a first step , I mean ."
[40:33] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:36] mn005 | eh without considering the you you you , um you can consider the energy"
"[40:40] mn005 | like a another parameter in the in the feature vector , eh ."
[40:43] me011 | Right . Absolutely .
[40:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:44] mn005 | This this is the idea . And if , if you do that , eh eh , with a BIC uh criterion for example , or with another kind of , eh of distance in a first step , and then you , eh you get the , eh the hypothesis"
[41:02] me011 | Right .
"[41:03] mn005 | Because , eh eh , probably you you can find the the"
[41:13] mn005 | small duration
[41:15] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:15] mn005 | Less than , eh two hundred milliseconds for example and apply another another algorithm , another approach like , eh eh detector of ene , eh detector of bass - tone energy to to consider that , eh"
"[41:29] mn005 | that , eh zone ."
"[41:30] mn005 | of s a small silence between speaker , or"
"[41:35] mn005 | another algorithm to to process , eh the the segment between marks"
[41:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[41:40] mn005 | eh founded by the the
[41:45] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:47] mn005 | nnn ,"
[41:47] mn005 | it will be a an an a more general approach
"[41:51] mn005 | the if we compare with use , eh a neural net or another , eh speech recognizer with a broad class or or narrow class , because , in my opinion"
"[42:03] mn005 | eh it 's in my opinion , eh"
[42:03] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:05] mn005 | if you if you change
"[42:06] mn005 | the condition of the speech , I mean , if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to , eh"
[42:09] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:20] mn005 | the neural net , eh used by Javier with a mixed file ."
[42:24] me011 | With the what file ?
[42:24] mn005 | uh
"[42:25] mn005 | With a m mixed file ,"
"[42:26] mn005 | with a the mix ,"
"[42:26] fe008 | "" Mixed . """
"[42:26] me018 | "" Mixed "" ."
"[42:27] me011 | "" Mixed ? """
[42:27] mn005 | mix . Sorry .
[42:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:29] mn005 | And
[42:40] mn005 | I think
"[42:42] me011 | Oh , absolutely . This is this is not what I was suggesting to do ."
[42:44] me013 | I u
[42:47] mn005 | to retrain it .
[42:49] mn005 | Really ?
"[42:51] me013 | It 's a I used to work , like , on voiced on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this kind of thing ."
[42:54] mn005 | Yeah .
[42:56] me013 | If you
[43:02] me013 | they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily .
[43:09] me013 | Then it gets really hard no matter what you do .
"[43:11] me013 | So , the p the problem is is that if you say , "" Well"
"[43:15] me013 | I have these other data over here ,"
[43:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:23] me013 | Uh
"[43:25] me013 | looked for acoustic change . Well , what does that mean ?"
"[43:28] me013 | That that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something , right ?"
[43:28] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[43:31] me013 | and and so where do you get your thresholds from ?
[43:34] me013 | From something that you looked at . So
[43:39] me013 | H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ?
"[43:44] me013 | Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ?"
"[43:48] me011 | Well , also what I 'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far - field mikes . What I 'm doing"
[43:48] me013 | with this .
[43:54] me011 | is trying to use the close - talking mike
[43:58] me018 | You have candidates .
[44:00] mn005 | the candidate .
[44:03] me018 | to make marking easier .
[44:04] me018 | Yeah .
[44:06] mn017 | OK .
[44:11] mn017 | I can imagine uh building a um
[44:18] mn017 | takes into account both the far - field and the
[44:22] me011 | Yep .
"[44:22] mn017 | uh actually , not just the close - talking mike for that speaker , but actually for all of th"
[44:25] me011 | Everyone else .
[44:27] me013 | Yeah .
[44:38] mn017 | basically I think you 'd you would
[44:41] mn017 | an HMM that has
[44:42] mn017 | as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations
[44:44] me011 | All the Yep .
[44:45] mn005 | Yeah .
"[44:46] mn017 | and , um"
[44:48] me011 | It 's a little big .
"[44:50] mn017 | It 's not that big actually , um"
[44:51] me011 | Two to the N .
"[44:56] me013 | Actually , Andreas may maybe maybe just something simpler but but"
[44:56] me011 | Anyway .
[44:57] mn005 | Yeah .
"[44:59] me013 | along the lines of what you 're saying , I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh"
[45:00] mn017 | Mmm .
"[45:02] me013 | um , mike mixers automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain ,"
[45:04] mn017 | Mmm .
[45:04] mn005 | Yeah .
"[45:07] me013 | you know , uh"
[45:07] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:09] me013 | you you lower the gain on on the mikes of people who aren't talking , right ?"
[45:12] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:16] me013 | uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones ."
[45:25] me011 | I was thinking about doing that originally to find out
[45:30] me013 | Yeah .
"[45:30] me011 | But I also wanted to find threshold uh , excuse me , mol overlap ."
[45:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[45:35] me011 | So , not just just the loudest ."
[45:36] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:36] mn005 | But , eh"
[45:38] mn005 | Sorry . I I have found that when when I
"[45:39] mn017 | Sorry , I have to go ."
[45:40] me011 | OK .
"[45:41] mn005 | I analyzed the the speech files from the , eh mike , eh from the eh close eh microphone , eh I found zones"
[45:43] me011 | Could you fill that out anyway ?
[45:47] me011 | Are y you want me to do it ? I 'll do it .
[45:49] me018 | But he 's not gonna even read that .
[45:50] me011 | I know .
[45:50] me018 | Oh .
[45:51] mn005 | with a a different level of energy .
[45:54] mn005 | including overlap zone .
[45:56] mn005 | including .
"[45:57] mn005 | because , eh eh depend on the position of the of the microph of the each speaker to , eh , to get"
[46:06] mn005 | more o or less energy
[46:08] mn005 | i in the mixed sign in the signal .
"[46:11] mn005 | and then , if you consider energy to to detect overlapping"
"[46:15] mn005 | in in , uh , and you process the the in the the the speech file from the the the mixed signals . The mixed signals , eh ."
"[46:25] mn005 | I I think it 's it 's difficult , um only to en with energy to to consider that in that zone"
"[46:32] mn005 | We have eh , eh , overlapping zone"
"[46:35] mn005 | Eh , if you process only the the energy of the , of each frame ."
"[46:39] me013 | Well , it 's probably harder , but I I think what I was s"
[46:42] me013 | nnn
[46:42] me013 | noting
"[46:42] me013 | just when he when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all"
[46:50] mn005 | Yeah .
[46:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[46:56] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:58] me013 | if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and and the rest of them are low , you know , what I mean , there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures ."
[47:01] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:01] me011 | And everyone else is low , yeah ."
[47:01] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:02] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:04] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:06] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:13] me011 | Ding , ding , ding , ding ."
[47:14] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:15] fe016 | I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds ."
"[47:19] me011 | Nodding with blindfolds , "" what are you nodding about ? """
"[47:22] me011 | "" Sorry , I 'm just I 'm just going to sleep . """
[47:28] me013 | Yeah .
"[47:28] me018 | Actually , I saw a uh a woman at the bus stop the other day who , um , was talking on her cell phone"
"[47:33] me018 | speaking Japanese , and was bowing ."
"[47:35] fe016 | Oh , yeah , that 's really common ."
[47:35] mn014 | Yeah .
[47:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:36] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:37] me013 | Wow .
"[47:38] fe016 | It 's very difficult if you try while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands ."
[47:45] me013 | Mm - hmm ?
"[47:45] fe016 | You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things . So ."
"[47:48] fe016 | I still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds , at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of"
[47:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:54] me013 | Yeah , I think th"
"[47:54] fe016 | Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting ."
[47:57] me013 | I think it 's a great idea .
[47:58] fe016 | That could be fun .
"[47:59] fe016 | It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way"
[47:59] me013 | W
[48:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[48:03] fe016 | you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here ."
"[48:04] me011 | Well , we could just turn out the lights ."
[48:09] fe008 | the stuff I was doing with Collin wha
[48:09] fe016 | Y Yeah ?
"[48:17] fe008 | you know , pretty l large partitions ."
[48:18] me013 | Yeah .
"[48:18] fe016 | But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking , so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb"
[48:23] me011 | The acoustics .
[48:26] me013 | Blindfolds would be good .
"[48:26] me011 | I think , blindfolds ."
"[48:27] me013 | Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes ,"
[48:29] me013 | But .
"[48:31] fe016 | it 's cheap and , uh"
[48:33] fe008 | OK .
[48:37] me018 | I 'll be peeking .
"[48:39] me011 | Yeah , that 's right , we didn't tell them we would be blindfolding ."
[48:45] me013 | So .
"[48:47] me013 | Um , I I wanna move this along ."
"[48:49] me013 | I did have this other agenda item which is , uh @ @ it 's uh a list which I sent to uh a couple folks ,"
"[48:54] me013 | but um I wanted to get broader input on it ,"
[48:56] me013 | So this is the things that I think we did
[48:59] me013 | in the last three months
[49:08] me013 | Um in no particular order
"[49:11] me013 | uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded ,"
"[49:14] me013 | something like that ,"
[49:17] me013 | three months ago .
[49:18] me013 | XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out
"[49:23] me013 | Um ,"
"[49:24] me013 | pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription ,"
"[49:28] me013 | uh next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM ,"
[49:34] me013 | But
"[49:34] me013 | yeah , that 's why I phrased it that way ,"
[49:34] me011 | It 's getting ready .
"[49:38] me013 | human subjects approval on campus ,"
[49:39] me013 | uh and release forms worked out so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of
[49:45] me013 | selected parts of the spee their speech .
[49:48] me013 | Um
"[49:54] me013 | preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed ,"
[50:08] me013 | that you and and Lokendra did .
[50:10] fe008 | What was that called ?
"[50:11] me013 | I well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences"
[50:17] me013 | for topic coherence .
[50:19] me013 | Something like that .
"[50:27] me013 | what what you two were doing so I I sent it to you , and"
[50:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[50:36] me013 | but
"[50:36] me013 | you know , just"
[50:37] me013 | im improve it .
[50:38] me013 | Um
[50:38] me011 | I I did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits .
"[50:42] me013 | "" Bunch of stuff for s "" OK , maybe maybe send me a sentence that 's a little thought through about that ."
"[50:44] me011 | So , OK , I 'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say "" a bunch of "" ?"
"[50:47] me013 | "" Bunch of stuff "" , yeah ,"
[50:48] me011 | Yep .
"[50:48] me013 | "" stuff "" is probably bad too ,"
"[50:49] me011 | "" Stuff "" is not very technical ."
[50:52] me013 | Yeah .
"[50:52] me013 | Yeah , yeah ,"
[50:53] me018 | Technical stuff .
"[50:54] me013 | "" range of things "" ,"
[50:55] me013 | yeah .
"[50:57] me013 | and and you know , I sort of"
[50:59] me013 | threw in
[51:03] me013 | uh
[51:04] me013 | preliminary analysis of overlaps .
[51:06] me013 | Uh
[51:06] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:07] me013 | uh
[51:14] mn014 | Not really .
[51:15] me018 | It 's too complicated .
"[51:16] mn014 | Um , I didn't get it . Wh - what is "" audio pixelization "" ?"
"[51:19] me013 | Uh , audio pix wh he did it , so why don't you explain it quickly ?"
"[51:21] me011 | It 's just , uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting so , you know"
"[51:26] me011 | you can say things like , "" Well , this should probably not be on the record , but beep """
"[51:30] mn014 | OK , OK ."
[51:32] mn014 | I got that .
[51:33] me013 | Yeah . We we we spent a a a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e
[51:35] mn014 | @ @
[51:43] mn014 | OK .
"[51:44] me013 | how do you get around that so in the consent form it says , well"
[51:47] me013 | we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're
[51:51] me013 | But you don't want to just totally excise it because
[51:54] me013 | um
"[51:56] me013 | uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how how you excise it keeping the timing right and so forth so that at the moment"
[52:01] me013 | tho th the idea we 're running with is is h putting the beep over it .
"[52:06] me011 | Yeah , you can either beep or it can be silence . I I couldn't decide ."

[52:26] me018 | Yeah .

[00:00] fe068 | We have littler heads so .
"[00:04] fe008 | OK . So , everything 's Oh , the microphone adjustments , we should check Would you check the microphone adjustments , please ?"
"[00:09] fe008 | Is is M So , is is Marisa 's close enough ?"
[00:10] me011 | Everyone just talk .
[00:12] fe069 | I 'm Yes .
[00:12] me070 | Hmm ?
"[00:13] fe008 | But , I mean , also , to get the do you you what you said about is i is it close ?"
[00:14] me011 | It doesn't really matter .
[00:16] me011 | OK . Thanks .
[00:16] fe008 | OK . Alright .
[00:16] fe066 | Hello .
[00:17] fe067 | Hello ?
[00:18] fe069 | I can change it . I was just trying a new head position .
[00:18] me070 | Hmm .
"[00:21] me011 | Hmm . And so , about a thumb and a half , maybe two thumb widths away from your mouth . So that 's a little far . And then , right near the corner ."
[00:21] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[00:24] fe008 | Yeah .
[00:26] fe067 | Hmm .
[00:27] fe066 | Oh .
"[00:29] me011 | "" Thumb "" , as in this way ."
[00:31] me011 | @ @ Just just So it should be right about there .
[00:33] me070 | OK . I see .
[00:34] fe067 | Hello ? OK .
"[00:34] me011 | And then you can look on the screen , and if you see breath noise , in other words , when you 're breathing , if you see it going up and down a lot , then move it a little further away from from your nose ."
[00:45] fe068 | Hmm .
[00:48] fe066 | Hello . That 's good .
[00:52] me011 | OK . @ @
[00:53] me070 | Hello . OK . Mine 's good .
[00:54] fe069 | OK .
[00:54] fe067 | Hello ?
"[00:59] fe008 | So . Uh , welcome back . Thank you for coming ."
"[01:09] fe008 | some ideas about , um ,"
"[01:13] fe008 | well , i the return to the conventions , but I also wanted to ,"
"[01:16] fe008 | uh , share with you a couple of the"
"[01:19] fe008 | things that I 've picked up in terms of checking . And these are uh , th these are things that came up with the tra with the Tigerfish transcripts . I 'm just doing this cuz I think it 's interesting ."
"[01:27] fe008 | OK . So , um ,"
"[01:40] fe008 | um ,"
[01:42] fe008 | u
"[01:42] fe008 | Leah Leah noticed this one where I said something and , um , the"
"[01:47] fe008 | transcriber interpreted it as "" twosome gruesome , uh , different sizes different this "" , and , um , actually what I meant to say was"
[02:02] fe066 | Whoa .
[02:04] fe008 | It 's really enormously far away . Now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad .
"[02:09] fe069 | That 's what I was just thinking , or maybe it was really quiet or something ? I don't know ."
[02:15] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:18] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:22] fe008 | Then , um , I have a couple of others . So , there 's one , um So ,"
"[02:26] fe008 | the person said , "" interesting idea "" , but Tigerfish thought it was , "" uh , just an idea "" . Now that changes the meaning ."
[02:32] fe066 | Right .
[02:33] fe067 | Hmm .
[02:33] fe008 | It 's interesting .
[02:33] me070 | Hmm .
[02:34] fe068 | Right .
"[02:34] fe008 | And then there are various ones like , um , um , "" ish decay "" instead of "" HTK "" ."
[02:41] fe066 | Oh .
"[02:41] fe068 | i "" Ish decay "" ?"
"[02:45] fe068 | Yeah , what 's an "" ish "" ?"
[02:50] fe069 | Wow .
[02:53] fe068 | Yeah .
"[02:56] fe069 | who had an accent , maybe ?"
[02:58] fe008 | Always conceivable . I don't remember off hand . I did check the example .
"[03:02] fe008 | And , um ,"
"[03:04] fe008 | well , and this this would be consistent . So , uh , it was transcribed as "" with H "" , but it was really "" with age "" . Yeah ."
[03:09] fe069 | Mmm .
[03:09] fe066 | Mmm .
"[03:11] fe008 | And , uh , then there are some where actually punctuation"
[03:25] fe066 | Oh .
[03:27] fe067 | Hmm .
[03:27] fe069 | Oh .
[03:28] fe069 | That 's very subtle .
"[03:30] fe008 | It is subtle . And yet , you know , it 's like And instead of instead of "" and it 's """
"[03:34] fe008 | they put "" Annette 's "" ."
[03:42] me070 | Right .
[03:42] fe069 | Right .
"[03:42] fe008 | but , um , it 's ,"
"[03:44] fe008 | you know , conceivable . And then ,"
[03:45] me070 | Hmm .
"[03:46] fe008 | um ,"
[03:47] fe008 | let 's see . There 's one other here I thought was interesting .
[03:58] fe008 | This is Jerry Feldman .
"[03:59] fe008 | And , uh , instead it was transcribed with "" the "" and then an uncertain syllable "" the the "" and then "" all the slides will be fine "" ."
"[04:08] fe008 | Which is interesting . And and , you know , this was a case where the timebin was off . I wanted to bring an example where th"
[04:09] fe067 | Hmm .
[04:12] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[04:12] fe069 | Oh .
[04:12] fe066 | Yeah .
"[04:13] fe008 | So "" all the slides "" it 's w started too late . It 's another case of devoicing at the initial Yeah ."
[04:14] me070 | Right .
[04:16] fe066 | Right .
[04:17] fe069 | Uh - huh .
"[04:19] fe008 | So , I thought that was very interesting ."
"[04:28] fe008 | um ,"
"[04:29] fe008 | if well first of all , there 's this overall point that it shows a degree to which , when you listen to speech , and when you 're just , in general , listening , probably ,"
"[04:36] fe008 | but it shows espec specifically this to this task , that it 's very constructive . You 're not going on simply the auditory there 's a huge contribution from the top - down processing ,"
"[04:45] fe008 | and the you know , e different types . You 've got the contextual information , you have syntax , you have"
"[04:50] fe008 | your mastery of English , and these various things . But I think these kinds of errors , it just shows the degree which it 's not strictly an acoustic"
[04:56] fe008 | task .
[04:56] me070 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[04:57] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
"[04:57] fe008 | And the other thing I think that 's interesting is ,"
[04:57] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:02] fe008 | the types of confusions that happen ,"
"[05:05] fe008 | um , do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus . So ,"
"[05:09] fe008 | the stress tends to be preserved , you know , the content word will be substituted for another content word ,"
"[05:15] fe008 | and , um ,"
[05:21] fe008 | how plausible something can be with without it being correct .
[05:25] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:25] fe008 | Because it really seems like it 's And then often ,"
[05:26] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:29] fe008 | you know , i it 's , um , i there 's ex the parentheses are used , so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match ."
[05:35] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:35] fe008 | But , uh . OK . Now having said that I 'm I 'm impressed by h"
[05:51] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:51] fe068 | Actually , that comes back to a point ."
[05:56] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[05:58] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:01] fe068 | OK , so , let me just think of an example . Um ,"
"[06:04] fe068 | OK , let 's say I say , "" Well , that would be hard to do , so . """
[06:07] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:08] fe068 | OK , right ? And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that"
"[06:12] fe068 | "" so that would be hard "" ,"
"[06:13] fe068 | comma , "" so """
[06:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:17] me070 | Mm - hmm . Would you put a period after "" so "" ?"
[06:19] fe068 | Right .
[06:19] me070 | You would or you wouldn't ?
"[06:20] fe068 | "" So . """
[06:21] fe068 | Yeah .
"[06:21] fe068 | Yeah , I would just sort of end it ."
[06:21] me070 | Yes .
[06:22] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:23] fe068 | But then sometimes they transcribe it like "" So that would be a problem "" , period ,"
"[06:27] fe068 | new word , like capitalized "" So "" ."
[06:29] fe066 | Oh .
[06:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[06:29] me070 | Right .
"[06:30] fe069 | Oh , like it 's a whole new utterance . Like it 's not connected ."
"[06:31] fe068 | Right . And and it just seems to sotal totally that that 's not the meaning . And and it changes the meaning , I think ."
[06:32] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[06:45] me070 | Uh - huh .
"[06:50] fe068 | Or whatever , yeah , "" that would be a problem "" , whatever . Yeah ."
"[06:52] fe008 | "" That 'd be a problem , """
[06:52] me070 | Right .
"[06:53] fe008 | "" so . """
"[06:54] fe068 | "" So . """
[06:55] fe008 | And how does it change the meaning ? What 's what are the two different meanings there ?
[06:57] fe068 | It seems like because if I was just reading that
"[07:01] fe068 | thing , I would say ,"
[07:06] fe008 | OK .
"[07:06] fe068 | You know what I mean ? Th - if if it was like , "" period , capital SO "" , as opposed to ,"
[07:16] me070 | Right .
"[07:17] me070 | I think the second one where the "" so "" is all by itself , it 's like , "" So that would be a problem . So . "" You know , the "" so "" is like"
"[07:22] fe066 | Right , as though it 's leading into something else ."
"[07:23] me070 | disconnected from the Yeah , the first one is like , the "" so "" is connected to the sentence , and "" That 'd be a problem , so . "" You know , it 's but the next one is like"
[07:26] fe066 | Bu And yeah .
[07:28] fe066 | I
[07:33] fe069 | It 's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about .
[07:34] fe066 | A new subject .
"[07:36] fe066 | The first one , too , is more like To me , I don't necessarily put ,"
[07:37] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:40] fe066 | um , like a d a p a p"
"[07:42] fe066 | a period after that "" so "" . I might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt interrupted or something , or I would maybe even act as though they were , um , just trailing off ."
[07:48] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[07:53] me070 | Right .
[07:53] fe066 | So put that those two dots after it .
[07:55] me070 | I do that too . I
"[07:56] fe066 | Um , uh , which depending on what 's going on ,"
"[07:59] fe066 | like , I 'll do that . Cuz to me it sounds more like they 're trailing off ."
[08:00] me070 | Right .
[08:02] fe069 | Yeah .
"[08:05] fe066 | Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[08:05] fe069 | Yeah .
[08:05] fe067 | Mmm .
[08:06] fe068 | Right .
"[08:08] me070 | You know , and but and then ofte often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say , but they couldn't really , you know And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash ."
[08:08] fe066 | Right .
[08:09] fe066 | Yeah .
[08:14] fe069 | Yeah .
[08:16] fe069 | Yep .
"[08:24] fe069 | "" What are we gonna do now , "" but they don't say that ."
[08:25] me070 | Mmm .
[08:25] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[08:25] me070 | Yeah .
[08:25] fe069 | Yeah .
[08:26] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:33] fe008 | how that y th th the fact that you 're raising this , I li I like this example that , um ,"
[08:38] fe008 | we have
"[08:39] fe008 | several things that are being cued by intonation ,"
[08:41] fe068 | Right .
[08:43] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[08:48] fe008 | then I would think that there should be a period there .
[08:50] fe066 | Period . Right .
[08:50] me070 | Right .
"[08:51] fe008 | And then especially if you 've got a pause following it , but you don't always y these things are correlated but they 're not perfect ."
"[08:56] fe066 | That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up , because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings ."
[09:05] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:05] me070 | Yeah . That 's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers , is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation because their intonation is totally different ."
[09:05] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[09:08] fe066 | Right .
[09:15] me070 | I mean Non - native speakers is what I meant . Yeah .
[09:16] fe069 | Yeah .
"[09:17] fe008 | Absolutely . Yeah , absolutely ."
"[09:18] fe066 | And also if you 're a non - native speaker transcribing it , you wouldn't necessarily kn uh , kn understand the conventions of English t intonation as , you know , intimately as a native speaker might ."
[09:18] me070 | Yeah .
[09:21] me070 | That 's true .
[09:27] me070 | Right . Mm - hmm .
"[09:28] fe069 | Well , I would hope they would have native speaker transcribers"
[09:32] fe069 | transcribing .
[09:37] fe069 | Oh y yeah .
"[09:38] fe069 | No , that 's not what I meant , but that would be cool . No , what I meant was that I would hope that , for"
[09:38] me070 | Oh .
[09:40] fe008 | That 'd be nice .
[09:43] fe069 | meetings in English you would have native speakers transcribing it because it you would have more intuitions about what should be there . Even if you can't fully
[09:46] fe008 | I agree .
[09:48] me070 | Yeah .
[09:49] fe066 | n Yeah .
[09:54] fe066 | Right .
"[09:58] fe069 | those things , the f"
[09:58] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:02] fe008 | I I OK - So , in terms of like when you 're going through the Tigerfish transcripts , you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases ?"
[10:09] fe069 | Not this t t
[10:10] fe066 | Not so much . No .
[10:10] fe008 | OK .
"[10:15] fe069 | Sometimes , but they tend to be pretty good about parentheses ."
[10:19] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[10:19] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[10:20] fe008 | Good . Good to hear .
[10:23] fe069 | Yeah .
[10:27] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[10:28] fe069 | Exactly .
"[10:28] fe068 | Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of "" twosome gruesome "" , like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something ? And ,"
[10:28] fe008 | Good .
"[10:35] fe068 | uh , this is the interpretation that came to mind or something ?"
[10:35] fe008 | It 's Could be .
[10:38] fe069 | Yeah .
"[10:39] fe068 | You know what I mean ? Like , where would you get the word "" gruesome "" ?"
[10:42] fe069 | I don't know .
"[10:43] fe068 | You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ? Anyway ."
"[10:44] fe069 | Well , I mean , you get the "" GR "" from "" groups "" , I guess , but"
[10:47] fe068 | Yeah .
[10:48] me070 | Yeah .
[10:49] fe069 | I don't know where the rest of it came from .
"[10:50] me070 | Uh , "" groups of "" , "" gruesome "" ."
[10:53] fe068 | OK .
"[10:56] me070 | You 've got the , uh , "" S "" in the middle ."
"[10:57] fe066 | Yeah . If you if for some reason they didn't hear the "" F "" , if they didn't hear the "" fuh "" , it might just sound like Yeah , "" grou "" uh , "" gruesuh "" ."
"[11:02] me070 | "" Gruesome "" ."
[11:06] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:06] me070 | Yeah . It 's both labial at the end .
[11:13] fe068 | Right .
"[11:14] fe066 | "" Fff "" . Because also , I mean , "" F "" is"
"[11:19] fe069 | I wonder where the "" P "" went , though ?"
[11:22] fe069 | Yeah ?
"[11:24] fe066 | Yeah , because it 's , um ,"
"[11:25] fe066 | bilabial too . "" Fff "" . you know , you 'll"
[11:28] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:30] fe066 | you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to "" mmm "" , you know . You 're getting the closure of the lips . So maybe that 's"
"[11:32] fe069 | Nnn , I guess ."
[11:38] fe066 | getting . I don't know .
[11:39] fe069 | It 's possible .
[11:41] fe067 | Hmm .
[11:43] me070 | Hmm .
[11:47] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:47] me070 | Yeah .
[11:49] fe008 | Yeah .
"[11:50] me070 | Yeah , that 's really hard , th"
[11:50] fe008 | OK .
[11:52] me070 | to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it 's occurring in .
[11:56] fe066 | Yeah .
[12:01] me070 | Yeah .
"[12:01] fe008 | sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses , see if I can do it just by itself , but"
"[12:07] fe008 | it it 's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque , and then you go back to , you know , the person 's previous utterance or you go to the mixed channel , or you ,"
[12:16] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[12:20] fe008 | very surprising .
[12:21] fe066 | Yeah .
[12:23] fe008 | Good .
"[12:23] fe068 | But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people"
[12:31] fe008 | Yes .
"[12:31] fe068 | is , uh is much more common ."
[12:31] fe069 | Is that what it 's about ?
"[12:33] fe069 | I wasn't I couldn't u I don't know , for some reason that didn't make sense to me . But th it 's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they 're set on ? OK ."
[12:38] fe068 | Right .
"[12:39] fe068 | And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely , like , you know , Morgan 'll be on Jane 's channel , or just something bizarre like that ."
[12:47] fe069 | Yeah .
"[12:48] fe068 | Um ,"
[12:49] fe068 | so .
"[12:52] fe066 | you 're supposed to sp Do they ? I mean , maybe they don't really realize that you 're supposed to split it up . Or something like , they maybe think , "" Well , I hear it just as clearly I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly and I realize it 's not"
"[13:02] fe066 | Jane , and I realize it 's not a female even , but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel ,"
[13:07] fe069 | I 'm supposed to do it .
"[13:08] fe066 | I 'm supposed to transcribe it . """
[13:09] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[13:10] fe066 | I I 'd imagine that 's p that might be what that is .
"[13:12] fe069 | They probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting , or w anything ."
[13:19] fe008 | they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they 're transcribing .
[13:20] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:22] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[13:22] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:23] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[13:26] me070 | Yeah .
"[13:28] fe069 | Wow . We 're we 're really spoiled , then , with our"
[13:28] fe068 | Yeah .
[13:31] fe067 | Mmm .
"[13:31] fe069 | interface here , right ?"
[13:33] fe008 | Yeah .
[13:35] fe069 | s it 's
[13:36] fe069 | very useful .
"[13:37] fe068 | If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um ,"
[13:39] fe008 | Yes .
"[13:42] fe068 | the men get moved onto other channels , maybe more frequently . And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices and they 're getting picked up on more channels ,"
"[13:49] fe068 | um , than their own channel . Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing ."
[13:51] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:52] fe008 | OK .
"[13:52] fe069 | Or they just tend to sp peak louder , maybe ?"
"[13:54] fe066 | That 's true . They do they do say that m men 's voices c carry better . I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think who was telling me ? Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um ,"
[13:55] fe068 | Yeah .
[14:06] fe066 | airports .
[14:07] fe008 | Oh !
[14:08] me070 | Hmm .
[14:13] fe069 | For announcements and things ?
"[14:14] fe066 | Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception ,"
[14:15] fe067 | Hmm .
"[14:18] fe066 | um , better than a lot of female voices ."
[14:21] fe068 | Hmm .
[14:21] fe069 | Hmm .
"[14:23] fe069 | They should do that at BART , too , because"
[14:25] fe008 | I see .
[14:27] fe008 | So -
[14:29] me070 | Hmm .
"[14:34] fe008 | Huh . So so this means that people with hearing problems would hear , uh , uh , one of these announcements"
[14:39] fe008 | better if it were a male voice then .
"[14:39] fe066 | d Yeah , depending on their auditory , um , capabilities . I mean , if their"

"[15:11] fe066 | if that part of the brain normally codes for ,"
[15:22] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[15:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[15:24] fe008 | Selective .
"[15:25] fe066 | but yeah , if I guess for most h"
"[15:27] fe066 | hearers it 's just easier . And it 's like a certain ,"
"[15:30] fe066 | uh , kind of , like , rough male voice too , kind of graspy raspy , I mean ,"
[15:36] fe068 | Hmm .
[15:36] fe067 | Hmm .
[15:36] me070 | Hmm .
[15:36] fe066 | apparently .
[15:36] fe069 | Hmm .
[15:37] fe066 | Is better .
"[15:39] fe066 | Yeah , I guess so ."
"[15:45] fe008 | our system here , the recording system ,"
"[15:47] fe008 | may have some of the same channel restr some sort of s channel restrictions , such as"
"[15:53] fe008 | they ran across when they were looking at telephone ,"
"[15:56] fe008 | uh , transmissions at a certain point . Cuz , you know , telephone transmissions , um , there 's some filtering going on . You don't hear the full the full band of frequencies ."
[16:02] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[16:03] fe069 | Oh .
[16:04] me070 | Right .
[16:05] fe067 | Hmm .
"[16:05] fe008 | And , w uh v"
[16:06] fe008 | I asked c a couple of people and they c
[16:09] fe066 | It 's really interesting .
"[16:10] fe008 | It was intere an interesting it 's reminded me because of the comment about noise , noise being sp really spreading frequencies across ,"
[16:16] fe066 | Uh - huh .
[16:16] fe069 | Yeah .
"[16:17] fe008 | uh , using frequencies across a broader spectrum . So in a way , bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have ."
[16:25] fe008 | a useful kind of increase in frequency range .
"[16:27] fe066 | Right . Yeah . I was just saying that it , like , you know , sometimes , um ,"
[16:38] fe069 | Yeah .
"[16:39] fe066 | and , uh , oftentimes the "" fuh "" is"
"[16:45] fe066 | um , by filtering in some of the older phones ."
[16:49] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:49] fe066 | And that 's why , like he"
[16:49] fe067 | Hmm .
[16:49] fe069 | So what was the answer here ? It that 's not the case ?
[16:51] fe008 | Answer ?
[16:52] fe008 | That they that they don't . We don't have a reduction
"[16:54] fe069 | Oh , OK ."
[16:54] fe066 | Y right .
[16:55] fe008 | in that direction .
[16:56] fe069 | Good .
[17:01] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[17:01] me070 | Right .
[17:02] fe008 | there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate
"[17:07] fe008 | but then that becomes So Adam 's ans that then it becomes a matter of , Is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range ."
[17:09] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:14] fe008 | And , I didn't really have the sense that it would ."
"[17:17] fe066 | I didn't get that from him , actually . I felt like , um , he 's basically saying that for our for"
"[17:23] fe066 | all intents and purposes with this , it 's covering"
[17:24] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:26] fe066 | whatever sounds are necessary to be covered , like everything . That 's that 's what I th"
[17:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[17:30] fe008 | Good . I I that was my impression also . It wa so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones . And actually in the work that they were doing with
"[17:40] fe008 | uh , certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach is because of the of the filtering ."
[17:45] fe068 | Hmm .
"[17:46] fe008 | I mean it does seem like when I hear these things , except for the distortion parts ,"
"[17:49] fe008 | where the volume 's too high , or th of course when the volume 's too low , but that 's a different problem ,"
"[17:54] fe008 | um , except for those cases , it seems to me that"
[17:56] fe008 | it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear . I don't feel that it 's being reduced in any way .
[17:59] fe069 | Yeah .
[18:00] fe067 | Hmm .
[18:00] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:01] fe069 | Yeah , that 's what it seems like ."
"[18:01] fe066 | Yeah . Yeah , I do too ."
[18:02] fe066 | Yeah .
[18:02] fe008 | Yeah ?
[18:10] fe066 | Right .
"[18:13] fe008 | I thought that was very interesting . So bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower because you have ,"
[18:36] fe008 | But not helpful for speech .
"[18:38] fe066 | in the case of something with clipping , does it were you saying that , uh it it increases to or , expands to accommodate that ? Or , no ?"
[18:47] fe008 | than so it 's actually paradoxical in a way cuz you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better .
[18:49] fe066 | Oh .
[18:52] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:52] fe008 | But in the cases of of distortion than you can end up with ,"
"[18:55] fe066 | Right . Oh , OK . Yeah . I see what you 're saying ."
"[18:56] fe008 | uh ,"
[18:56] fe008 | a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech .
[18:58] fe066 | Right .
[18:58] me070 | Right .
[18:58] fe068 | Hmm .
[19:02] fe008 | So .
[19:02] fe069 | I have a question .
[19:03] fe008 | Yes .
"[19:04] fe069 | In the some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes , or what I called spikes ."
[19:09] fe008 | Yes .
[19:11] fe069 | I was wondering what that
"[19:13] fe069 | is . I don't even know if it 's relevant or useful to know , but I 'm just curious ."
"[19:16] fe008 | One source was , there was a problem with a connection"
"[19:19] fe008 | where the microphone went int went into a box I was trying trying to think of this as prior to yes , it was prior to the wireless . There was a particular connection which wasn't wireless ,"
[19:19] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:27] fe008 | which was , um , mechanically bad in some some sense , and if it got touched , it would s it would send an impulse ,"
[19:29] fe069 | Loose . Yeah .
[19:30] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[19:32] fe066 | Oh .
[19:34] fe067 | Hmm .
[19:35] fe008 | i in al
[19:35] fe008 | an irrelevant non - wanted artifact .
[19:37] fe069 | Yeah .
[19:38] me070 | Hmm .
[19:38] fe069 | Cuz those ones sometimes were
[19:38] fe066 | Huh .
[19:40] fe069 | extraordinarily bad and pai Yeah .
[19:40] me070 | Painful . Yeah .
[19:42] me070 | They were painful .
[19:46] fe068 | Yeah .
"[19:47] fe066 | I do remember those , actually ."
"[19:48] fe068 | Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something ."
"[19:50] fe066 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . I remember I had one . One with that and it was just , al all the time . Yeah ."
"[19:50] fe069 | Yeah . Or , like , skip it entirely ."
[19:55] fe069 | Yeah .
[19:55] me070 | Oh yeah .
[19:56] fe069 | Yeah .
[19:56] fe008 | Yeah .
[19:58] fe069 | Y y yeah .
[20:02] fe008 | Yeah . That 's really awful . You 've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening ? Good .
[20:05] fe069 | Yes . Absolutely .
[20:05] me070 | Oh yeah . Mm - hmm .
[20:05] fe066 | Yes .
[20:07] fe068 | But sometimes you 'll see like
"[20:08] fe068 | something coming up like , "" Uh - oh . Someone 's gonna cough really loudly "" , and I could tell because of the way it looks ! Or "" someone 's about to laugh really loudly "" ,"
[20:13] fe069 | Yeah .
[20:16] fe069 | And so you turn it down ?
"[20:16] fe068 | um yeah , and then you 're just sort you 've got like you know you 're sort of like Yeah . So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully ."
[20:22] fe067 | Hmm .
[20:22] me070 | Yeah .
[20:24] fe069 | I think that 's really important .
"[20:26] fe069 | Yeah , I think that 's really important because I generally have the volume turned up"
[20:26] fe068 | Yeah .
[20:27] fe068 | So .
"[20:30] fe069 | to above normal volume just so I can hear more clearly , and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful ."
[20:31] me070 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[20:31] fe066 | Right .
[20:33] fe068 | Yeah .
[20:36] fe068 | You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah .
"[20:37] fe069 | I think you could , yeah ."
[20:38] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:38] fe068 | Oh , yeah . So ."
[20:38] fe067 | Hmm .
[20:46] fe008 | that 's saved me a bunch of times .
"[20:48] fe068 | Gives some good clues , yeah ."
[20:51] fe068 | Oh yeah . Yeah .
[20:51] me070 | Yeah .
"[20:51] fe066 | Oh , yeah ."
[20:53] fe008 | Yeah .
"[20:55] fe068 | Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though , and so sometimes you have to , um ,"
[20:57] fe069 | No .
"[21:00] fe069 | Or , turn up"
"[21:02] fe068 | Yeah , you have to the resolution , right ? So ."
[21:04] me070 | Right .
"[21:04] fe008 | It might be useful to to talk about the interface for for a bit , in terms of what it is that you like particularly , and what you don't ,"
[21:08] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:11] fe008 | and , uh , that kind of thing ."
"[21:12] me070 | You know what I would think would be a really n um , neat feature for the interface ?"
[21:16] me070 | Some sort of backwards tab where it could go backwards without you having to
"[21:19] fe008 | Ooh , interesting ."
[21:22] fe069 | Yeah .
[21:22] fe066 | T Yeah .
[21:23] fe067 | Hmm .
[21:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[21:28] fe066 | That 's true .
"[21:28] me070 | such a hassle . It 'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like , you know ,"
[21:36] fe068 | Hmm .
[21:37] fe069 | But it would play it backwards too .
"[21:42] fe069 | But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ?"
[21:43] fe068 | Just to jump it back .
[21:45] me070 | Yeah .
[21:46] fe008 | Interesting .
"[21:47] fe068 | Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear It 'll be in right in the middle of the timebin , and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again cuz you 've already gotten the first part ."
[21:47] fe008 | Hmm .
[21:50] fe066 | Right .
[21:51] me070 | Right
[21:51] fe069 | Yeah .
[21:51] fe067 | Mmm .
[21:52] me070 | Oh yeah . Yeah .
"[21:53] fe068 | So you just want it to go back ,"
[21:55] fe066 | And otherwise you have to drag it .
"[21:56] me070 | Yeah , some timebins are humongous , and"
"[21:57] fe069 | Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it ."
[21:58] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:58] me070 | if you miss it , you know , you 've gotta go back and find it , and"
[22:01] fe066 | Right .
"[22:01] me070 | dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it , even ."
[22:04] fe069 | Yeah .
[22:05] me070 | You know ?
[22:05] fe068 | That 's true .
[22:05] fe069 | I think that would be useful .
[22:07] me070 | Yeah .
[22:07] fe008 | Interesting idea . I 'll I 'll s I 'll suggest that to the charer .
"[22:10] fe068 | Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go ."
"[22:12] fe069 | Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues ."
[22:12] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:15] fe068 | Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff , right ?"
[22:20] fe068 | Yeah .
[22:20] fe069 | I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time .
[22:23] me070 | Mmm .
[22:24] fe069 | And that I would it would crack a lot . It was very weird .
[22:26] fe068 | Yeah . Ooh !
[22:27] fe067 | Mmm .
[22:28] fe008 | That 's it 's good to be careful about the mousing . You were gonna say ?
[22:31] fe008 | Yeah .
[22:33] fe069 | Uh - huh .
[22:33] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:39] fe008 | How do you mean "" expand "" ? What do you mean by "" expand "" ?"
"[22:41] fe066 | Oh , uh , in terms of , um ,"
"[22:43] fe066 | if , uh if it 's it 's if it 's cut off , like the beginning of an utterance , I 'll move it move the line back . And I usually just use the mouse ."
[22:46] fe008 | OK .
[22:46] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[22:47] fe008 | OK . OK .
[22:48] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[22:50] fe066 | How do you do that with the keyboard ?
"[22:52] fe069 | Well , I would press "" tab "" and listen to where I wanted it to stop , and then press "" return "" , create a new timebin ,"
"[22:53] fe068 | I do that with the mouse , yeah ."
[22:58] fe066 | Oh . y
"[22:58] fe069 | and then "" shift "" "" shift "" , what is it ? "" Shift "" , "" backspace "" to c collapse it , yeah ."
"[22:59] me070 | and then "" shift "" "" backspace "" . That 's that 's what I do , yeah . I do it all on the keyboard ."
"[23:00] fe066 | Oh , OK . So you just do it that way . OK . OK ."
[23:04] fe068 | Oh .
[23:04] fe066 | OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse .
[23:04] fe008 | Yeah .
"[23:07] fe069 | Oh . Do you drag do you drag the line ? See , I never I never do that for some reason ."
[23:07] me070 | Oh really ?
[23:08] fe066 | Because you can just click y I just drag the line .
[23:12] me070 | I don't do that either .
[23:12] fe008 | I vary . I I should it depends on how much I wanna go back and how certain the boundary is .
[23:15] fe069 | Yeah .
"[23:16] fe008 | If I can see it if it 's if I can see this thing 's coming up and it 's just so clear , it 's that mountain right there , I can tell ,"
"[23:16] fe066 | Oh yeah , that 's true ."
[23:16] fe069 | Yeah .
[23:16] me070 | Right .
[23:21] fe069 | Yeah .
"[23:21] fe066 | Right , then I 'll drag it . Y"
[23:21] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:22] fe008 | then yeah , dragging is really f efficient . But if it 's like a mess in there , then it helps me to be able to locate it with"
[23:24] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[23:28] fe008 | the actual clicking .
[23:29] fe066 | Right .
[23:29] fe069 | Yeah .
[23:29] fe067 | Mmm .
[23:30] fe008 | And then do this what th you were just describing .
[23:31] fe069 | Yeah .
"[23:33] fe069 | Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having"
[23:40] fe066 | Ah . Yeah .
"[23:40] fe069 | Because I 'll tend to delete things , or go too far , or something , or I 'll be holding down "" shift "" because I wanna type something as a capital , and then end up collapsing the timebins ."
[23:42] fe066 | Yeah .
[23:43] fe067 | Ni -
[23:45] fe068 | Oh yeah .
[23:46] fe066 | Yeah .
"[23:47] fe066 | Yep . Yep , yep , yep ."
[23:49] fe066 | Yep .
[23:49] fe066 | Yep .
"[23:50] fe069 | So , it might be better to"
[23:51] fe066 | Yep .
[23:52] fe069 | use a different keys or something .
[23:52] fe068 | Yeah .
"[23:54] fe008 | if I were to add an option , it might be to have an undo for that ."
[23:57] fe069 | Yeah . Yeah !
[23:57] fe066 | Yeah .
[23:58] me070 | Yeah . That would be nice .
"[23:58] fe066 | That would be great . I 've erased entire utterances before , accidentally ."
"[23:59] fe008 | Yeah , s Good ."
"[24:02] fe069 | but , or just to change the keys used , you know , for for that option ."
"[24:05] me070 | Yeah . I 'm rather used to it now , though . Yeah ."
"[24:10] me070 | Mm - hmm . You 're so scared , yeah ."
[24:10] fe066 | do you do this too ? I 'm so scared .
"[24:20] me070 | You 're typing capitals , and you 're backspacing , and you 're like"
[24:39] fe008 | Mmm .
[24:45] me070 | Oh yeah .
"[24:46] fe068 | or vice versa it 's just , uh it 's like"
"[24:46] me070 | Or vice versa , yeah ."
"[24:48] fe068 | I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different , and I have to just get used just get used to it again Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place ."
[24:54] fe067 | The little accent thingy .
[24:57] fe067 | Right .
"[24:59] fe068 | Oh yeah , and then I 'll keep I keep caps - locking too cuz the caps - lock 's in a different spot ."
[25:00] fe008 | Oh .
"[25:03] me070 | Oh , yeah ."
[25:03] fe069 | Yeah .
[25:03] fe068 | So .
[25:04] fe067 | Hmm .
[25:07] fe069 | It 's just th right above the backspace .
[25:07] fe068 | Th -
[25:09] fe067 | Yeah .
[25:15] fe067 | Mmm .
[25:16] fe008 | I see .
"[25:16] fe068 | Oh ! Yeah , I do that all the time ."
[25:17] fe069 | Yeah .
[25:18] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[25:21] fe069 | I think so .
[25:22] me070 | Yeah .
[25:22] fe066 | Yeah .
[25:22] fe067 | Yeah .
[25:24] fe069 | Right .
[25:24] me070 | Right . I I 'm used to it now too .
"[25:26] fe069 | I 'm used to the SUN one , I guess , now ."
[25:26] fe008 | OK .
"[25:27] fe066 | Yeah . But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on"
[25:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[25:36] fe008 | Basmati ?
"[25:36] fe066 | No , the other one ."
[25:37] fe008 | Amaretto ?
[25:38] fe066 | Amaretto .
[25:38] fe008 | OK .
[25:39] fe069 | Amaretto has a different one . Linguine is Basmati have the same .
[25:41] fe066 | Right . And it 's and I always use I tend to use Linguine .
[25:42] fe069 | Right ?
[25:54] fe069 | Yeah .
"[26:01] fe066 | But , yeah . I I I have noticed that I 'll screw some stuff up , like , when I 'm trying to get re - adj"
"[26:05] fe008 | S so which t I I 've forgotten which one is which . So , which one do you"
[26:06] fe069 | But just the beginning .
"[26:09] fe008 | prefer ? Is it is it the So , if we had a show of hands , how many people would vote for the SUN keyboard"
[26:12] me070 | OK .
[26:14] fe008 | versus the So let 's put it the other way . How many people would not vote for the SUN keyboard ?
[26:18] fe008 | Would vote for the other one ? The PC PC keyboard ?
[26:20] fe066 | The PC ? I would vote for the PC .
[26:20] me070 | The PC one ?
"[26:21] fe069 | The PC one is the Amaretto one , right ?"
[26:24] fe068 | Huh .
[26:24] me070 | I I 'm not sure which one is which .
[26:26] fe068 | Yeah .
[26:26] fe068 | I just get used to it . So .
"[26:28] me070 | Yeah . I mean like , when I first had started working I would have definitely wanted the PC keyboard , but now I 'm I 'm just used to it ."
[26:28] fe067 | Yeah .
[26:30] fe008 | The Linguine is OK .
[26:34] fe008 | You 're multi - keyb
[26:34] fe069 | I prefer th I prefer the one on Linguine or Basmati . I don't know what it 's called .
[26:35] fe068 | Yeah .
"[26:39] fe008 | OK , let 's do it that way . So so if we if we have a map of the room ,"
[26:39] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[26:43] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[26:45] fe069 | Oh .
[26:45] fe008 | the one on the left is that Basmati ? OK .
"[26:46] fe067 | By the light switch , yeah ."
[26:47] fe066 | Yep .
"[26:47] fe068 | I believe that 's correct , yeah . Linguine must be the one in the left - hand corner ."
[26:47] fe069 | Yeah .
[26:49] fe066 | Linguine is the one in the corner .
[26:49] fe069 | In the c
[26:52] fe008 | And then the f the far right corner as you walk in ?
"[26:54] me070 | Yeah , r Yeah , that 's that one 's got the the PC keyboard , and then the two on those sides have the , um , SUN keyboard ."
"[27:00] fe066 | Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you"
[27:04] me070 | Right .
[27:04] fe008 | Yep .
[27:05] fe066 | is Amaretto .
[27:06] fe008 | U u
[27:06] fe068 | Hmm .
[27:07] fe066 | And the one to the left of that against the far corner
[27:10] fe008 | Good .
[27:10] fe066 | is Linguine .
[27:11] fe008 | OK .
[27:11] fe068 | Hmm .
"[27:12] fe008 | And the one close to you is Basmati . OK . So now , ha ha who would 've So ,"
[27:13] fe066 | Right .
[27:14] me070 | Yes .
"[27:16] fe008 | if you have a strong Now you 're bi - keyboardal so ,"
"[27:22] fe008 | but , um ,"
[27:22] fe008 | who who would prefer the keyboard on Linguine ?
[27:27] fe008 | OK . We got two votes for Linguine . And who would prefer Amaretto ?
[27:33] fe008 | Amaretto ? So we got more more multi - keyboardal people ?
[27:34] fe067 | Ready .
[27:35] fe068 | I just have no preference .
"[27:37] fe008 | Well , that 's lovely . Same here ? Excellent . OK , so i"
"[27:37] fe067 | Yeah , it doesn't really matter ."
[27:38] me070 | Yeah .
[27:38] fe068 | Yeah .
[27:38] fe067 | Yeah .
[27:39] fe068 | It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute and then I sorta get used to it .
"[27:41] me070 | Exactly , exactly ."
[27:41] fe069 | I I I could get used to I could get used to it too .
"[27:43] fe066 | Yeah , I could get used to it too ."
[27:44] fe008 | OK .
[27:44] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[27:44] fe068 | Huh .
[27:45] fe066 | i Right .
[27:46] fe069 | I don't know . Cuz I always use it .
"[27:47] fe008 | I pr I see . I I have experienced this keyboard conflict , and f with me the things that are confusing are th where the control key is , so I end up"
[27:55] fe069 | Mmm .
"[27:55] fe008 | pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one , whiche whichever it is ."
"[27:56] me070 | Oh , that 's true . I forgot about that one , yeah ."
[27:57] fe069 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[27:58] fe066 | Oh .
[27:59] fe067 | Mmm .
[27:59] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[27:59] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:00] fe008 | I could easily put a PC keyboard in there if anyone had I we already have one , I could add ane another one we so , w"
[28:05] me070 | Right .
"[28:06] fe008 | you know , maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted ."
"[28:10] fe008 | But , um ,"
[28:12] fe008 | OK .
[28:13] fe008 | That 's good .
"[28:15] fe008 | Oh , let me see . So , um , I I wanted to ,"
"[28:19] fe008 | um , m maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this , and one thing that I 've"
[28:26] fe008 | really been surprised by is how
"[28:29] fe008 | unique the shapes of some of these things are . I know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers ,"
[28:35] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:36] fe008 | and , um ,"
"[28:37] fe008 | um ,"
"[28:38] fe008 | I 've forgotten Someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it . They could see the the waveform and "" Oh , it 's gonna be a seven . "" Becau -"
[28:43] me070 | Oh wow .
"[28:44] fe069 | I I remember recognizing certain numbers . I don mmm , I don't remember which"
"[28:53] fe069 | well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason . It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it , and then it grew really big . So like "" four "" and "" five """
"[29:02] fe069 | and "" three "" all had this same characteristic , and "" six """
[29:08] me070 | Hmm .
"[29:13] fe069 | "" Eight "" , um , I remember"
[29:16] fe069 | tended that people tended to not pronounce the
"[29:19] fe069 | last "" T "" ."
[29:20] fe008 | Oh .
"[29:21] fe069 | And when they did , it was slightly"
"[29:23] fe069 | farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected . Same with "" six "" ."
[29:25] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:28] fe069 | The "" X "" , well the "" KS "" or whatever , at the end . But Yeah ."
[29:30] fe068 | Hmm .
[29:31] me070 | Hmm .
[29:34] fe069 | that was really interesting to notice that .
"[29:36] fe069 | Uh ,"
"[29:37] fe069 | It 's a very different interface , though . I mean , it seems very"
[29:38] fe008 | Mm - hmm . It is different .
[29:40] fe069 | strange .
"[29:40] fe008 | Well , it w it would it had the benefit"
"[29:43] fe008 | of it So , this this was to handle the digits , uh , only , which is what you figure . And , um , did you I thought you might have done that , Joel . Did you also ? So , two people did that , i"
[29:46] me070 | OK .
[29:49] me070 | Nn - nnn . No .
"[29:52] fe008 | um , I thought ."
[29:53] fe068 | I did it a little .
"[29:53] fe008 | Did you do it ? I thought so . Good , good . OK ."
[29:54] fe068 | Just a little bit .
[29:54] fe069 | Yeah .
[29:55] fe068 | Yeah .
"[29:55] fe069 | Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too ."
[30:00] fe008 | @ @
"[30:00] fe068 | Oh , OK ."
[30:00] fe008 | The th
[30:00] me070 | This was a different interface entirely ?
[30:02] fe069 | Yeah .
"[30:02] fe008 | Uh , Adam wrote this as uh , using the same , uh , computer language as Channeltrans is written in ,"
[30:08] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:08] fe008 | and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said ,"
"[30:14] fe008 | and then you would listen to it , and everyth the j"
"[30:17] fe008 | there were two parts to the task , one of them was to see if that 's what they actually said ,"
"[30:21] fe008 | and to indicate , you know , in the i transcribe errors of it . And then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins ."
[30:22] fe066 | Mmm .
[30:23] me070 | Hmm .
[30:27] fe008 | And those data were actually used in some analyses which showed
[30:27] fe068 | Right .
"[30:30] fe008 | uh , very very good results ."
[30:32] fe068 | Good .
[30:32] me070 | Oh wow .
"[30:33] fe008 | And so it shows , I mean it 's it 's useful . This is this is why we do these digits . It 's a nice standard task ,"
[30:38] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[30:38] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:38] fe008 | and you have lots of different voices ,"
[30:38] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[30:40] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:40] fe008 | and it 's very clear . You know what the canani canonical answer is when a person says a number ,"
"[30:46] fe008 | um , at least most of the time , you know what number it was they said . So its"
[30:50] me070 | Right .
"[30:50] fe008 | "" ground truth "" , as they call it , is very clear ."
[30:52] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[30:52] me070 | Hmm .
[30:52] fe066 | Right .
[31:01] fe008 | I th think that we 'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins .
[31:05] me070 | Hmm .
"[31:05] fe069 | If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used"
[31:10] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:10] fe069 | to do certain things . I can't remember what they were , now , but I just remember that it was once you learned them , it was very"
[31:19] fe008 | Excellent .
[31:20] fe069 | couple keys that you used .
[31:20] fe068 | Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them .
[31:23] fe069 | Hmm ?
[31:26] fe069 | Oh .
"[31:28] fe068 | And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere , but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them , so ."
[31:31] fe069 | Yeah .
[31:31] fe008 | That 's right .
[31:32] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[31:33] fe069 | Yeah .
"[31:33] fe008 | I also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed , so I don't think you could use a string search , right ? I mean , I was trying to remember how that worked ."
[31:39] me070 | Mmm .
[31:41] fe008 | But it was difficult finding them for some reason .
[31:41] fe068 | Yeah !
[31:44] fe069 | Yep .
"[31:49] fe068 | it was more complicated . But anyway , than what it would be now , so ."
[31:51] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:58] fe008 | our sister project , the SmartKom project , which involved listening to people"
"[32:03] fe008 | who were supposed to be wandering through Germany , and this is s supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way ."
"[32:03] me070 | Oh , right ."
[32:05] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:11] fe008 | So , um someone else did that too , I 've forgotten who who else did that ? Did anybody else here do that ?"
[32:17] fe008 | OK .
[32:17] fe069 | I feel like I did a little
[32:19] fe069 | checking or something on that .
"[32:21] fe008 | Actually , I think you might have done this also , as I think about it ."
[32:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm . So actually we started with the words and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the s with the actual sounds . Cuz they were reading from a script .
[32:33] fe069 | Yeah .
[32:34] fe069 | Right .
[32:34] fe066 | Mmm .
[32:34] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:35] fe008 | And then there was some conversation in addition , that that , um , needed to be transcribed ."
[32:39] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:40] fe008 | But , um ,"
[32:42] fe008 | yeah .
[32:52] fe067 | Hmm .
[32:55] fe008 | p p p
[32:55] fe008 | if you try to n
"[32:56] fe008 | go up in the transcript , you end up with this huge huge space of time and things covering several screens and it 's just horribly"
[32:58] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[32:58] me070 | Yep .
"[33:04] fe008 | i inefficient , so ."
[33:06] me070 | Yeah .
"[33:07] fe069 | One thing that I still can't figure out with the interface ,"
"[33:15] fe069 | you know , there 's a bar above where this sound wave is , that has , um ,"
[33:23] fe008 | Yes .
[33:24] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[33:25] fe069 | and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting and then it ends up the end . And if you click on that bar to
"[33:29] fe069 | the right of that little marker then it moves forward , if you click on the left it moves back . But sometimes it moves two"
[33:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[33:34] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[33:34] fe066 | Mmm .
[33:37] fe008 | Oh yes . Mm - hmm . I 've noticed that .
[33:38] fe067 | Hmm .
[33:40] fe008 | I think that 's totally dependent w on how you have the resolution set . So that little tiny thing .
[33:43] fe069 | Really ?
"[33:44] fe008 | And if I increase the resolution so it 's spread out a bit more , then I seem to have more control over it ."
[33:49] fe069 | OK .
[33:50] me070 | Mmm .
[33:51] fe069 | Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice
"[33:54] fe066 | That kind of makes sense because Yeah , i"
[33:54] fe008 | Yes .
"[33:55] fe069 | and then in n sometimes i it wouldn't , and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently or I s"
[34:09] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:09] fe066 | seems that it 's covering more ground faster , so I don't know ."
"[34:14] fe008 | I 'm gonna report that to him , cuz I I 've I know that 's one of the reasons why , when I"
"[34:19] fe008 | suggested to visual scan the record , that I suggested doing it by"
[34:22] fe008 | clicking on the right of the of that navigation bar you 're mentioning .
[34:25] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:25] fe008 | Or , actually , clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary , because I had the same problem ."
[34:28] fe069 | Right .
[34:29] fe069 | Yeah .
"[34:30] fe069 | That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave , but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence"
[34:36] fe008 | Yes .
"[34:37] fe008 | Yeah , much more Mm - hmm ."
[34:37] fe069 | sometimes I 'll s
"[34:39] fe069 | ry and be sc try to scan it , but I can't because"
[34:42] fe008 | Cuz you end up missing entire frames . Ye - I was surprised by that . Yeah .
"[34:47] fe008 | Yes , OK . OK ."
[34:48] fe069 | and so I use that sometimes .
[34:51] fe069 | Yeah . Mm - hmm . At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that
[34:52] fe008 | OK .
[34:55] me070 | I didn't know about that .
"[34:55] fe069 | allows you to go like second by second or something , I don't know . Not second by second , but little bit by bit , yeah ."
[34:57] me070 | Really ?
"[34:59] fe008 | So , is this the arrow on the right , it would be underneath that little resolution bar ?"
[35:00] me070 | Oh .
"[35:03] fe008 | I mean , it 's like in that u cluster up there ?"
"[35:08] fe069 | it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting . So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that"
"[35:15] fe069 | moves along . Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line ."
[35:16] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:26] fe008 | the transcript screen ,"
"[35:28] fe008 | and then you have a bar . I think you 're referring to this bar , aren't you ? And then there 's like this little resolution changer ."
[35:30] fe069 | I think Yeah .
[35:32] fe069 | Yeah . It 's Yeah .
"[35:33] fe008 | And then down here you have the soundwave , and then something down here , and then you got the cha the different channels come out ."
[35:35] fe069 | Exactly .
[35:36] me070 | Oh .
[35:43] fe069 | Yeah .
[35:44] me070 | Oh that ! Yeah .
[35:45] fe008 | you saying that there 's an arrow right here ?
[35:46] fe069 | Yeah !
[35:47] fe008 | OK . And then there 's an arrow right here ?
[35:47] fe069 | Yeah .
[35:48] fe069 | Yeah .
[35:49] fe008 | OK .
[35:50] fe069 | Exactly .
"[35:54] fe066 | I usually just don't use that , I think ."
[35:56] fe067 | Mmm .
[35:58] me070 | been able to use that cuz it I s feel like it skips such huge
"[36:00] fe069 | Maybe we have resolution set totally different . Cuz I noticed when Jen and I have totally different resolutions , cuz hers"
[36:00] fe067 | Yeah .
[36:02] me070 | portions . Maybe we do .
[36:06] fe066 | I tend to make it move fast .
"[36:07] fe069 | moves so much quicker than mine ,"
"[36:09] fe069 | which means it 's more stretched out , right ?"
[36:10] me070 | I wouldn't use that unless I was trying to get to a whole
[36:10] fe066 | Right . Right . Right . Right .
"[36:12] fe069 | Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um ,"
[36:14] fe068 | Right . That 's when I use it too .
[36:15] me070 | Yeah .
[36:16] fe069 | point five second intervals on the numbers .
[36:19] fe066 | Hmm .
"[36:19] fe008 | Oh . That 's interesting . I haven't paid attention to the numbers . I sort of like visually , i"
[36:23] fe008 | it helps me to have it be separated enough that I could find a new breaking point if I needed it .
[36:25] fe069 | Yeah .
[36:26] fe066 | Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out .
"[36:31] fe069 | too for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that"
[36:32] fe008 | Expanded ?
[36:36] fe069 | there 's a break in between
[36:40] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:41] fe066 | Oh , yes ."
[36:41] fe069 | I don't know .
"[36:42] fe066 | Because the , uh the waveform becomes too stretched out ."
[36:45] fe069 | Yeah .
[36:45] fe066 | Right . Because Yeah .
"[36:45] fe069 | So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter , but I 'll stretch I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something ."
[36:46] fe066 | It 's nice to have Right .
"[36:49] fe066 | A sort of , like , happy medium , so you can make sure that the waveform has its , like , th g shape . Yeah ."
"[36:50] me070 | Uh , right . Mm - hmm ."
[36:53] fe069 | Yeah .
[36:54] fe069 | Yeah .
[36:55] fe066 | Now I know what you 're talking about .
[36:55] fe069 | Yeah .
"[36:56] fe069 | That 's kind of interesting , though ."
[36:57] fe066 | Yeah .
"[36:59] fe008 | Well , we 're coming kind of close to the end of our time here . Um ,"
[37:06] fe069 | Well if there 's any left we can grab it .
"[37:08] fe068 | If there was pie again , if there was those tarts again ,"
"[37:10] fe069 | Ooh , those were good ."
[37:11] me070 | Hmm .
[37:14] fe069 | Yeah .
"[37:15] fe008 | Yeah , there 's some Those are those are nice ."
[37:15] fe068 | I 'm not a big ice cream fan .
[37:17] fe066 | Really ? Oh .
[37:18] fe068 | Nah .
"[37:20] fe008 | But I did I was thinking i you know , it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings , and"
"[37:27] fe008 | yet ,"
"[37:27] fe008 | i i it 's intriguing to me to think that if I were to describe someone 's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns , I bet you ,"
[37:35] fe008 | we would all agree on who it who it was . You know . I think that 's so interesting .
[37:36] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[37:38] fe069 | Yeah .
[37:38] me070 | Yeah .
"[37:39] fe008 | Yeah , it 's it 's a statement of speaker style , of course , but ."
[37:42] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:45] fe069 | I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of , and"
"[37:50] fe069 | can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever , or You know ?"
[37:55] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:57] fe069 | Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool ."
"[38:01] fe069 | Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface ."
[38:05] me070 | Yeah .
[38:06] fe066 | Right .
[38:07] fe069 | I don't know .
"[38:07] fe008 | Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings ? Things that you I mean , we di we talked briefly about this last time ."
"[38:12] fe068 | When people get really loopy , and start telling lots of"
"[38:16] fe068 | jokes , I think . I enjoy always transcribing those sections ."
"[38:24] fe068 | It 's yeah , it seems to be more at the end ."
[38:24] fe066 | Eah . Depends on the person .
"[38:26] fe067 | Or in the beginning , the very beginning ."
"[38:28] fe068 | Yeah , yeah . Yeah , they 'll be joking around ."
[38:28] me070 | Yeah .
[38:28] fe008 | OK .
"[38:29] fe066 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[38:30] fe069 | Yeah .
"[38:37] fe068 | Wait , a favorite what ?"
"[38:43] fe068 | Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like like , um ,"
"[38:46] fe068 | Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo Like , those groups ?"
[38:51] fe068 | Oh .
"[38:53] fe069 | I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related , cuz it 's more interesting for me ."
[38:57] fe066 | Yeah .
[38:57] fe008 | OK .
[38:58] me070 | Yeah . I like those .
[39:01] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:02] fe069 | Exactly . And it 's f really hard t t
[39:09] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:09] me070 | Yeah .
"[39:09] fe066 | So I 'm going "" OK . "" "" I 'm just gonna listen to you . """
[39:12] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[39:17] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:18] fe008 | Those are th E - would these be the EDU meetings ? That 's what I think . Is that true ?
"[39:21] fe066 | The ones with Liz , and you ."
[39:23] me070 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[39:23] fe008 | Oh , really ? OK ."
[39:23] fe066 | Yeah .
"[39:24] fe069 | Yeah . You guys do some in the mee in the Meeting Recorder ones , there 's some talk of ,"
"[39:29] fe069 | D d I don't know , discourse stuff . I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription ."
"[39:34] fe008 | Oh , I I 'm really ? Oh , I 'm glad ."
"[39:35] fe069 | Yeah . Cuz there are always people like ,"
"[39:38] fe069 | you know , talking bad about the transcribers , and just making fun of u And so it 's really funny , I don't know . It 's really funny to listen to ."
[39:41] fe066 | Yeah .
[39:42] fe066 | Yeah .
[39:42] fe066 | I li that 's why I like Johno .
[39:43] fe068 | I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers . No !
"[39:45] fe066 | Really ? Oh , it 's so funny . Yeah ."
"[39:46] fe008 | Oh , Johno does a lot of that ."
"[39:47] fe068 | When you guys were saying that last week , I was like"
[39:49] fe066 | That 's why I like listening to him . He 's always making fun of transcribers .
"[39:50] fe068 | "" Never heard that . """
"[39:55] fe066 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[39:55] fe069 | Yeah .
"[40:04] fe008 | Did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing , um , clicks like from African languages ? Wasn't that a kick ?"
[40:08] fe068 | Yes .
[40:08] me070 | Oh my .
[40:08] fe066 | Oh my god ! No .
[40:09] fe068 | I did that .
[40:10] fe008 | That was really a kick .
"[40:12] fe068 | He was it I you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy , he was making these funky sounds and making funny whistles ,"
[40:17] fe008 | Yeah .
[40:19] fe008 | Yep .
[40:19] fe068 | and you must have been sitting next to him cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it .
[40:20] fe008 | I was . Exactly .
[40:23] fe008 | Exactly so . Exactly .
"[40:23] fe068 | And he was like , "" Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears cuz I can whistle so high . """
[40:29] fe069 | Wow .
"[40:30] fe068 | And you were like , w "" That 's fascinating . "" I remember that meeting . I thought it was pretty funny ."
"[40:36] fe069 | I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too . I think those are interesting ."
[40:38] fe068 | Yeah .
[40:40] fe068 | Yeah .
[40:41] fe069 | And I think it 's really cool when people
[40:43] fe069 | start getting really excited about something or angry about something because then they tend to
[40:46] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:51] fe069 | I don't know . I mean , I remember one where"
"[40:54] fe069 | one person , um , was really trying to get something out , really , really desperately , and he kept getting interrupted by like three p three other people , and he was like ,"
"[41:02] fe069 | "" I I I I I I I I I "" And it was I mean it was"
"[41:07] fe069 | kind of sad but it was , like , also really interesting to watch , or to listen to ."
[41:12] fe069 | Both .
[41:12] fe008 | Have have you noticed that sometimes you have these
[41:18] fe069 | Yeah .
[41:19] fe066 | Yeah .
[41:19] fe067 | Mmm .
[41:21] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[41:22] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:23] fe069 | They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something , and it just n"
[41:23] fe008 | it 's difficult .
[41:28] fe069 | falls apart .
[41:29] me070 | Yeah .
"[41:40] fe066 | I uh , you know . It 's just it 's just kind of cute because everybody 's like , "" Oh . Well , OK . """
[41:40] fe069 | Yeah .
[41:45] fe069 | Yeah .
[41:51] fe069 | Yep .
[41:52] fe008 | Thank you .
[41:53] fe008 | Yeah .
"[41:54] fe008 | Let 's see . Have you noti th one of the things that I found is is ,"
"[41:57] fe008 | um , surprisingly difficult these days is to co is to get certain electronic sounds , to try and describe them . Have I was thinking about that the other day , it was like it 's like ,"
"[42:05] fe008 | y y you know ,"
[42:13] fe067 | Hmm .
[42:14] fe008 | What is that ? It 's not a beep .
[42:15] fe069 | Yeah .
[42:16] fe008 | It 's not a bell .
"[42:21] fe008 | so , it 's like , it 's a "" tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop "" ."
[42:29] fe067 | I wonder if like Microsoft has a word for it .
[42:30] fe066 | Now I 'm now I 'm just wondering how they 're gonna transcribe you saying that .
"[42:47] fe008 | Yeah . Well and then , you know , there are these other things that I think are really interesting , like the vocal changes in character ."
"[42:53] fe008 | People shifting into a kind of a comic voice , or sort of a mock - this or mock - that , you know , the sighing and"
[42:53] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[42:55] fe068 | Mmm .
[42:55] fe067 | Mmm .
[42:55] me070 | Mmm .
[43:01] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:04] fe008 | uh , which we use"
[43:05] fe008 | very often .
[43:07] fe008 | Comic words and things like that . And Yeah ?
"[43:10] fe069 | You know , I"
[43:10] fe067 | Huh .
"[43:11] fe069 | sorry , to I just remembered one thing that really was you needed I think it was you that pointed out"
[43:11] fe008 | Yeah .
"[43:17] fe069 | the problem . Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly , the noise . I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise ,"
"[43:25] fe008 | "" Eech - eech "" , or something ."
[43:27] fe069 | he was like pretending to r screw something into his head ? Was that what it was ?
[43:28] fe008 | s s
[43:30] fe008 | Yes . It was one of these it was this kind of deal .
"[43:30] me070 | Oh yeah , I had that one . Oh yeah ."
"[43:33] fe008 | Yes . Oh , yes . And he got to transcribe this meeting ."
"[43:37] me070 | Yeah , that was fun ."
[43:44] fe069 | Uh - huh .
[43:44] me070 | Yeah .
"[43:45] fe008 | "" Whee - whee "" . is what he said ."
[43:49] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[44:05] fe066 | Aw !
[44:06] fe069 | Oh .
[44:07] fe069 | Oh wow .
"[44:18] me070 | u u I had yeah , I had one like that too ."
[44:19] fe068 | Yeah !
[44:19] fe067 | Hmm .
[44:19] fe069 | That was really hard .
[44:22] fe069 | Yeah .
[44:22] fe069 | That 's really interesting .
[44:23] me070 | Yeah .
"[44:31] me070 | they were just describing the word over and over again , and just the q the quotes around the word were driving me crazy . When they kn knowing"
[44:37] me070 | when to put the quotes and when And then they were talking about like the difference between
"[44:41] me070 | "" uh "" when it 's "" a "" or when it 's "" uh "" , and at some point they were saying it so much , I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore . I was like , "" I don't know if you 're saying "" a "" or "" uh "" anymore "" ."
[44:43] fe069 | Yeah .
[44:49] fe069 | Yeah .
"[44:50] fe068 | Oh , yeah ."
[44:52] fe008 | You did an excellen excellent job .
"[44:54] fe008 | That was really it was like m transcription , a meta - transcription and meta meta meta . It 's really @ @ ."
"[44:54] me070 | Oh , thank you ."
[44:57] fe069 | Yeah .
[44:58] fe068 | Yeah . Cool !
[45:00] fe069 | Yeah .
"[45:00] fe008 | You know , I 'm really interested in this topic . Would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this ? Or do you need to g do people need to leave . I don't wanna keep you longer than Are we OK ?"
[45:07] me070 | I 'm fine .
[45:07] fe067 | I can stay .
"[45:08] fe069 | I don't have to be anywhere until five , so ."
[45:08] fe068 | Sure .
"[45:09] fe008 | Oh , OK . We won't be that long , I don't think . But but I really appreciate it ."
[45:10] fe068 | No .
[45:11] fe068 | Sure .
[45:11] me070 | OK .
[45:17] fe008 | the specific experiences of of having
[45:20] fe008 | encountered these data in this way .
"[45:26] fe068 | I mean , just weird things like"
"[45:36] fe068 | this was before we had the different channels , and , um , Dan Ellis it was when Dan Ellis was still here so it was like kind of early on , right ?"
[45:40] fe008 | Yes .
"[45:43] fe068 | And , um ,"
"[45:45] fe068 | everyone 's talking , and then all of the sudden , you hear"
[45:51] fe068 | Dan talking to someone else and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before .
"[45:55] fe068 | And and what he had done , is he had left the room to g"
[45:58] fe068 | He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him . And this is without the channelized interface . So you you have no idea . You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something . And they 're all like in they 're own r
"[45:59] fe066 | Oh , no ."
[46:05] fe069 | Oh man .
[46:05] me070 | Oh wow .
"[46:09] fe068 | world or something because Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine . And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s"
[46:13] fe066 | Oh g
"[46:15] fe068 | still in the room and what the heck 's he talking about ? But just sort of just weird things like that , and , um Yeah , he had just left the room and"
[46:17] me070 | Wow !
"[46:22] fe068 | gone and made a copy and he still had his microphone on , and then you could hear the the the r the women behind the desk talking to him , and just sort of stuff like that . It was just really bizarre ."
[46:31] fe068 | So .
[46:32] fe069 | That 's really funny .
[46:32] fe068 | Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that .
"[46:33] fe008 | Well , it is There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type , um , i when"
[46:37] fe008 | I was sitting here and we were doing This was like o one of the first meetings I ever participated in and and
"[46:42] fe008 | Dan was adjusting something here and Adam was in the next room , and ,"
"[46:46] fe008 | um , Adam says , "" So I 'll come in here and check the levels , "" and and"
[46:51] fe008 | he says something
[46:53] fe008 | and
"[46:54] fe008 | Dan says , "" No "" . And it sounds like he 's saying "" no "" to Adam , and it was w if if if so , this would have been extremely rude ."
[47:00] fe067 | Mmm .
[47:00] fe008 | But - but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because
"[47:03] fe008 | you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels ,"
[47:08] fe069 | Right .
[47:08] fe008 | you don't know that they 're not participating in the same conversation at all . It really is strange .
[47:11] fe069 | Yeah .
[47:14] fe068 | Yeah .
[47:15] fe008 | I it lead us it ta if we w
[47:16] fe068 | So .
"[47:17] fe008 | It is true that this is kind of an artificial and i um ,"
"[47:21] fe008 | discourse c aspect , the mixed channel is artificial because we 're boosting it in order to make everything audible ."
[47:26] fe069 | Yeah .
[47:26] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[47:26] fe067 | Hmm .
[47:36] fe008 | You mean when you leave here ? When you 're somewhere else ?
"[47:38] fe066 | No , no . While I while I 'm working here , it 's like nine o ' clock and nobody 's here except for me , and I 'm like , "" You know ,"
"[47:38] fe008 | No , no . OK ."
"[47:45] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
[47:58] fe066 | Takes a long time .
[47:59] fe068 | They take longer to do .
"[47:59] fe069 | It takes a long time , yeah ."
[47:59] fe067 | Mmm .
[48:00] fe008 | OK .
[48:00] me070 | Yeah .
"[48:00] fe068 | In a way they 're more fun , though ."
[48:02] fe069 | Yeah .
[48:02] fe068 | There 's just more variety .
"[48:03] fe069 | I tends I you know what I noticed , is it tends to have"
[48:08] fe067 | Mmm .
[48:08] fe066 | Yeah .
[48:14] fe067 | Yeah .
[48:15] fe069 | or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever . Yeah . Yeah . But I I think that
[48:21] fe069 | still overall you 're gonna have
[48:23] fe069 | probably three or four or five dominant
[48:25] fe069 | speakers .
"[48:26] fe066 | One thing I noticed is that , like , uhhh ! There was this one meeting I was transcribing , there were nine nine speakers ,"
"[48:31] fe066 | and by the end of it , I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again nine"
[48:36] fe069 | Yeah .
"[48:38] fe066 | times in slow - mo ! I was going nuts . I was like , "" I cannot take this anymore . I can't listen to this anymore . Oh my god ! """
[48:38] fe069 | Exactly .
[48:47] fe069 | Yeah .
[48:56] fe069 | Yeah .
"[49:01] fe069 | Oh , OK ."
[49:01] fe066 | Oh . OK .
"[49:01] fe068 | Did you guys ever , when This happened to me when I first started transcribing , cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before , but , um ,"
[49:07] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:09] fe068 | I would leave here , and I would go out and do my daily business , and I would hear people speaking to me , and I would transcribe them in my head !"
[49:15] fe066 | Yeah .
"[49:17] fe066 | Yes ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh yeah ."
[49:18] fe068 | I 'd imagine what I would type .
[49:20] fe069 | Yeah ! Yeah .
[49:20] fe067 | Mmm .
"[49:21] fe068 | It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks , but it was just bizarre ."
[49:22] fe066 | Yeah .
[49:24] me070 | Oh really ? I still do that .
[49:24] fe066 | I still do that . I still do that . Yeah .
[49:26] fe068 | Really ?
[49:27] fe069 | Occasionally . Like on the bus or something when I 'm bored .
[49:27] me070 | Yeah .
"[49:30] fe067 | Right . It 's something you 're not interacting with , you 're just listening ."
"[49:30] fe068 | Oh . No , for me it was unconscious . It was I didn't"
"[49:32] fe069 | Oh , really ?"
"[49:33] fe068 | mean for to be doing it . It would just intru it was an intrusion . Um , not a te not a bad intrusion , but"
"[49:34] fe069 | Oh , OK ."
"[49:35] fe066 | No , yeah . N Yeah ."
"[49:35] me070 | Oh , oh ."
[49:36] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:37] fe069 | Oh , that 's funny ."
[49:39] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[49:39] fe069 | Yeah .
"[49:42] fe069 | Huh , that 's interesting ."
[49:42] fe066 | I would also be really aw aware of w how I was speaking .
[49:42] me070 | Hmm .
[49:46] fe068 | Yes !
"[49:46] fe066 | Cuz I also tend Like , we were talking about "" so "" . I do that ."
[49:50] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:50] fe066 | I 'll end utterances with "" so "" or "" and "" ."
[49:52] fe069 | Yeah .
"[49:53] fe066 | and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , "" Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . """
[49:57] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[49:57] fe067 | Mmm .
[49:58] fe068 | Yeah !
"[50:01] fe068 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[50:02] fe066 | I 'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idios idiosyncratic , and"
[50:09] fe069 | Yeah .
[50:10] fe069 | I noticed a lot of my speech i
"[50:14] fe069 | I don't know , I wouldn't call them errors , I guess disfluencies ,"
[50:16] fe069 | a lot more once when I started transcribing .
"[50:19] fe069 | I just noticed and in ge people in general , that people"
[50:19] fe067 | Mmm .
[50:23] fe066 | Right .
[50:23] fe068 | Yeah .
[50:24] fe069 | break up their speech interestingly .
[50:25] me070 | Mmm .
[50:26] fe066 | I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate .
[50:28] fe069 | Yeah !
"[50:30] fe066 | You know ? Cuz people will say just , like , you know , monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things , and it means something ."
"[50:36] fe069 | I think that shows a lot of I think that shows a lot of how , um ,"
"[50:40] fe069 | it 's not all acoustic . I mean , there 's other things involved , eye contact , body language , gesture , whatever ."
[50:42] fe066 | Right .
[50:44] fe066 | Right .
[50:45] me070 | Right .
"[50:46] fe008 | That raises a question . Um , do you think that , um , you would have been considerably"
[50:51] fe008 | helped if we had had video tapes of these things ?
[50:53] fe068 | Oh sure .
[50:53] fe066 | Yes .
[50:54] fe069 | Yeah .
[50:54] fe008 | OK .
[50:55] fe069 | I definitely think so .
"[51:01] fe008 | Mmm , well , mm - hmm , mm - hmm that 's right , cuz you 're involved in gesture research . Mm - hmm ."
[51:01] fe066 | Uh - huh .
[51:04] fe069 | Yeah .
[51:12] fe066 | Yeah .
"[51:12] fe069 | which kind of comes into play , maybe not for speech recognition , but for other things , maybe ?"
[51:18] fe066 | Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind .
"[51:21] fe008 | Mmm - hmm . Oh , interesting ."
[51:21] me070 | Hmm .
[51:23] fe069 | Maybe .
[51:23] fe068 | Hmm .
[51:24] fe008 | Huh .
[51:25] fe068 | Yeah .
[51:26] me070 | Hmm .
[51:26] fe066 | No no visual input at all .
[51:31] fe066 | Right .
[51:33] fe066 | And you get so much more aware of all of it too .
[51:35] fe069 | Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe .
[51:35] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[51:36] fe067 | Hmm .
[51:36] me070 | Yeah .
"[51:37] fe008 | I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator . I mean , there 's a there 's a blind man in this in this building , and and ,"
[51:41] fe069 | Oh .
[51:43] fe069 | Uh - huh .
"[51:52] fe008 | uh , and then she then she said something and he says ,"
"[51:54] fe008 | "" Y you sp you 've changed your perfume . "" Yeah , it 's pretty interesting . Pretty interesting ."
[51:56] fe066 | Oh wow .
[51:58] me070 | Huh .
[51:59] fe069 | That 's pretty amazing .
"[51:59] fe068 | Had she changed her perfume ? Oh , wow ."
[51:59] fe066 | That 's neat .
"[52:00] fe008 | Yes , she had ."
[52:01] fe008 | Yeah .
[52:02] fe066 | Huh .
[52:02] me070 | Hmm .
[52:02] fe008 | Yeah .
[52:03] fe008 | Yeah .
[52:04] fe067 | Hmm .
[52:04] fe008 | It 's very interesting .
"[52:05] fe069 | Enhanced other senses , I guess . That 's really cool ."
[52:07] fe066 | Right .
[52:09] fe008 | Have you I I 've learned several things about having been
"[52:12] fe008 | Wi - i with the close - talking mikes . This is this is a new experience . Cuz I have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while , but"
[52:18] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[52:18] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:18] fe008 | th there are several things I didn't realize you could hear so reliably , and some of these are the things like"
[52:26] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[52:26] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[52:26] fe067 | Uh - huh .
[52:29] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[52:29] fe069 | Yeah .
[52:30] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[52:31] me070 | Yeah .
"[52:33] fe069 | That 's something you don't hear in normal speech too . In normal conversations , unless it 's very dramatic or very loud ,"
[52:33] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[52:34] fe008 | it 's that tangible .
[52:41] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[52:48] fe069 | Yeah .
"[52:48] fe067 | the levels are funny . Then you hear it . So , th it 's kind of like that ."
[52:50] fe069 | Yeah .
[52:50] fe066 | Right .
[52:51] fe069 | Yeah .
"[52:52] fe008 | I guess it 's also one of these things that u usually is not meaningful , so we sort of screen it out ."
"[52:56] fe008 | u all these different in cuz , you know , I mean , we do that all the time with all other well , lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal ."
[52:58] me070 | Right .
[53:02] fe069 | Yeah .
[53:02] fe068 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[53:10] fe008 | The contour is really not nearly that neat .
[53:12] fe008 | Yeah .
[53:12] fe066 | Yeah .
"[53:12] fe068 | Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist . Not literally what people are saying and so ,"
[53:17] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[53:17] fe067 | Mmm .
"[53:19] fe068 | you know , all the "" uh "" "" uh 's "" and "" um 's "" , and all those different things , we just tune it out , yeah ."
[53:20] fe066 | That 's true .
"[53:21] fe069 | We - yeah , we filter all that out . Yeah ."
[53:23] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[53:24] fe068 | And , uh , it 's that top - down thing again . Just right ? In a way . Just trying to get the , um ,"
"[53:27] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah , absolutely . Absolutely ."
"[53:29] fe068 | you know , what is the p"
"[53:31] fe068 | "" what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate ? "" kind of thing . So ."
[53:33] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[53:33] fe008 | That 's right .
[53:34] fe067 | Hmm .
[53:35] fe008 | That 's right .
"[53:38] fe069 | before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription , how I tended to look all conversations , and then"
"[53:46] fe069 | coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally"
[53:50] fe069 | more intense way . Um .
"[53:54] fe069 | Including , I mean , every little aspect ."
"[53:56] fe069 | I and when I tell people what I do here ,"
"[53:59] fe069 | and tell them , "" Yeah , I 'm transcribing "" . And they 're they think I 'm like a stenographer or something ."
[54:03] fe066 | Right .
[54:03] fe068 | Yeah .
"[54:03] fe069 | I 'm like , "" No , I don't correct the grammar . I don't erase the "" um "" 's and "" uh "" 's , I record all the sighs , and the laughs , and the breaths , and """
[54:11] fe069 | And they 're I don't know . This is a very different thing than
[54:14] fe069 | most people
"[54:15] fe069 | can relate to , I guess ."
"[54:17] fe008 | Mm - hmm . The I agree . Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is ,"
"[54:29] fe008 | when you hear it with the intonational markers , but well , just the contours , but"
[54:31] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:34] fe008 | the words on the page , it 's not at all clear . And there are a couple people who do this in particular . I I would say"
[54:36] fe069 | Yeah .
[54:36] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[54:43] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:45] fe008 | it 's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it ,"
[54:49] fe008 | but how very
[54:51] fe008 | complicated it is when you see the words . Yeah .
[54:53] fe069 | Yeah .
"[54:54] fe069 | And when you think about it , they pick up exactly where they left off ,"
[55:03] fe069 | We 're pretty amazing
[55:06] fe069 | machines .
"[55:07] fe069 | Or creatures , whatever ."
[55:07] fe008 | Hmm .
[55:08] me070 | Mmm .
[55:08] fe008 | Yeah .
[55:09] fe069 | That 's really cool .
[55:11] fe008 | Yeah .
"[55:14] fe008 | So , and then of course there are these these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data which are these funny sounds people make ,"
"[55:21] fe008 | which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk . So ,"
"[55:24] fe008 | I notice people going , "" Pfft "" you know , if they 're trying to"
[55:27] fe008 | say something is done . The Germans do this I think in particular .
[55:28] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[55:30] fe069 | Yeah .
[55:31] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[55:31] fe067 | Hmm .
"[55:31] fe008 | And there are others that we use like that th which are sort of semi - conventionalized , but you wouldn't think that you would write them down ."
[55:38] me070 | Yeah .
[55:41] fe008 | Oh yes ! Good example .
[55:41] fe067 | Mmm .
[55:42] fe069 | Mmm .
[55:44] fe069 | It 's like
[55:48] fe008 | Yes .
[55:50] me070 | Yeah .
"[55:50] fe066 | some sort of like , "" Well , there it is "" ."
[55:52] fe069 | Yeah .
"[55:52] fe066 | Or , "" That 's it . "" Or something like that , you know ."
[55:52] me070 | Yeah .
"[55:55] fe066 | That people do that one a lot . And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly . And after a while ,"
[56:01] fe066 | I started getting confused as to whether or not
"[56:04] fe066 | he was , like ,"
[56:09] fe066 | or whether he was meaning it in conversat Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue .
[56:14] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:17] fe066 | But then sometimes it was more ambiguous . Like it was tough to tell ,"
"[56:23] fe008 | This cou Is this the one that I mean , it could be the one that we were thinking about ."
[56:26] fe069 | It could be .
[56:27] fe069 | But I
[56:28] fe069 | noticed it more as it was obviously
[56:38] fe008 | Yes . Uh - huh .
"[56:38] fe069 | And so it wasn't ever like a ,"
[56:39] fe066 | Mmm .
"[56:41] fe069 | um ,"
"[56:41] fe066 | Oh , OK ."
[56:42] fe069 | single
"[56:43] fe066 | Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones ."
[56:43] fe069 | l
[56:45] fe069 | Yeah .
"[56:45] fe008 | Oh , how interesting ."
"[56:46] fe066 | Yeah , just kind of , um And , uh that 's another thing like I I realize I do that too ."
[56:52] me070 | Hmm .
[56:53] fe066 | I can't remember the name actually .
[56:54] fe008 | OK .
"[56:55] fe008 | The the one that I 'm thinking of , i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , "" Do I have time to do this ? "" and he 's"
[57:00] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:02] fe008 | calculating it in his mind . So it 's sort of li almost like a stand - in for calculator , kind of thing ."
[57:06] fe067 | Hmm .
"[57:06] fe008 | And i uh , but it 's signaling . I 'm sure that everybody I 'm sure that other people can hear it . So it 's sort of like , "" Wait a minute , I 'm thinking . """
[57:12] fe069 | Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[57:12] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[57:14] me070 | Hmm .
[57:14] fe069 | That 's kind of the impression I got too .
"[57:16] fe066 | Oh . Yeah , that 's a different person ."
[57:17] fe008 | OK . OK . OK .
"[57:18] fe066 | Yeah . OK , I know who you 're talking about . But this is somebody somebody differ"
"[57:20] fe008 | He must do this in a lot of meetings because I think you know , I 've run across it several times ."
[57:22] me070 | I don't think I 've ever heard it .
[57:24] fe069 | No .
[57:24] fe068 | No .
[57:25] fe069 | Hmm .
[57:27] me070 | Yeah .
[57:27] fe008 | Yeah .
"[57:27] fe068 | Which I just transcribe as "" mouth "" ."
[57:28] fe008 | Heard that one .
"[57:30] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
"[57:30] fe068 | I just make a mouth Cuz I think I had talked to you about this about what what did we do cuz wha what was it that I oh , I was "" Lipsmack "" !"
[57:32] me070 | Huh .
[57:39] fe069 | Yeah .
[57:39] fe008 | Oh yes .
[57:39] fe066 | Yeah .
"[57:44] fe068 | yeah , that 's It 's a different noise , but , um , it 's what made me think of it , but , um ,"
[57:44] me070 | Hmm .
[57:45] fe069 | Yeah .
[57:48] fe066 | The one you 're talking ab
"[57:49] fe068 | and and you said , "" Don't do "" lipsmack "" , just do we don't need it 's too specific . Just do "" mouth "" for all tha all those noises "" ."
[58:02] fe008 | beyond just the p
[58:03] fe008 | mouth opening and the
"[58:06] fe008 | w oh , you know , the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak ,"
[58:10] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[58:10] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[58:10] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[58:11] fe008 | then I would like to have it if it 's communicative , I 'd like to have it preserved ."
[58:14] me070 | Right .
"[58:15] fe008 | a But if it 's just this mechanical stuff , "" mouth "" is fine ."
[58:17] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[58:18] fe008 | The It seems like the computer science people use "" lipsmack "" for that ."
"[58:24] fe008 | eh , w we 've we 're still deciding on how we 're gonna encode it in the final version ."
"[58:27] fe008 | But I tend to not like "" lipsmack "" because I think that that 's could be meaningful and it 's a little confusing ."
[58:32] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[58:33] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[58:33] fe008 | People talk about , you know , "" Oh gee , that was really good , "" and then they do a I 'm not gonna do it cuz I don't really know how to do lipsmack . But but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture , a definite type of thing ."
[58:33] fe067 | Mmm .
[58:38] fe068 | Yeah .
[58:39] fe069 | It could be .
[58:40] fe069 | Yeah .
[58:44] fe008 | Yes .
[58:48] fe008 | Same here . Yeah . I would too .
"[58:48] fe066 | You know , like , uh , as though they 're like , you know , trying to communicate displeasure ."
[58:49] me070 | Yeah .
"[58:49] fe068 | Oh , right ."
[58:51] fe068 | Yeah .
[58:52] fe067 | Hmm .
[58:53] me070 | That 's true . Yeah .
[58:53] fe068 | Right .
[58:53] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[58:54] fe066 | And so that Yeah .
[58:55] fe067 | Mmm .
"[58:56] fe066 | U i cu there 's there 's at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different . You know , there 's like ,"
[59:01] fe068 | Right .
"[59:09] fe008 | I would say "" tongue click "" for that . But I would also probably put in parentheses it that I thought it was a vocal gesture . Because I think it 's communicative of a certain thing ."
[59:10] fe066 | Yeah .
[59:14] fe066 | Uh - huh .
[59:16] me070 | Yeah .
[59:18] fe066 | Yeah .
[59:27] fe069 | Oh yeah .
[59:27] fe008 | Oh . Good point . Yes .
"[59:30] fe069 | It 's like "" humph "" ."
[59:31] fe008 | Really good point . Yeah .
[59:35] fe008 | I would too . I think it 's more emphatic .
[59:36] me070 | Yeah ?
"[59:38] me070 | Mm - hmm . W what about pre transcribing it , um ,"
[59:38] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[59:39] fe008 | But it th it 's true that th segments are different too .
"[59:41] me070 | "" HMPH "" ? What about transcribing it that way , like "" hmph "" ?"
"[59:44] fe066 | "" Hmph . """
[59:44] fe067 | Hmm !
[59:45] fe068 | Oh .
"[59:45] fe008 | Well , now , y This is a good question . I guess I would say th you know , sometimes we 've seen "" hmph "" in literature meaning in but it 's a s"
[59:51] me070 | Right .
"[59:53] fe008 | a sigh a si uh , sorry . A sound of indignation ."
[59:56] me070 | Right .
[59:56] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[59:56] fe008 | So , if it 's meant as a sound of indignation then I think that would be how I would capture it , with the HMPH thing ."
[00:00] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:05] fe069 | Hhh . not indignation . Something more positive . I don't know exactly wha how to characterize it , but something more"
[00:10] fe066 | Oh really ?
"[00:11] fe008 | a sort of like a sup uh , an uh , an elevated "" hmm "" ? It 's like a m sort of more surprise , or"
[00:12] me070 | Right .
[00:13] fe067 | Yeah .
[00:16] fe069 | Yeah . Or I i I don't know . Maybe .
[00:17] fe008 | engagement ?
"[00:18] me070 | I yeah . I guess it could have two meanings , sort of ."
[00:21] fe069 | Yeah .
"[00:22] fe068 | If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too ."
[00:24] fe069 | Yeah .
[00:24] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[00:29] fe068 | Hmm .
[00:30] fe069 | Yeah .
[00:31] me070 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
"[00:32] fe008 | I would just say "" laugh "" for that ."
[00:33] fe066 | Laugh . Right .
[00:33] fe069 | Yeah .
[00:34] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:34] fe068 | Yeah , once , Adam was laughing , and it was actually written out"
"[00:38] fe068 | phonetically , and I changed it . I 'm like "" it 's just laughing "" ."
[00:40] fe008 | Good .
[00:41] fe069 | Yeah .
[00:41] fe008 | Well done . Well done .
"[00:42] fe068 | Like somebody had written , like"
"[00:47] fe008 | I 've run across that also . And Right . Change it to "" laugh "" . Well done ."
"[00:50] fe068 | Yeah , i I it was maybe Tigerfish had done something like they had written out a phonetic laugh , and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript . It was just that one spot ."
"[00:53] fe066 | Yeah , yeah ."
[00:55] fe066 | That 's interesting .
[00:57] fe069 | That 's interesting .
"[00:57] fe008 | I ran across a couple "" ho "" 's occ"
"[00:58] fe068 | It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know . It wasn't anything special ."
"[01:00] fe008 | and "" heh "" . Yeah ."
"[01:02] fe069 | I noticed , i m as far as problems with laughs , is that a lot of them were marked as breaths ."
[01:04] fe008 | @ @
"[01:07] fe069 | Because a lot of people ,"
[01:09] fe008 | Yes .
[01:10] me070 | Right .
[01:10] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:11] fe069 | but not so much as , I never saw that written out phonetically , or whatever ."
[01:11] fe008 | Well i
"[01:15] fe068 | well , here 's a question , and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at ."
"[01:20] fe068 | When OK . So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air , and so you need to i inhale ,"
[01:25] fe008 | Yes .
[01:27] fe068 | and so how do you transcribe the inhale ? Some people are transcribing it as a breath .
"[01:32] fe068 | I I used to ,"
"[01:34] fe068 | you know , back in the day back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh because to me the breath is part of the laugh ."
"[01:35] fe008 | Yeah ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ?"
"[01:39] fe069 | Yeah , that 's what I used to do too ."
"[01:39] fe008 | Uh - huh . Yeah , yeah ."
[01:41] fe008 | I agree with you . That 's that 's what I prefer .
[01:41] me070 | Oh yeah .
[01:41] fe066 | Yeah .
[01:42] fe067 | Mmm .
"[01:42] fe068 | Um , so cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath , and I 've been taking them out ."
[01:43] me070 | Yeah .
"[01:49] fe069 | So you would have like "" lef"
[01:49] fe008 | Good .
[01:50] fe008 | Well done .
[01:50] fe068 | So that 's OK ?
[01:51] fe008 | Well done .
"[01:53] fe068 | Actually , it 'd be a "" laugh "" and then two dots , like the next bin will be empty , and then it 'll be "" breath "" ."
[01:53] fe069 | transcribed ?
[01:57] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:58] fe069 | Oh , I 've Yeah . OK . I see what you 're saying ."
[01:58] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[01:59] me070 | Oh .
[02:00] fe068 | it 'll be three d
[02:01] fe068 | sort of separate units as opposed to I think it 's sort of one coherent thing . So .
[02:02] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:04] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:04] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:05] fe066 | I put "" breath - laugh "" in the brackets when I don't know whether it 's a breath or a laugh , which is what I remember you telling me to do that ."
[02:08] fe008 | That 's good . That 's good .
[02:08] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:09] fe068 | Oh , well , yeah , that 's that 's a different thing ."
[02:10] fe008 | That 's right .
[02:11] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:11] fe067 | Mmm . OK .
[02:11] fe068 | Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's
[02:12] fe008 | That 's good .
[02:13] fe069 | Sometimes it 's hard to tell .
[02:14] fe067 | Yeah .
[02:15] fe066 | Right .
[02:15] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:16] me070 | Yeah .
[02:16] fe066 | Right .
"[02:16] fe068 | Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them and say that they 're laughing ."
[02:16] fe067 | Hmm .
[02:19] fe008 | I agree with you . And and I think that 's important because we 're capturing then the communicative level .
[02:19] fe066 | Right .
[02:20] me070 | Yeah .
[02:23] fe069 | Yeah . Exactly .
[02:23] fe068 | Mm - hmm . Exactly .
[02:24] me070 | Right .
[02:24] fe008 | And it 's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well .
"[02:28] fe008 | Because it 's sort of expulsive and and , uh , that kind of thing . Ex - exactly . Exactly . Well done ."
[02:28] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[02:31] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[02:31] fe069 | Yeah .
[02:32] fe069 | Yeah .
"[02:33] fe066 | A lot of people go ,"
[02:33] fe068 | So .
"[02:34] fe008 | Yes they do . Yeah , the shyer ones sometimes will laugh i with the breath - laugh . And you can see it . You can see the little little peaks , which is interesting . But yes . Yeah , exactly ."
[02:38] fe066 | Right .
[02:39] fe066 | Right .
[02:40] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[02:40] fe068 | Right .
"[02:43] fe008 | I wouldn't , uh i That 's a case whe you know , I know generally with the Tigerfish things that they put "" breath "" and we leave it in . But absolutely there , yeah . "" Laugh "" ,"
[02:50] fe068 | Good . OK .
"[02:52] fe008 | change it . And , you know , there are other places where it 's in the way , you know ."
"[03:02] me070 | results of bad segmentation , and there 's a segmentation of nothing , and so they"
[03:05] fe008 | Oh yes !
"[03:07] me070 | just write it as a breath when it 's clearly not a breath . And I usually always take those out . I mean , usually ,"
[03:09] fe069 | Yeah . I 've taken out some of those .
[03:10] fe068 | Yeah .
"[03:13] me070 | um , it seems like the segmenter , um , often"
[03:14] fe008 | Great .
[03:29] me070 | So usually I take those out .
[03:29] fe008 | That 's right .
[03:30] fe069 | Yeah .
"[03:31] fe068 | Well they give the segmenter , though cuz they don't have the the rich"
"[03:34] fe068 | interface that we do , so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt , "" Well , there must be something there ,"
"[03:38] me070 | Right . Right . Exactly , exactly ."
"[03:40] fe068 | um , whether I can hear it or not . "" So , they just say , "" Well , it 's a breath then "" ."
"[03:40] fe069 | Oh , yeah . I 'm sure they are ."
[03:41] me070 | Exactly .
[03:44] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:44] fe069 | Although , they did put a "" missing segment """
[03:47] fe069 | so sometimes in brackets .
[03:47] fe068 | Yes !
"[03:48] me070 | Oh really ? Oh , I always get I always get "" breath "" ."
[03:48] fe068 | That 's true .
[03:49] fe008 | Yeah .
"[03:50] fe008 | Well , see , I I do a previous filtering before I give the Tigerfish ones out , and and I u"
[03:51] fe069 | I 've gotten both .
[03:54] fe069 | Uh - huh .
"[03:56] fe008 | I have tried to get the that particular the the "" missing segment "" removed . But I don't always"
[04:00] fe069 | Yeah .
[04:00] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:01] fe069 | Yeah . I 've seen a few of them , but I 've seen a several "" breath "" 's too ."
[04:01] fe068 | Hmm .
"[04:02] fe008 | do it . So yeah , you 've s they slip through ."
"[04:03] fe068 | Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice ."
[04:03] me070 | Hmm !
[04:05] fe069 | Yeah ! Yeah .
[04:06] fe068 | Cuz then you 'll hear you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one
[04:15] fe069 | Yeah .
"[04:17] fe068 | That person 's not talking at all "" . So , you just get rid of it ."
[04:19] fe069 | Yeah .
[04:20] fe069 | Yeah .
[04:20] me070 | Hmm .
[04:20] fe068 | So .
[04:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[04:23] fe008 | Interesting .
"[04:25] fe008 | OK , well , let 's see ,"
"[04:26] fe008 | so , um , do you think that this has changed your speech n"
"[04:32] fe008 | Myself , I do feel that I 'm when I spend a lot of hours doing this I become less fluent . I"
[04:37] fe069 | Really ?
[04:39] fe068 | Hmm !
"[04:44] fe066 | I guess I try to be more careful in my speech ,"
[04:47] fe066 | more often .
[04:48] fe008 | Good .
"[04:49] fe066 | Unless I 'm really not paying any attention like , you know , if I 'm at a party or something , and I 'm just"
"[04:54] fe066 | sort of having a good time , then it doesn't really matter , but"
[05:00] fe066 | I think I tend to
[05:03] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[05:04] fe066 | Cuz I 've been told I mumble .
[05:06] fe008 | Oh ! Huh !
"[05:06] fe066 | Um ,"
[05:08] fe066 | and I guess I used to be worse about it . I was
[05:14] fe069 | Uh - huh .
"[05:14] fe066 | Uh ,"
[05:15] fe066 | and also I I have this sort of
[05:25] fe008 | Hmm !
"[05:25] fe066 | A lot of times like , uh , if I 'm not paying attention I 'll say something"
"[05:29] fe066 | that ,"
"[05:29] fe066 | uh , will"
"[05:31] fe066 | not really be heard . I tend to leave off final consonants , for instance ,"
"[05:36] fe066 | and people , uh , n"
"[05:37] fe066 | I have to be conscious of that sometimes . Yeah , so ."
[05:39] fe008 | Hmm !
"[05:41] fe008 | So mainly for clarity , it sounds like , like in phrasing or strategies ."
[05:42] fe066 | Yeah .
[05:43] fe066 | Yeah .
[05:49] fe069 | I don't know if it 's a really a question of me being more c
"[05:52] fe069 | changing my speech necessarily , but I 'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation in normal conversation ."
[05:58] fe008 | Oh !
[05:59] fe008 | Oh .
[05:59] fe066 | Yeah .
"[06:00] fe069 | So , uh , maybe I am more careful in the sense that I"
"[06:03] fe069 | maybe don't interrupt as much , or j"
"[06:06] fe069 | I 'm more aware of it when I am doing it , or something like that , but ,"
"[06:10] fe069 | um , I just"
"[06:16] fe069 | pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions . There 's no I mean , unless you have really aw I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward ."
[06:25] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:25] fe069 | There would be a lot of pauses , and that would kind of i"
"[06:28] fe069 | imply uncomfortability , or something ."
[06:31] fe067 | Hmm .
[06:31] fe066 | Right .
[06:32] me070 | Yeah .
"[06:32] fe069 | But ,"
"[06:33] fe008 | I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption . I mean , if it 's a clarifying type like "" well do you mean ? "" when they 're partway through it in a utterance ."
[06:33] fe069 | yeah .
[06:35] fe069 | Yeah .
[06:40] fe069 | Yeah .
[06:41] fe069 | Yeah .
[06:43] fe069 | It 's different .
[06:43] fe066 | Yeah . I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as
[06:53] fe069 | Yeah .
"[06:56] fe066 | their little schpiel and people are meant to be ,"
"[07:00] fe066 | you know , pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part . And then they let them finish , and then somebody else comes in and says something about it ."
[07:07] fe069 | Yeah .
"[07:08] fe066 | Um ,"
[07:09] fe066 | and in a n like a friendly conversation I I notice that that 's not really true . Like what you were saying .
[07:15] me070 | Right .
[07:18] fe069 | even when it
"[07:32] fe069 | um ,"
"[07:32] fe069 | and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions ,"
"[07:37] fe069 | or e not enough overlaps , or something . It wasn't interruptions it was overlaps , that I was thinking about . Not enough overlaps . And so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more . And ch what she didn't realize was"
[07:38] fe066 | Huh !
[07:41] fe008 | Uh - huh . I think this is really yeah .
"[07:48] fe069 | that throughout the meeting up until then there had been ,"
"[07:50] fe069 | they were just very small , but they were there ."
[07:53] fe069 | I think they 're there pretty much a all the time .
"[07:55] fe008 | I agree . I did I did do one analysis wh where I looked at one meeting ,"
[07:57] fe066 | That 's interesting .
[07:59] fe069 | Uh - huh .
"[08:00] fe008 | and , um th cuz the claim had been , actually o one of the"
"[08:03] fe008 | people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that , "" Well , there probably the overlaps only occur during setup"
[08:12] fe069 | Oh !
"[08:13] fe068 | Oh yeah , that 's totally not true ."
[08:13] fe067 | Hmm !
"[08:14] fe066 | No , not at all ."
"[08:14] fe008 | Exactly . Exactly . Well , and , you know , I think that that 's sort of the feeling you would get if unless you looked at the data at this level . And so I did an analysis and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate"
[08:14] fe069 | Yeah !
[08:18] fe069 | Yeah !
[08:20] fe069 | Yeah .
[08:20] me070 | Right .
[08:23] fe069 | Yeah .
[08:23] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[08:24] fe008 | all the way through the entire meeting and everyone was involved .
[08:26] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:26] fe008 | Wasn't just one , you know , or two speakers . Everyone was Yeah . It 's quite true ."
[08:30] fe066 | Kind of makes sense because
[08:41] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[08:42] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[08:46] fe069 | Yeah .
"[08:48] fe066 | Oh , I see . Uh - huh ."
[08:50] me070 | Yeah .
"[08:51] me070 | I think , um , silences are generally like not good in conversation too . Cuz once you get a"
[08:55] fe008 | @ @
[09:10] fe069 | Yeah .
[09:11] fe067 | Hmm .
[09:13] fe069 | And then everybody talks at once .
[09:15] fe008 | That 's true . That 's very true .
[09:16] me070 | You know ? S
[09:18] fe069 | I I think I 've only noticed a couple times where there 's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time .
[09:23] me070 | Yeah .
[09:25] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[09:26] fe067 | Hmm !
[09:26] fe069 | It 's only been like twice . Yeah .
[09:26] fe068 | It 's rare .
[09:27] fe066 | Yeah .
[09:28] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[09:29] fe008 | Interesting observation .
"[09:38] fe008 | of standardization which I hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before , and , um ,"
"[09:44] fe008 | wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things . These are ,"
"[09:48] fe008 | Yeah , I don't think that these are very common . But with the idea that what we 're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff ,"
"[09:54] fe008 | um ,"
"[09:55] fe008 | when we have these grey areas , um ,"
"[09:59] fe008 | w um ,"
"[10:00] fe008 | I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought , and they 're coming out with a bunch of"
"[10:07] fe008 | segments , which really aren't part of a word ."
[10:09] fe008 | Have you run across that where they 're they 're saying @ @ and then they say a word .
[10:09] fe069 | Hmm .
[10:11] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:12] fe066 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[10:12] fe069 | Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[10:12] me070 | Yeah .
[10:13] fe067 | Oh .
[10:14] fe066 | Right .
[10:14] fe068 | Yeah .
"[10:14] fe008 | And , my feeling on that is , that"
[10:18] fe008 | this isn't really
"[10:19] fe008 | a phonological transcript ,"
"[10:20] fe008 | and potentially those things could probably be rendered , although some of them are not even full segments , they 're even sub s subsegmental , I would say . I mean , you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes , and ,"
[10:28] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:32] fe008 | you know , they 're th it 's like the the apparatus is sort of"
[10:40] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[10:43] fe066 | OK .
"[10:47] fe008 | is to I use in parentheses one "" X "" so it 's marked ."
[10:51] me070 | Right .
[10:52] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[10:54] fe069 | Then Right .
[10:55] me070 | That 's what I usually do too . Yeah .
[10:56] fe068 | I was wondering who had been putting those in .
[10:56] fe008 | Great .
"[10:58] fe008 | And then and then what I do is I put in , um , brackets , um ,"
"[11:02] fe008 | uncodeable Sorry , "" Uncodeable vocal sounds "" ."
[11:06] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[11:06] fe068 | Yes .
"[11:07] fe066 | Oh , OK . OK ."
"[11:08] fe008 | And of course , potentially they 're codable , but i I just wanted to mark roughly how man how long it is ,"
[11:14] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[11:14] fe008 | then indicate
"[11:15] fe008 | what what the nature of it is , so no one 's gonna try and go back and and decode it as something that 's pechen a a word that was not It has a different status than parenthesized ,"
"[11:25] fe008 | uh ,"
"[11:26] fe008 | parts when there are words involved ,"
[11:29] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:36] fe008 | that 's not necessary . It 's just sometimes it works out that way that they @ @ , they do this thing . I shouldn't do that so often . I 'm sorry about that . They do this sound ,"
[11:37] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:44] fe008 | and then there 's a pause , and then they start speaking , so then it 's really obvious , I can I can split it apart and it won't be any problem . I wanted to mention that one , yeah ."
[11:47] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[11:50] fe068 | Man !
[11:58] fe069 | Mmm .
[11:58] fe068 | I do that too ! I used to do that !
[12:05] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:05] fe066 | And so , I 'm glad you said that because , um , that actually takes"
[12:08] fe068 | A lot of time .
"[12:09] fe066 | a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration to d to do that . Um ,"
[12:10] me070 | Yeah .
[12:14] fe008 | Excellent .
"[12:20] fe066 | I do that if it 's unintelligible , but if I can tell something if somebody goes "" r """
"[12:25] fe066 | I 'll put an "" R "" ."
"[12:26] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[12:27] fe008 | I see .
"[12:28] fe066 | Eh Um , so if they go "" r e m m "" ,"
"[12:30] fe066 | I 'll go "" R "" "" EH "" "" mmm "" m "" M "" "" M "" ."
[12:34] me070 | Oh .
[12:35] fe067 | Hmm .
[12:35] fe066 | So like I I 've been doing that because like that 's what I can hear . And I 'm pretty damn sure that sorry . Sorry !
[12:37] fe008 | OK .
[12:39] me070 | Right .
"[13:10] fe068 | She 's pretty darn sure that , uh ,"
"[13:21] fe008 | Well , y you 've heard have you heard "" shoot "" ? I 've heard "" shoot "" a couple of times ."
[13:25] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:25] fe068 | Not the swearword version .
"[13:26] fe008 | No , no , no , no , no , no , the"
"[13:27] fe068 | Just "" shoot "" ."
"[13:28] fe008 | "" shoot "" type , yeah ."
[13:28] fe066 | I 've heard the swearword version . Remember that ? Remember that ? It was a while back . I it was a long time ago .
[13:29] me070 | Yeah .
[13:29] fe068 | That 's OK .
"[13:30] me070 | Oh , you have ? I 've never heard the swearword versions ."
[13:30] fe008 | Yeah ?
[13:31] fe008 | Oh .
[13:34] fe008 | I do remember that . Yeah .
"[13:34] fe066 | Yeah , and I was like , "" Oah ! "" I emailed you , I was like , "" M You might wanna check this out . "" Yeah , I do remember that . But it was very quiet . So I can see how that would have been sort of"
[13:39] fe008 | That 's right . That 's right . Yeah .
"[13:44] fe066 | gone over by accident . It was just very quiet , like kind of under the breath kind of thing , so that 's why it was missed . I can understand . Yeah ."
"[13:48] fe008 | Uh - huh , yeah . Yeah , it was ."
[13:48] fe069 | Uh - huh . Yeah . Yeah .
[13:50] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[13:50] fe068 | Hmm !
[13:50] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[13:50] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[13:52] fe008 | Yeah .
"[13:54] fe066 | Oh ! I was just I was just saying that , um , I I can I 'm pretty sure that I can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced . So if it 's"
[14:03] fe008 | Yes . Mm - hmm .
[14:04] me070 | Right .
[14:06] fe069 | Yeah .
[14:06] me070 | Right .
[14:07] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[14:07] me070 | Then again , I always think that it 's closer to stick with the "" X ""s because it 's , like ,"
"[14:12] me070 | how effective is , you know , the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make ."
[14:18] fe069 | Yeah .
"[14:18] me070 | You know , it 's not the IPA and it 's just , I I just sort of think , um ,"
[14:21] fe067 | Mmm .
"[14:26] me070 | y English orthography conventions are just so ,"
[14:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:34] me070 | you know , I I usually only use them when I I know that , um ,"
"[14:37] me070 | the person was trying to make a word . I mean , I know that the the word they were trying to say and that they were stuttering that , then I feel fine just"
"[14:44] me070 | you know , writing out the letters . But otherwise , I sort of don't"
[14:53] fe066 | Just not useful ?
[14:54] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[14:54] fe066 | Yeah ?
[14:56] fe069 | Yeah .
[14:57] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[14:57] fe068 | Right .
"[14:59] me070 | it was set up for a different purpose , you know . Not necessarily so phonological ."
"[15:02] fe008 | I agree . And I think there 's another problem too , and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative . And and sometimes So , if you have an"
[15:03] fe069 | Yeah .
[15:03] fe066 | OK .
"[15:10] fe008 | "" ER "" as part of one of these fragments , we do have a"
[15:16] fe066 | Right .
[15:16] fe008 | a filler item . Does have a meaning . So I think for both of the reasons it 's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word - like way .
[15:17] fe069 | Yeah .
[15:18] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[15:26] me070 | Right .
"[15:27] fe008 | I would keep "" er "" . Well , "" E "" "" er "" "" er "" if it 's a filler . So , "" I mean , er , """
"[15:28] fe066 | Oh , you would keep "" er "" ."
"[15:30] fe066 | Right , right ."
"[15:31] fe008 | th that that that stays . But if it 's p uh , part on these little fragments , no ."
"[15:31] fe066 | Right . Oh , OK ."
[15:32] fe069 | Yeah .
[15:35] me070 | I often transcribe that as
"[15:36] me070 | "" or "" . I always thought that was "" or "" sort of with a strange pronunciation ."
[15:40] fe008 | I 'm making a distinction .
[15:41] fe068 | Oh .
"[15:42] fe008 | So you have the , um , comic "" er "" where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't wanna say that , and then they throw in an "" er "" ."
[15:45] me070 | Right .
"[15:48] me070 | Oh . Oh , I don't get that one ."
"[15:49] fe008 | m and that would be an "" er "" . ER . But if they 're saying "" or """
[15:50] fe066 | Uh - huh .
[15:50] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[15:52] me070 | Right .
"[15:54] fe008 | in a reduced way so it comes out as "" er "" , do it as "" or "" ."
[15:56] me070 | R
[15:57] me070 | Right .
[15:58] me070 | OK . m OK .
"[15:58] fe008 | Cuz that 's that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants . It 's just like different ways of saying "" and "" ."
[15:58] fe069 | OK .
[15:59] fe066 | Right .
[16:01] me070 | Right .
[16:03] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:09] fe008 | Oh , yeah . This is an interesting category to me , and I don't ,"
"[16:12] fe008 | um , y y don't have to mark this systematically . But"
"[16:25] fe008 | So , if you 're doing you 're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel ,"
[16:30] fe008 | I don't think I 've made that explicit but it w it 's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context .
"[16:37] fe008 | And at that point what I sometimes pick up is this meta - level ,"
"[16:39] fe008 | where someone is finishes someone 's someone else 's utterance . So you 'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's because"
[16:42] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:47] fe008 | this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought , and they paused , and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word ."
[16:54] fe069 | Mmm .
[16:55] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[16:55] fe066 | Right .
"[17:01] fe008 | put capital letters . Capital letter , capital letter , colon ,"
"[17:03] fe008 | apostrophe "" S "" , utterance ."
[17:06] fe069 | Oh !
[17:06] fe008 | Yeah .
[17:07] me070 | Wait .
"[17:08] fe008 | So , if so in the examp i in the instance in which Let 's say that , um ,"
"[17:14] fe008 | Morgan 's talking ,"
"[17:15] fe008 | uh , so ,"
[17:17] fe008 | he 's talking .
"[17:18] fe008 | And then somewhere there 's a bit of a pause , and let 's say Adam"
[17:22] fe008 | fills in a word for him .
"[17:25] fe008 | Then what I do is , on Adam 's channel ,"
"[17:30] fe008 | I say , "" Completing """
"[17:36] fe068 | Oh , I see ."
"[17:36] fe008 | And this this isn't that common of an occurrence . "" Completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe "" S "" 's utterance "" ."
[17:38] fe069 | Oh !
[17:42] me070 | Oh .
[17:43] fe068 | OK .
"[17:43] fe008 | And what that means is at the time when we See we 're gonna go to a stage of anonymization . So it 's important to have the colon here because that 'll make it possible to easily know ,"
[17:48] me070 | Oh .
"[17:53] fe008 | you know , who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was . The problem with I originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent"
"[18:01] fe008 | index , but that that 's not functional because we have these two different numbering schemes . You have the numbering in the"
"[18:07] fe008 | Channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the "" key "" file and those can be very different . So , you know , to be able to ,"
[18:09] fe069 | Yeah .
[18:10] me070 | Right . Right .
[18:11] fe069 | Yeah .
"[18:12] fe008 | uh Th - this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you 're not gonna make a mistake . I tried to do it with the numbers and I was making all sorts of inconsistent problems , so I stopped it ."
"[18:19] fe066 | So that 's probably why you , like , added in"
[18:20] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:22] fe066 | that , um , thing that automatically puts in the"
[18:25] fe066 | people 's initials .
[18:26] fe069 | Initials ?
[18:27] fe008 | That 's that 's I did that partly to keep track of things . Absolutely .
[18:31] fe008 | Absolutely . Somet -
[18:31] fe069 | I I also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials . Yeah .
[18:32] fe066 | Uh - huh .
[18:34] fe066 | Oh yeah .
[18:35] fe066 | Initials .
"[18:36] fe008 | The initials ? I 'm glad to hear that . I st I didn't do that systematically until , uh , really rather recently , so . I"
[18:41] fe069 | Yeah . I find it much easier .
"[18:42] fe008 | I 'm glad to know that 's useful . It s takes an extra step . Glad it 's useful . OK , now I just have one more thing to say and that is that , um , um ,"
[18:42] fe069 | OK .
[18:42] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:49] fe008 | like once this is just such a rea I 'm getting down to like the really eensy - weensy stuff . But , um ,"
"[18:54] fe008 | once I found a comment that , uh , in in curly brackets about mumbling . And , um ,"
[19:01] fe008 | i g
"[19:01] fe008 | that 's that 's this is just to mention an instance that happened once , it 's really grasping for details . But , um ,"
[19:05] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:09] fe008 | f I think , and it may be that it was not from anybody here , so . But I think that , um , "" mumble "" is only useful in the s to me , in the sense of "" whispered "" ,"
"[19:19] fe008 | if it 's like a manner of speaking , in which case it 's a "" QUAL "" ."
"[19:22] fe008 | But not in terms of replacing , like , this string of undecipherable fragments . So ,"
"[19:27] me070 | Oh , right ."
[19:27] fe066 | Right . Oh yeah .
"[19:28] fe008 | um , this this was u when it was used exactly . It was used in place of , uh , something that was in unintelligible ."
[19:30] fe069 | OK .
[19:31] fe066 | To fill in . I see .
[19:31] me070 | Mmm .
[19:34] me070 | Right .
"[19:35] fe008 | In which case , it would be better to use parentheses and and"
"[19:37] me070 | The number "" X "" ."
"[19:38] fe008 | either exclamation , or the number of syllables , if you know ."
"[19:38] fe068 | And then do "" QUAL mumbled "" or "" QUAL whispered "" or something ."
"[19:42] fe008 | Exactly . If it 's a manner of speaking , then it 's useful . And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better ."
[19:43] fe068 | I see .
[19:45] me070 | Right .
[19:49] fe069 | OK .
[19:51] fe068 | OK .
"[19:51] fe008 | OK . So , I guess , you know , I don't wanna keep you . I kept you so long . I really appreciate this . Yes ?"
"[20:01] fe069 | "" QUAL "" is used for things like"
"[20:05] fe069 | "" whispered "" , or "" said while laughing "" , or things of that nature . Um , I remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non - vocal sounds ?"
[20:08] fe008 | Yes . Mm - hmm .
"[20:13] fe008 | Yes . Oh , but Good question . And you don't have to add any of those tags ."
[20:17] fe069 | Oh !
"[20:25] fe008 | this is again really rare , sometimes I 've run across the word "" noise "" ."
"[20:29] fe008 | And offhand , I don't know if that 's a vocal noise or non - vocal noise ."
[20:32] fe066 | Mmm .
[20:32] fe008 | And so then I listen to it and I figure it out .
"[20:42] fe008 | and of course I do my checks , and then I have a , um a script that I wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets , do a listing of them ,"
[20:50] me070 | Mmm .
"[20:51] fe008 | Some of them already have tags from some previous , uh , modification , but anything that doesn't , I just go through this list ,"
[21:01] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:04] fe008 | in one change , I can modify , you know , five hundred"
[21:07] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:08] fe008 | instances of this . So there 's no need to add the "" vocal "" or the "" non - vocal "" ."
[21:10] fe069 | Very efficient .
"[21:12] fe069 | OK . But for , like , noise that we"
[21:12] fe068 | Hmm !
[21:12] fe066 | Right .
[21:15] fe069 | know is
"[21:17] fe069 | something like mike noise , or something like a door , whatever , then we can mark it as that and no"
[21:19] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[21:19] fe008 | Yes .
"[21:21] fe008 | You can either if you mark it "" mike noise "" then I 'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put VOC or NVC on the in the substitution file ."
[21:27] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[21:27] fe069 | Right .
"[21:29] fe008 | But it 's it 's uh , very efficient for me to add those tags later ."
[21:31] fe069 | OK .
"[21:36] fe008 | or "" pron "" , but , you know , those that 's really very obvious , the pronunciation ."
[21:40] me070 | Yeah .
"[21:41] fe008 | So long as I can tell what they are . I think it 's good for you to add the "" pron "" . I would appreciate the "" pron "" , come to think of it ."
[21:41] fe069 | So we do need to add that one ?
[21:43] fe069 | OK . Sure . OK .
[21:44] fe068 | Good .
"[21:45] fe008 | But the other three i just so long as it 's clear to me , w"
"[21:49] fe008 | you know , from the comment which of those three it is , then I 'm fine ."
[21:52] fe068 | Good .
[21:53] fe008 | That 's great .
"[21:54] fe008 | Alright , so , um , I guess , um ,"
[21:56] fe068 | Do you wanna read digits ? Do you wanna do that ?
"[21:57] fe008 | Oh , thank you , do we have time ? Would you mind ? Can we do digits ? OK , so why don't do you wanna do it , uh , in unison this time ?"
"[21:59] fe069 | Yeah , that 's fine ."
[21:59] me070 | Yeah . That 's fine .
[21:59] fe068 | No ?
[22:00] fe066 | Yeah .
[22:03] fe069 | That 's what we did last time .
"[22:03] fe068 | Well , we did it in unison last time ."
"[22:05] fe008 | Oh we did ! Oh ! Do it separately , then . OK . Good deal ."
[22:05] fe069 | Yeah .
[22:06] me070 | Right .
[22:06] fe068 | Sure did .
[22:07] me070 | Yes .
"[22:10] fe068 | Oh , and do you want us to mark the t roughly the time we start ?"
"[22:12] fe008 | That is really what that time field is . I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting , but yes . Quite right . Quite right . That 'd be good ."
"[22:14] me070 | Oh , OK ."
"[22:16] fe068 | Oh , OK ."
[22:18] fe066 | The time we start digits ? OK .
[22:19] fe008 | Yeah .
"[22:21] fe008 | OK . So , who wants to start ?"
"[22:24] fe008 | Well , I guess I 'll start . OK . Transc - And the time is OK . Um ,"
"[23:06] fe008 | OK , I wanted to make one comment and that is , some of these are like two digits and just be sure you say both digits separately . So , one eight instead of eighteen . OK ."
[23:12] fe068 | Sure .
[23:12] me070 | Oh . Right .
[23:14] fe066 | I can go .
[23:14] fe008 | OK .
[26:41] fe068 | No problem .
[26:41] me070 | Sure .

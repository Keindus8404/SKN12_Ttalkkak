[00:38] me012 | Nice .
[00:40] fe004 | Is that good ?
[00:41] me012 | Right .
"[00:42] me012 | Yeah , I 've have never handled them ."
"[00:43] me003 | Goats eat cans ,"
[00:45] me003 | to my understanding .
[00:46] fe004 | Did we need to do these things ?
[00:46] me003 | Tin cans .
[00:47] fe016 | You don't need to read the digits if we think that that 's torture but the reason these are out there is do put your name on it because it 's the only record I have of actually who was sitting there .
[00:47] me012 | Wow .
"[00:57] fe016 | Um , your name and some but it ."
[01:05] fe016 | OK . You should be in play .
[01:10] fe016 | And we can you can flip this and uh get rid of the screen but @ @
[01:17] fe016 | The uh the the remote @ @
[01:17] me003 | Robert ?
[01:19] mn015 | @ @
"[01:19] me003 | Oh , the remote will do it OK . Cuz I 'm already up there ?"
[01:21] mn015 | @ @
[01:22] mn015 | I 'm in control here .
[01:24] fe016 | OK . Have a great meeting . I 'll I 'll come back up in about an hour and check and see if you 're still meeting .
[01:24] me003 | You are in control .
"[01:35] fe004 | Wow , we 're all so high tech here . Yet another p PowerPoint presentation ."
[01:40] me003 | I Well it makes it easier to do PowerPoint.
[01:42] fe004 | Certainly does .
[01:51] me003 | OK .
"[01:52] me003 | So ,"
[01:54] me003 | Let 's see . Which one of these buttons will do this for me ?
[01:59] me003 | Aha ! OK .
[02:01] me012 | Should you go back to the first one ?
[02:03] me003 | Do I wanna go back to the first one ? OK .
[02:07] me003 | OK . Introduce .
[02:08] fe004 | OK .
[02:13] fe004 | I can read ! I 'm kidding .
[02:21] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[02:22] mn015 | But if you really want to find out what it 's about you have to click on the little light bulb .
[02:27] me003 | Although I 've I 've never I don't know what the light bulb is for . I didn't i install that into my PowerPoint presentation .
[02:31] mn015 | It opens the Assistant that tells you that the font type is too small .
[02:35] me003 | Ah .
[02:36] mn015 | Do you wanna try ?
[02:36] fe004 | Ach u
[02:38] me003 | I 'd prefer not to .
[02:39] mn015 | OK .
[02:40] mn015 | Continue .
[02:41] fe004 | It 's a needless good idea . Is that the idea ? OK .
[02:43] mn015 | Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ?
[02:46] me003 | Because I 'm gonna switch to the JavaBayes
[02:47] mn015 | Oh ! OK . Of course . Mm - hmm .
[02:48] me003 | program and then if I do that
[02:51] me003 | it 'll mess everything up .
[02:54] me003 | Is that OK ?
"[02:55] fe004 | Yeah , it 's OK ."
[02:55] mn015 | Sure .
[02:56] me012 | Can you maximize the window ?
[02:57] fe004 | Proceed .
"[02:58] me003 | You want me to Wait , what do you want me to do ?"
[03:00] me012 | Can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn't doesn't appear ?
"[03:03] mn015 | No , It 's OK . It 's It 'll work ."
"[03:04] me003 | Well I can do that , but then I have to end the presentation in the middle so I can go back to open up JavaBayes."
"[03:08] me012 | OK , fine ."
[03:13] me012 | Alright .
[03:13] fe004 | Very nice .
[03:14] me003 | Is that better ?
[03:15] me012 | Yeah .
[03:15] me003 | OK .
"[03:16] me003 | Uh I 'll also get rid of this "" Click to add notes "" ."
[03:19] me003 | OK .
[03:20] fe004 | Perfect .
"[03:21] me003 | So then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about , right ?"
"[03:24] me003 | Uh the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . You know . We had a list of things like"
"[03:29] me003 | "" to go "" and "" to visit "" and what not ."
[03:35] me003 | I knew you 'd like that .
"[03:39] me003 | Thank you . uh ,"
[03:41] me003 | of a of a building .
[03:42] me003 | Whether the
[03:43] me003 | and this i we actually have a separate feature but I decided to put it on the same line for space .
"[03:47] me003 | "" Nice walls """
"[03:49] me003 | which we can look up because I mean if you 're gonna get real close to a building in the Tango mode , right , there 's gotta be a reason for it ."
[03:54] me003 | And it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls .
"[03:59] me003 | The context , which in this case we 've limited to "" business person "" , "" tourist "" , or "" unknown "" ,"
"[04:05] me003 | the time of day ,"
"[04:07] me003 | and "" open to suggestions "" , isn't actually a feature ."
"[04:09] me003 | It 's "" We are open to suggestions . """
[04:19] fe004 | but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with
[04:23] me012 | No . We have a separate
[04:25] me003 | They 're separate things .
[04:26] fe004 | their being nice w OK .
[04:26] me012 | feature .
"[04:27] me003 | Yeah . I either could put "" nice walls "" on its own line or "" open to suggestions "" off the slide ."
[04:30] me012 | Like you could have a p
"[04:31] me012 | You Like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something ."
[04:35] me003 | Right .
"[04:35] fe004 | OK . So "" nice walls "" is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh significant or something like that ."
[04:48] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[04:49] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[04:50] mn015 | Appreciate it .
"[04:51] me003 | Yeah , versus ,"
"[04:52] me003 | like , I was at this place in Europe where they had little carvings"
[04:55] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:55] me003 | of , like , dead people on the walls or something ."
[04:57] me003 | I don't remember w
[04:57] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[05:05] me003 | of the walls .
[05:05] fe004 | OK . So that count as counts as a nice wall .
[05:07] me003 | Right .
[05:08] fe004 | The OK .
[05:08] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[05:09] fe004 | Right .
[05:10] fe004 | Something you want to inspect at close range because it 's interesting . OK .
[05:11] me003 | Exactly .
[05:14] mn015 | Hmm .
[05:14] me003 | Robert ?
"[05:15] mn015 | Well there there is a term that 's often used . That 's "" saliency "" , or the "" salience "" of an object ."
"[05:22] mn015 | And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as "" landmark - iness "" ."
[05:28] mn015 | But it 's really not . I mean an object can be very salient but
[05:29] fe004 | Hmm .
[05:31] fe004 | Not a landmark at all .
[05:32] mn015 | not a landmark at all .
[05:38] me003 | Right .
[05:38] mn015 | Yep .
"[05:38] me012 | Yeah , we meant , uh , touristic reasons ."
[05:40] me003 | Yeah .
[05:40] fe004 | OK .
[05:41] mn015 | Hmm .
[05:41] me003 | Right .
[05:41] fe004 | OK .
"[05:42] fe004 | but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals ."
[05:45] mn015 | Hmm .
[05:46] me012 | Yeah .
[05:47] fe004 | Right ?
[05:47] me003 | Right .
[05:49] me003 | Yeah .
"[05:53] me003 | They 're not exclusive groups , are they ?"
[05:56] mn015 | Or it can be als
[05:56] me003 | non - tourist - y landmarks and
[05:58] fe004 | They 're not mutually exclusive ?
[05:58] me003 | direct navigational Yeah .
[06:00] fe004 | Right . Right . Definitely .
[06:00] me003 | OK .
[06:08] me003 | uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node .
[06:13] me003 | Uh .
"[06:14] fe004 | So , a big flat structure . Right ?"
[06:16] me003 | Right .
[06:16] me012 | Yep .
"[06:20] me003 | Reasons being ,"
"[06:21] me003 | you know ,"
[06:22] me003 | it 'd be a pain to set up all the probabilities
[06:24] me003 | for that .
[06:26] me003 | If we moved onto the next step and
"[06:28] me003 | did learning of some sort ,"
[06:30] me003 | uh according Bhaskara we 'd be handicapped .
[06:33] me003 | I don't know
[06:34] me003 | belief - nets very well .
"[06:35] me012 | If you have N features , then it 's two to the N or exponential in N ."
[06:40] me003 | And they wouldn't look pretty .
[06:41] me003 | So .
"[06:42] me012 | Yeah , they 'd all be like pointing to the one node ."
[06:43] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[06:46] me003 | Uh .
"[06:47] me003 | So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ?"
[06:50] me003 | So the thinking behind that was
"[06:56] me003 | Like , the someone s"
"[06:58] me003 | The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like"
"[07:00] me003 | "" I 'm """
"[07:01] me003 | the the abstract idea being "" I am a tourist I want to go to this place . """
[07:05] me003 | Right ?
[07:11] me003 | the means
[07:13] me003 | that they should use . Right ?
[07:14] me003 | but the middle
"[07:15] me003 | thing ,"
[07:15] me003 | we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to
"[07:18] me003 | figure out ,"
[07:21] me003 | or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines .
"[07:28] me003 | Yes , we could"
[07:34] me003 | So then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with
[07:38] me003 | were whether
"[07:40] me003 | someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry ,"
[07:43] me003 | because
"[07:44] me003 | we were thinking uh ,"
"[07:49] me012 | Want to do Vista , right ? Because if you want to view things you wouldn't be in a hurry ."
[07:49] me003 | or th
[07:50] me003 | Right .
[07:57] me003 | like a navigational point to go to another place .
[08:00] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[08:07] me003 | And then
"[08:08] me003 | "" Let 's look at the belief - net "" OK . So that means that I should switch to the other program ."
"[08:13] me003 | Um right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it , because"
[08:22] me003 | Well I 'll talk about it when I get the picture up .
[08:24] mn015 | No one knows it .
[08:25] me003 | OK .
[08:28] me003 | Let 's see . What happens if I maximize this ?
[08:33] me003 | There we go .
[08:37] me003 | So .
[08:39] me003 | The mode basically has three different outputs .
"[08:42] me003 | The probability whether the probability of a Vista , Tango , or Enter ."
"[08:50] me003 | The "" context "" , we simplified . Basically it 's just the businessman ,"
"[08:54] me003 | the tourist , unknown ."
"[08:55] me003 | "" Verb used "" is actually"
[08:58] me003 | personally amusing
[08:59] me003 | mainly because it 's it 's just
"[09:01] me003 | whether the verb is a Tango verb , an Enter verb , or a Vista verb ."
[09:05] fe004 | And are those mutually exclusive sets ? Right . Got it . Uh - huh .
"[09:07] me012 | Not at all . That 's that that needs a lot of work . But uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs ."
[09:13] fe004 | Yeah .
[09:15] fe004 | Simple .
[09:16] me003 | Yeah .
[09:16] fe004 | Stab at it . Yep .
[09:17] me003 | Right .
[09:24] me003 | not that are not coming to my mind right now .
"[09:27] me012 | OK , so Yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the sort of , the things that are not directly extracted ."
[09:40] me003 | Well i it 's it 's so
[09:40] fe004 | From the utterance ?
[09:40] me012 | Hmm .
"[09:46] me012 | Right , so f"
[09:46] me003 | er and what time it closed .
"[09:48] me012 | Right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . Yeah ."
[09:58] fe004 | Inferred from the other ones ?
[09:59] fe004 | OK .
"[10:01] me012 | And the mode , you know , depends on all those things only ."
[10:05] me003 | the actual parse is somewhere
[10:08] me003 | up around in here .
[10:11] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:15] me012 | The idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have a node for the entire parse , because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so ."
[10:18] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[10:19] me003 | Right .
"[10:23] fe004 | So some of the the top row of things What 's what 's "" Disc admission fee "" ?"
[10:30] fe004 | Oh .
[10:35] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[10:37] me003 | Right .
[10:38] fe004 | OK . I see .
[10:42] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[10:44] me012 | That was like our example .
[10:45] me003 | That was the initial one that we found .
[10:45] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[10:50] me003 | Yeah .
[10:52] fe004 | for one of those .
[11:01] fe004 | either world knowledge or situational things . Right ? So that you have no distinction between those and @ @ OK .
[11:04] me003 | Right .
[11:12] me003 | Uh .
"[11:14] me003 | Um , anything else you want to say Bhaskara ?"
[11:22] mn015 | Yeah . They 're they 're are a couple of more things . I mean
[11:25] mn015 | Uh .
[11:25] mn015 | I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all
"[11:29] mn015 | uh , agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes"
"[11:36] me003 | Yeah , th"
[11:36] me003 | OK . so one thing I I 'm
"[11:44] me003 | by doing the layers like this ,"
[11:52] me003 | but you could see perhaps discus
"[11:54] me003 | the "" admission fee """
[11:55] me003 | going directly to the mode
"[11:56] me003 | pointing at "" Enter "" ,"
[11:57] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:57] me003 | right ? Versus pointing to just at "" tourist "" ,"
[11:58] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[12:00] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[12:00] me003 | OK ?
[12:01] me003 | But
[12:02] me003 | we just decided to
[12:06] me003 | to point at the middle and then down .
[12:07] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[12:12] mn015 | OK . The landmark is facing to the tourists .
[12:16] mn015 | That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not
[12:18] me003 | Right .
[12:19] me012 | Yeah .
[12:19] mn015 | as possible
[12:21] mn015 | um
"[12:22] me003 | Navigational landmarks , yeah ."
[12:23] fe004 | Navigational
[12:23] mn015 | navigational landmarks so
[12:26] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:29] me003 | Yeah , that would be whatever building they referred to ."
"[12:32] me012 | Right . So let 's see . The variables . Disc - "" admission fee "" is a binary thing , "" time of day "" is like morning , afternoon , night . Is that the deal ?"
[12:33] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:39] me003 | That 's how we have it currently set up , but it could be , you know ,"
[12:40] mn015 | Yep .
[12:41] me003 | based upon hour or dis we could discrete it des descret - ize it .
[12:42] me012 | Yeah .
[12:42] mn015 | Whatever granularity . Uh - huh .
[12:43] me012 | Yeah .
[12:43] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[12:44] me012 | Yeah .
"[12:45] me012 | Yeah . Normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , I guess ."
[12:56] mn015 | Yep .
[12:56] fe004 | OK . So that 's given in their input . Right ?
[12:58] me003 | Right .
[13:04] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:07] mn015 | that 's very nice , huh ?"
[13:07] fe004 | OK .
[13:08] mn015 | The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ? Or also unknown ?
"[13:12] me003 | Or un unknown , yeah ."
"[13:13] me012 | Yeah . Unknown , right ?"
[13:13] mn015 | OK .
[13:13] fe004 | So final dest
"[13:15] fe004 | So it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist ,"
[13:21] me012 | Which is th Which one ?
"[13:21] fe004 | but OK . so the the context being um ,"
"[13:25] fe004 | e I don't know if that question 's sort of in general , "" are you """
"[13:33] me012 | Yeah , it does ."
[13:34] fe004 | OK . So then you just have some probabilities over OK . over which which of those it is .
[13:39] me012 | Yeah .
"[13:43] me012 | Oh , sorry . "" Verb used "" is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs ."
[13:48] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[13:56] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:05] me012 | And "" mode "" is one of three things ."
"[14:11] mn015 | So , the the middle layer is also binary ? No ."
[14:20] mn015 | Uh .
[14:22] mn015 | Yeah . But all those things without question marks are also binary . Right ?
[14:26] me012 | Which things ?
[14:27] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[14:27] mn015 | Nice walls ?
"[14:28] me012 | Oh . "" Nice walls "" is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge ."
[14:32] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:33] me012 | Yeah , a Oh yeah . Sorry . It is binary ."
[14:35] me012 | That 's true .
"[14:36] me012 | Yeah . OK , I see your point ."
[14:38] mn015 | Yeah . OK . I I gotcha .
[14:38] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[14:42] mn015 | So we can either be in a hurry or not , but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ?"
"[14:47] me012 | Well , we"
[14:50] mn015 | Mm - hmm . OK .
"[14:50] me012 | And that would require s updating the probability distribution for "" mode "" as well ."
[14:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[14:54] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[14:56] fe004 | Take a conti
[15:00] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:02] fe004 | So um , of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things"
"[15:06] mn015 | Yeah , yeah ."
[15:07] me012 | Yeah .
"[15:14] fe004 | Like it 's a conjunction of , I don't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine Yeah . Exactly ."
[15:18] me012 | Right . Other syntactic information you mean ? Yeah .
[15:22] mn015 | well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ?
[15:27] fe004 | Usually . I I don't know if that 's always the case I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have . So . Um .
[15:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[15:36] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[15:38] mn015 | Uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers
[15:44] me003 | Hmm .
[15:44] mn015 | in there because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not
[15:48] me012 | Yeah .
[15:48] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:51] me012 | Yeah , right ."
[15:52] mn015 | what 's the fastest way
"[15:54] me012 | Yeah , correct ."
[15:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[15:57] fe004 | Um .
[15:58] me003 | Right . Excellent .
[16:02] me003 | Do we have anything else to say about this ?
[16:08] me003 | But the demo doesn't work very well .
[16:10] fe004 | OK .
"[16:10] mn015 | No , then it wouldn't be a demo"
[16:13] mn015 | I was just gonna s
"[16:15] me012 | just ob observe the fact that this will , in fact do inference . So we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then"
[16:20] fe004 | Yeah . Go ahead .
[16:21] me003 | OK .
[16:21] me012 | try to find the probability of other nodes .
[16:25] me003 | What should I observe ?
[16:29] me003 | OK .
[16:32] me003 | OK .
[16:38] me003 | OK .
[16:40] me012 | and uh the place has nice walls
"[16:46] me003 | I love nice walls , OK ?"
[16:48] me003 | I 'm a big fan .
[16:49] me012 | and it 's night .
[16:51] me003 | And the time of day is night ?
[16:59] me003 | Alright .
[17:01] me012 | And it 's night .
[17:05] me003 | OK .
[17:07] me012 | That didn't work .
[17:10] me003 | One thing that bugs me about JavaBayes is you have to click that and do this .
[17:12] fe004 | Yeah . That seems kind of redundant but .
[17:17] me003 | That all you want ?
[17:18] me012 | Yes .
"[17:20] me012 | "" Go "" and , right , "" query "" ."
"[17:21] me003 | to query , right ?"
[17:22] me003 | the mode .
[17:28] me003 | So let 's see .
[17:31] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[17:33] me003 | Yeah .
"[17:35] fe004 | So slightly biased toward "" Tango "" ing"
[17:38] me012 | Yeah .
"[17:39] me003 | If it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . So , yeah ."
[17:42] me003 | I guess that sort of makes sense .
"[17:51] me003 | taking a tour , and it came up as "" Tango "" ,"
[17:55] fe004 | So .
[17:56] fe004 | Uh - huh .
[17:59] fe004 | Huh !
[17:59] me012 | It loves the Tango .
[18:03] fe004 | Um .
[18:07] fe004 | Yeah .
[18:09] fe004 | OK .
"[18:10] me012 | "" hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , fifty per "" Like , you know ."
[18:16] fe004 | Right .
[18:16] me003 | Yeah .
"[18:17] fe004 | Maybe the bias toward "" Tango "" ing was yours , then ?"
[18:20] me012 | Yeah . It 's So we have to like fit the probabilities .
[18:24] me003 | Spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte .
"[18:24] fe004 | So , the real case ?"
[18:34] mn015 | but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer .
[18:37] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[18:37] mn015 | And so th
"[18:40] me003 | I guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes ,"
[18:43] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[18:44] me012 | Yeah .
[18:44] me003 | but
[18:46] me003 | I 'd like to see more .
"[18:48] me003 | Not because it would expedite the probabilities ,"
[18:50] me003 | cuz it wouldn't .
[18:51] me003 | It would actually slow that down tremendously .
"[18:53] me012 | Um . Well , yeah , I guess . Not that much though . Only a little early ."
[18:56] me003 | But .
[19:01] me003 | middle nodes than features we 've extracted .
[19:05] me012 | OK .
[19:17] fe004 | And are th
"[19:18] me012 | I think it 's more like "" Are you are tourist ? are you in Ham - like Heidelberg for a """
"[19:23] fe004 | Oh , so , I thought that was directly given by the context switch ."
"[19:25] me012 | That 's a different thing . What if the context , which is not set ,"
[19:31] me003 | Well the
"[19:31] me012 | the the castle and uh ,"
"[19:33] me003 | I kind of thought of "" doing business "" as more of running an errand type thing ."
"[19:33] me012 | et cetera . """
"[19:39] mn015 | So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT -"
[19:40] me003 | So i wi th
[19:40] fe004 | OK .
"[19:42] fe004 | Oh , I see , you may have a task . wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage ."
[19:46] mn015 | Mmm .
[19:46] me012 | Yeah .
[19:46] me003 | Right .
"[19:48] mn015 | "" How do I get to the bank ? """
[19:51] fe004 | Hmm .
[19:52] me012 | And that 'll affect whether you want to enter or you if you kinda thing .
[19:56] fe004 | OK .
[20:06] fe004 | in general what their background is .
[20:17] fe004 | I mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node .
"[20:18] me012 | If the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh"
[20:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:23] me012 | um , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists . So what 's interesting is when it 's not when it 's set to "" unknown "" ."
[20:25] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[20:26] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:28] mn015 | We - what set the they set the context to "" unknown "" ?"
[20:28] fe004 | OK .
[20:31] me003 | OK .
"[20:32] me012 | Right now we haven't observed it , so I guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities ."
[20:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[20:36] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[20:36] me003 | Right .
"[20:37] me012 | But yes , you can set it to un "" unknown "" ."
[20:41] mn015 | leave everything else
[20:43] mn015 | as is
"[20:45] mn015 | the results should be the same , right ?"
[20:48] me003 | No .
[20:59] mn015 | Pretty much the same ?
[21:03] me012 | So the issue is that um
"[21:04] me012 | in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then "" unknown "" as an actual value ."
[21:11] fe004 | Yeah .
[21:13] fe004 | Yeah .
[21:13] mn015 | Yep .
"[21:20] me003 | We were thi Yeah ,"
[21:21] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[21:21] me003 | We were th
[21:25] me012 | I don't know if I totally am happy with the way it is .
"[21:32] mn015 | How long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and , um , play around with it ?"
[21:41] me012 | Another node on what ?
[22:01] mn015 | but they can never be entered ? So for example s a statue .
[22:07] me012 | Good point .
[22:08] mn015 | Yeah ?
[22:08] me003 | Right .
[22:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:13] mn015 | meaning now "" enterable landmark """
"[22:16] me003 | Yeah , that 's true ."
"[22:17] mn015 | versus , um"
"[22:20] mn015 | something that 's simply just a vista point , for example ."
[22:23] mn015 | Yeah ?
"[22:27] me012 | So basically it 's addressing a variable that 's "" enterable or not "" . So like an "" enterable , question mark "" ."
"[22:33] me003 | you know , didn't we have a size as one ?"
[22:37] me012 | What ?
[22:37] me003 | The size of the landmark .
"[22:39] me012 | Um . Not when we were doing this , but I guess at some point we did ."
[22:41] me003 | Yeah .
"[22:43] me003 | OK , that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away ."
[22:47] me012 | So you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ?
"[22:50] mn015 | Well ,"
"[22:51] mn015 | for example , if we include that , yeah ?"
[22:53] me012 | Yeah .
"[22:54] mn015 | um , accessibility or something , yeah ?"
[22:57] me012 | Hmm .
"[22:57] mn015 | "" Is it Can it be entered ? """
"[22:59] mn015 | then of course , this is sort of binary as well ."
[23:02] me012 | Yeah .
"[23:04] mn015 | And then um , there 's also the question whether it may be entered ."
"[23:11] mn015 | In the sense that ,"
"[23:12] mn015 | you know , if it 's Tom the house of Tom Cruise ,"
"[23:15] mn015 | you know , it 's enterable"
[23:17] mn015 | but you may not enter it .
[23:19] mn015 | You know ? You 're not allowed to .
[23:20] me012 | Yeah .
[23:23] me012 | Yeah .
[23:30] me003 | Way -
[23:31] mn015 | And these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of things .
[23:35] me003 | Does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ?
[23:37] me003 | Whether it 's
"[23:40] me003 | practically speaking enterable , or"
[23:43] me003 | actually physically enterable or not ?
"[23:46] fe004 | It seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wanna go into it or not ."
[23:46] mn015 | y y
[23:51] mn015 | If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not
[23:57] mn015 | al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m
[24:00] mn015 | Let 's get this uh b clearer .
[24:03] mn015 | S so it 's matrix between
"[24:07] me003 | Whether it 's a Whether it 's a public building ,"
[24:10] me003 | and whether it 's actually has a door .
"[24:13] mn015 | Yeah , exactly ."
[24:14] me003 | OK .
[24:15] mn015 | This is sort of uh
[24:16] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[24:16] me003 | So Tom Cruise 's house is not a public building but it has a door .
[24:19] fe004 | Right .
[24:19] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:21] me003 | OK ,"
[24:24] me003 | to distinguish between
[24:27] me003 | whether something
[24:29] me003 | has a door
[24:31] me003 | and is not public .
[24:35] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:38] me003 | Or "" not public "" and "" not a door "" are equivalent things , it seems like in practice ."
[24:41] mn015 | Yeah .
[24:43] mn015 | Right .
[25:00] mn015 | Yeah .
[25:03] mn015 | we have an object type statue . That really is an object type .
[25:08] me003 | Right .
[25:08] mn015 | So there is there 's gonna be a bunch of statues .
"[25:11] mn015 | And then we have ,"
"[25:15] mn015 | hmm , that 's a hotel . How about hotels ?"
[25:19] me003 | OK .
"[25:20] mn015 | So ,"
[25:21] mn015 | the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel .
"[25:24] mn015 | It 's the hotel Zum Ritter ,"
[25:26] mn015 | which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg
"[25:29] mn015 | that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah ."
[25:34] me003 | Does it have nice walls ?
[25:38] me003 | Excellent .
[25:38] mn015 | Um -
"[25:39] mn015 | And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth , so ."
"[25:44] mn015 | But , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say ."
[25:51] mn015 | But .
[25:51] mn015 | Um . So s
[25:53] mn015 | So if
[25:55] mn015 | you are a d
[25:57] mn015 | Well it 's very tricky .
[25:58] mn015 | So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg
"[26:04] mn015 | statues and houses of celebrities ,"
[26:08] mn015 | from that point of view .
[26:12] mn015 | Huh .
[26:21] me003 | OK .
"[26:21] me012 | What would it , uh , connect to ? Like , what would , uh , it affect ?"
"[26:27] mn015 | Oh actually it 's it it wouldn't affect any of our nodes , right ?"
[26:32] mn015 | Oh it 's it affects th
"[26:34] mn015 | The "" doing business "" is certainly not ."
"[26:36] me003 | Theoretically you could affect "" doing business "" with "" has door "" ."
[26:40] me012 | Yeah . OK .
[26:40] fe004 | Hmm .
"[26:41] mn015 | It should , um ,"
[26:42] me012 | Right .
[26:43] me003 | Let 's see .
"[26:43] mn015 | inhibit that , right ?"
[26:51] me012 | it just overwrites everything .
[26:56] me012 | OK .
[26:56] me003 | We can rel open it up again .
[26:58] me012 | It 's true .
[26:59] me003 | The safety net .
"[27:09] fe004 | Oh , right ."
[27:11] me003 | Let 's see . So this is
"[27:14] me003 | "" has door """
"[27:16] me003 | Uh , true , false . That 's acceptable ."
"[27:19] me003 | And I want to edit the function going to that , right ?"
"[27:22] me012 | No . This is fine , this business ."
[27:22] me003 | Oh no .
[27:23] me003 | Right . It was fine .
[27:26] me003 | 2 x added this one .
[27:28] me012 | What would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value but .
[27:34] me012 | Nope .
[27:35] me012 | Didn't do it .
[27:35] fe004 | Oh .
[27:37] me003 | Did we w
"[27:39] me003 | Yes , that 's not good ."
[27:42] me012 | That 's kind of annoying .
"[27:48] mn015 | OK , so just dis dismiss everything ."
[27:50] mn015 | Close it and and load up the old state so
[27:52] me003 | Let 's see .
[27:58] me012 | Hmm .
[27:58] mn015 | Maybe you can read in ?
[27:59] me012 | Ha -
[27:59] me012 | So have you used JavaBayes a lot ?
"[28:06] fe004 | um , uh , we can ask someone ."
"[28:08] me012 | It might be worth uh asking around . Like ,"
[28:08] fe004 | Um .
[28:10] fe004 | Yeah .
"[28:13] me012 | OK . Yeah , S I guess he 'd be the person ."
[28:15] me012 | Yeah .
[28:16] me012 | Cuz Yeah .
[28:16] fe004 | And .
[28:21] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[28:25] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[28:26] me003 | No it doesn't , actually ."
[28:27] me012 | What ?
[28:27] me003 | I didn't think it did learning .
[28:29] me012 | OK .
"[28:29] me003 | Maybe it did a little bit of learning , I don't remember ."
[28:30] me012 | Oh right . Maybe you 're right . OK .
[28:32] me012 | Right .
"[28:36] me003 | Which is w quite positive , yeah ."
"[28:39] me012 | But uh , yeah ."
[28:43] me012 | But I mean its interface is not the greatest . So .
[28:45] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:45] me003 | But actually it had an interface . A lot of them were like , you know ."
[28:48] fe004 | Yep .
[28:49] mn015 | Command line .
[28:49] me003 | Huh .
[28:54] mn015 | How do you write the code or do you actually never have to write any code there ?
[28:54] me003 | The c
[28:57] me012 | Yeah . There is actually a text file that you can edit .
[29:00] me012 | But it 's You don't have to do that .
[29:02] me003 | There 's like an XML format for Bayes - nets .
[29:05] me012 | Is it XML ?
[29:06] me003 | The - there is one . I don't know if this uses it .
"[29:07] me012 | Oh , I see . No this doesn't use it ."
[29:09] me012 | I didn't think it did .
[29:12] me012 | You can look at the text file .
[29:13] me003 | Yeah .
[29:13] me012 | But do you have it here ?
"[29:14] me012 | Well , maybe you don't ."
"[29:14] me003 | Uh , yes I do actually . Let me see ."
[29:19] me003 | Is there an ampersand in DOS ?
[29:21] me012 | Nope . Just s l start up a new DOS .
[29:23] me003 | We - That 's alright . I can probably double cli click on it .
"[29:26] me012 | Or Yeah , right ."
[29:30] me003 | Let 's see .
[29:34] me012 | Yep .
"[29:37] me003 | Let 's see , come on ."
[29:40] me012 | what you want to open it with and see
"[29:42] me012 | what BAT , I guess ."
"[29:43] me003 | One of these days , it should open this , theoretically ."
[29:45] mn015 | Go Right mouse .
[29:48] mn015 | Open with .
[29:52] me012 | That 's Oh !
[29:52] me003 | Oh there we go .
[29:54] me003 | Oh ! W
[29:54] mn015 | Oh .
"[29:55] me003 | Ah , it was dead ."
[30:02] me003 | OK .
[30:03] mn015 | Through the old Notepad . That 's my favorite editor .
[30:06] mn015 | Wordpad ?
"[30:09] me003 | the returns , the carriage returns on some of them ."
"[30:12] me003 | You know how they get "" auto - fills "" I guess , or whatever you call it ."
[30:14] mn015 | Mmm - hmm .
"[30:15] me012 | Anyway , there it is ."
[30:18] mn015 | So this is sort of LISP - y ?
[30:21] mn015 | No .
"[30:21] me012 | Uh , Yeah ."
[30:23] me003 | It just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of STRUCTs.
[30:25] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[30:30] me003 | Yeah .
[30:30] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:32] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[30:34] me012 | But they 're not very friendly .
[30:37] fe004 | Right .
[30:39] fe004 | The layout of the table . Yeah .
[30:39] me012 | Like you have to go and Yeah .
[30:41] me003 | Actually we could write a program that could generate this .
[30:43] me012 | Yeah .
[30:44] me012 | I think so .
[30:45] fe004 | You could .
"[30:47] me012 | Yeah we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distributions easily ,"
[30:53] me012 | That might be worth it .
[30:56] mn015 | And that might do .
[30:56] fe004 | Yeah . I actually seem to recall Srini complaining about something to do with Entering probability so this is probably
[31:01] me012 | The other thing is it is in Java so .
"[31:01] fe004 | Yeah , it 's Yeah ."
[31:05] fe004 | Yeah .
[31:07] mn015 | Do you have the true source files or just the class ?
"[31:09] me012 | Yeah . Uh , yeah . we do"
[31:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[31:13] me003 | I didn't e
[31:14] me012 | Yeah . Go up one ?
[31:15] me003 | Up one .
[31:17] me012 | Yeah .
[31:20] me003 | That 's that 's quite nice .
[31:25] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:28] me012 | It 's , like , friendly , it allows you enter things well ."
[31:28] fe004 | The d
[31:29] fe004 | the data tables .
[31:31] fe004 | Yeah .
[31:34] me003 | Right .
"[31:40] mn015 | I mean it just reads this , right ? When it starts ."
[31:41] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[31:42] me003 | Yeah I know there is an I was looking on the we web page and he 's updated it for an XML version of I guess Bayes - nets . There 's a Bayes - net spec for in XML .
[31:48] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:49] me012 | He 's Like this guy has ? The JavaBayes guy ? So but , e he doesn't use it . So in what sense has he updated it ?"
[31:51] me003 | Yeah .
[31:55] me003 | Well th you can either you ca or you can read both .
[31:57] me012 | Oh . I see .
[31:57] me003 | To my understanding .
[31:58] me012 | OK . That would be awesome .
[31:58] fe004 | Oh .
"[32:02] me003 | I could have misread the web page , I have a habit of doing that , but ."
"[32:09] mn015 | OK , wonderful ."
[32:09] me012 | OK .
[32:11] mn015 | So you got more slides ?
[32:13] me003 | Do I have more slides ?
"[32:17] me003 | Um yes , one more . "" Future Work "" . I think every presentation have a should have a "" Future Work "" slide ."
"[32:24] me003 | But uh it 's basically we already talked about all this stuff , so ."
[32:34] me003 | Uh that 's future future work .
[32:35] me012 | That 's Yeah .
[32:37] me003 | Right .
[32:37] me012 | Very future .
[32:41] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:41] me003 | And of course if you have a presentation that doesn't have something that doesn't work at all , then you have "" What I learned "" ,"
[32:47] me003 | as a slide .
[32:50] fe004 | Can't you have both ?
[32:52] me003 | You could .
[32:55] me003 | My first approach failed .
"[32:58] me003 | What I learned . OK , so I think that uh our presentation 's finished ."
[33:03] mn015 | Good .
"[33:07] me003 | I know what I like about these meetings is one person will nod , and then the next person will nod , and then it just goes all the way around the room ."
[33:21] mn015 | It 's like yawning .
[33:21] fe004 | It 's like yawning .
[33:23] mn015 | And this announcement was in stereo .
[33:24] me012 | Ha .
[33:25] mn015 | OK .
[33:28] me003 | Should I pull up the net again ? Yes .
[33:32] me003 | There we go .
[33:36] me003 | And actually I was cuz I got a wireless mike on .
"[33:54] fe004 | um , there might be other cues that , say , um ,"
[33:57] fe004 | in the last few utterances
[34:06] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:07] fe004 | uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up ."
[34:18] mn015 | um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe
[34:21] mn015 | we ob we could observe a couple of
[34:24] mn015 | um
[34:26] mn015 | discourse phenomena
[34:28] mn015 | such as
"[34:29] mn015 | the admission fee , and"
"[34:32] mn015 | something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before ."
[34:36] fe004 | Right .
[34:38] mn015 | let 's make those four .
[34:45] mn015 | So maybe this could be sort of a separate
"[34:48] mn015 | region of the net ,"
"[34:54] mn015 | Maybe this , you know , has some kind of um ,"
[34:59] mn015 | funky thing that di if this and this may influence
[35:02] mn015 | these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something
"[35:06] mn015 | that is uh ,"
[35:09] mn015 | a more general version of the actual
[35:21] fe004 | Exactly . Yeah .
"[35:22] me003 | "" admission fee "" , or maybe , you know , "" how much to enter "" or you know something , other cues . Exactly ."
[35:26] fe004 | Opening hours or something like that .
[35:28] me003 | That would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that .
[35:33] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[35:36] mn015 | uh uh d
[35:36] me012 | Sure . Yeah .
[35:36] mn015 | Yeah ?
"[35:36] fe004 | I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . I mean that 's like the bigger um ,"
[35:41] mn015 | Exactly . Yeah ? And then maybe there are some
"[35:44] mn015 | discourse acts if they happened before ,"
[35:47] mn015 | um it 's more for um
[35:50] mn015 | a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route
"[35:55] mn015 | um , sort of proceeding"
"[35:58] mn015 | past these things , so this would be just something that where you"
[36:02] mn015 | want to
[36:04] mn015 | pass it . Hmm ?
[36:06] mn015 | Is that it ?
[36:10] mn015 | However these are of course then
"[36:14] mn015 | the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer ."
"[36:19] mn015 | So this again points to "" final destination "" , "" doing business "" , "" tourist hurry "" and so forth ."
[36:23] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[36:24] me003 | OK .
[36:26] mn015 | Yeah ?
"[36:26] mn015 | And so then we can say , "" OK . we have a whole region """
[36:31] mn015 | in a e
"[36:33] mn015 | Yeah , exactly . And this is just then just one ."
"[36:35] mn015 | So e because at the end the more we um add ,"
"[36:38] mn015 | you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . It 's going to get very ugly ."
"[36:44] mn015 | But with this way we could say "" OK , these are the discourse phenomena . They ra may have there own hidden layer"
[36:53] mn015 | um or the general hidden layer .
[36:55] mn015 | And the same we will be able to do for
"[36:58] mn015 | syntactic information , the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers ."
[37:03] mn015 | And maybe there 's a hidden layer
[37:04] me012 | Yep .
[37:05] mn015 | for that . And so forth and so forth . Then we have context .
[37:07] me012 | Yeah . So essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little Bayes - nets of their own .
[37:11] mn015 | Yep .
[37:13] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[37:13] mn015 | Precisely .
[37:19] mn015 | So .
[37:19] me003 | One thing that 's kind of been bugging me
[37:27] me003 | there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output .
[37:31] me012 | Yeah .
"[37:34] me003 | I mean , it makes it cleaner , but then uh I mean ."
[37:34] me012 | That 's true .
[37:36] me003 | For instance if
"[37:38] me003 | the discourse does well for instance , the "" discourse admission fee "" node"
[37:38] fe004 | What do you mean by that ?
[37:41] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[37:42] me003 | seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of "" enter directly "" versus "" going there via tourist "" ."
"[37:51] me012 | Yeah . Or we could like add more , uh ,"
[37:53] me012 | sort of middle nodes . Like we could add a node like
"[37:56] me012 | do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door ."
[37:59] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[38:02] me003 | Right .
[38:03] me012 | There are Those are the two options . Either like make an arrow directly or put a new node .
[38:05] fe004 | Hmm .
"[38:05] me003 | Yeah , that makes sense ."
[38:07] mn015 | Yeah .
[38:09] mn015 | If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like
"[38:13] mn015 | "" So how much has it cost to enter ? "" and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars ,"
[38:18] mn015 | and then the persons says
"[38:19] mn015 | um "" Yeah I want to see it . """
[38:22] mn015 | Yeah ?
[38:26] me003 | There are places in Germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter ?
"[38:30] mn015 | Um , nothing comes to mind ."
"[38:33] mn015 | Without thinking too hard . Um , maybe , yeah of course , um opera premiers ."
[38:39] me003 | Really ?
[38:40] mn015 | So you know .
[38:41] fe004 | Hmm .
[38:42] mn015 | Or or any good old Pink Floyd concert .
[38:42] me003 | I see .
"[38:44] me003 | If you want to see "" The Magic Flute "" or something ."
[38:45] mn015 | Yeah .
"[38:46] fe004 | Or maybe um , a famous restaurant . or , I don't know . There are various things that you might w not want to eat a meal there but your own table ."
[38:49] me003 | The Spagos of Heidelberg .
[38:53] mn015 | I think that the h I mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in Japan .
"[38:58] mn015 | So there , two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque ."
[39:02] mn015 | You know .
[39:03] me012 | Really .
"[39:03] mn015 | Then again ,"
[39:04] mn015 | everything else is free then once you 're ins in there .
[39:06] mn015 | Food and drink and so forth . So .
[39:08] mn015 | I mean .
[39:15] mn015 | is s
"[39:19] mn015 | still ,"
[39:21] me003 | Hmm .
[39:21] mn015 | based on that result is never going to enter that building . You know ? Because it 's just too expensive .
"[39:28] me003 | Oh yeah , I think I see ."
"[39:29] me003 | So the discourse refers to "" admission fee "" but it just turns out that"
[39:33] me003 | they change their mind in the middle of the discourse .
[39:39] me003 | Right .
[39:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:46] fe004 | whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . I mean ."
[39:50] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:58] mn015 | It works like this . The uh ,"
[40:03] mn015 | I mean .
[40:06] mn015 | already the intention is sort of t
"[40:08] mn015 | They tried to figure out the intention , right ?"
[40:09] mn015 | simply by parsing it .
[40:12] mn015 | And this um m
"[40:13] mn015 | won't differentiate between all modes , yeah ?"
"[40:19] mn015 | somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out"
"[40:23] mn015 | what kind of going there is is is happening ,"
"[40:27] mn015 | and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed ,"
"[40:32] mn015 | what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is ,"
"[40:40] mn015 | elaborate modules . It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system ,"
"[40:52] mn015 | and it fills in all the structures that are omitted ,"
"[40:58] mn015 | because you say "" OK , how can I get to the castle ?"
"[41:00] mn015 | "" Oh , how how much is it ? """
"[41:07] mn015 | to g let 's do it "" and so forth ."
[41:11] mn015 | anaphora somebody has to make sure that
[41:13] mn015 | information we had earlier on is still here .
[41:17] me003 | Mm - hmm .
[41:17] mn015 | Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened .
"[41:21] mn015 | so whenever the uh ,"
"[41:23] mn015 | um person is not actually rejecting what happened before ,"
[41:26] mn015 | so as in
"[41:27] mn015 | "" No I really don't want to see that movie ."
"[41:30] mn015 | I 'd rather stay home and watch TV """
[41:34] mn015 | What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of
[41:38] mn015 | added into the disc into the representations
"[41:44] mn015 | discourse model , Yeah , that 's what it 's called ."
"[41:47] mn015 | and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating"
"[41:54] mn015 | the gesture screen issues . So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know ,"
[41:59] me003 | Hmm .
[42:11] mn015 | sort of It has a very clear interface . We can query it
[42:14] mn015 | whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know
[42:21] me003 | OK .
[42:27] mn015 | Um but
"[42:29] mn015 | try to keep in mind that ,"
"[42:30] mn015 | you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit"
"[42:34] mn015 | that 's reasonable and not go ,"
"[42:36] mn015 | you know ,"
[42:37] mn015 | all the way back to Adam and Eve .
[42:41] mn015 | fees in his entire life ?
[42:47] mn015 | concise and Anyway .
[42:56] fe004 | is thinking about the plans that various people might have .
"[43:03] fe004 | OK . This person is um ,"
"[43:30] fe004 | "" OK , wha what plans is this a consistent with ? """
[43:39] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[43:41] me003 | Hmm .
[43:41] fe004 | figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that .
[43:42] mn015 | u u
[43:43] mn015 | It 's in the these these these plan schemas .
"[43:46] mn015 | I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate , you know ."
"[43:49] mn015 | "" What do you need need to buy a ticket ? "" You know ?"
[43:50] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[43:51] mn015 | and it it 's fifty steps , huh ?"
[43:53] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:54] mn015 | just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter ,"
"[44:00] mn015 | It 's amazing what human beings can do . W when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r"
[44:11] mn015 | New York
[44:13] mn015 | and you say
"[44:14] mn015 | Track seven , huh ?"
"[44:15] mn015 | And it 's because you know that that person actually is following ,"
"[44:19] mn015 | You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps ,"
"[44:22] mn015 | you know , without any information other than "" New York "" , huh ?"
"[44:26] mn015 | inferring everything from the context . So ,"
[44:28] mn015 | works .
"[44:31] mn015 | Um , even though there is probably no train from here to New York , right ?"
[44:35] fe004 | Mmm . Not direct .
[44:37] me003 | You 'd uh probably have to transfer in Chicago .
[44:39] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[44:43] mn015 | But uh it 's possible .
"[44:44] mn015 | Um , no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else ."
[44:48] mn015 | Right ?
"[44:49] mn015 | Is that t San Francisco , Chicago ?"
[44:50] mn015 | Is that possible ?
"[44:53] me003 | One time I saw a report on trains ,"
[44:56] me003 | and I think there is a l
[44:57] me003 | I don't know if I thought there was a line that went from
"[45:00] me003 | somewhere , maybe it was Sacramento to Chicago , but there was like a California to Chicago line of some sort ."
[45:02] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[45:03] mn015 | Hmm .
[45:06] me003 | I could be wrong though . It was a while ago .
[45:11] fe004 | I think it has to exist somewhere .
[45:12] me003 | They might have blown it up .
"[45:15] mn015 | Well it never went all the way , right ? I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha , right ?"
[45:17] fe004 | Well most of the way . Uh .
[45:19] mn015 | One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that
[45:20] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[45:27] mn015 | yeah ?
[45:29] mn015 | Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak ?
[45:32] fe004 | I have . But not transcontinentally .
[45:35] me012 | Yeah .
[45:35] me003 | I 'm frightened by Amtrak myself .
[45:38] me012 | What ? Why ?
[45:40] me003 | They seem to have a lot of accidents on the Amtrak .
[45:42] me012 | Really ?
[45:43] mn015 | Their reputation is very bad . huh ?
[45:43] me003 | Yeah .
[45:44] me003 | Yeah .
[45:45] mn015 | It 's not maybe reality .
[45:47] fe004 | Like German trains are really great so .
"[45:53] mn015 | which ones are safer ,"
"[45:54] mn015 | you know , statistically ."
"[45:54] fe004 | Um , but they 're faster ."
[45:56] me012 | @ @
[45:58] me012 | Yeah .
[45:58] mn015 | Much faster . Mm - hmm .
"[46:00] me012 | And there 's much more of them . Yeah , they 're"
"[46:03] me012 | Yeah , it 's way better"
[46:03] mn015 | yeah
[46:07] mn015 | and I was surprised .
[46:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[46:08] mn015 | It was actually OK .
"[46:09] mn015 | You know , on Boston New York , New York Rhode Island , whatever , Boston ."
[46:09] fe004 | Yeah .
[46:11] me012 | Yeah .
[46:12] me012 | I 've done that kind of thing .
[46:13] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[46:15] mn015 | Yeah .
[46:19] mn015 | That 's a different issue .
[46:21] me003 | This is going to be an interesting transcript .
[46:24] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[46:24] me012 | I I want to see what it does with uh "" landmark - iness "" ."
[46:28] me003 | Yeah .
[46:33] me012 | So .
[46:34] me003 | It 'd help it figure it out .
[46:35] fe004 | Right .
[46:36] me012 | Yeah .
"[46:54] fe004 | um , I don't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based ."
[46:57] me003 | Hmm .
[47:00] fe004 | m more than one way of organizing the variables into something so .
"[47:06] mn015 | What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks ,"
[47:10] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[47:10] mn015 | and maybe some of their conditions .
[47:12] mn015 | One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s
[47:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[47:31] mn015 | what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based
[47:33] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[47:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:35] mn015 | and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based ."
[47:38] fe004 | That feed into those ?
[47:39] mn015 | Nah ?
[47:39] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[47:40] mn015 | Might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world .
"[47:44] mn015 | So ,"
[47:46] mn015 | um
[47:52] mn015 | maybe throughout this week
"[47:54] mn015 | the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions ,"
[47:59] mn015 | and we make up some some toy
[48:02] mn015 | a
[48:04] mn015 | observable
"[48:07] mn015 | "" nodes "" is that what th"
[48:08] me012 | OK .
[48:09] mn015 | What 's the technical term ?
[48:10] me012 | For which ?
"[48:13] mn015 | The "" outer layer "" ?"
[48:18] me012 | Yeah .
[48:25] mn015 | middle layer for those .
[48:30] me012 | Yeah .
[48:31] me003 | Basically just refine some of the
[48:34] mn015 | Yep .
"[48:34] me012 | Yeah , this is totally like The probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . We need to look at all of them ."
[48:34] me003 | more general nodes .
"[48:43] me012 | I mean like , close to the end we were like , uh ,"
[48:59] fe004 | And That 's terrible .
[49:16] me012 | something to that effect .
"[49:22] me012 | Yeah , another thing to do , um , is also to , um I guess to ask around people about other Bayes - net packages ."
"[49:29] me012 | Is Srini gonna be at the meeting tomorrow , do you know ?"
[49:32] fe004 | Maybe .
[49:33] mn015 | The day after tomorrow . Wednesday .
[49:34] me012 | Day after tomorrow . Yeah .
[49:36] me012 | Maybe we can ask him about it .
[49:36] me003 | Who 's talking on Wednesday ?
[49:40] fe004 | Mmm .
"[49:41] me003 | J Jerry never sent out a sent out an email , did he , ever ?"
"[49:45] me012 | No . But he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking , I forget who . Uh ."
"[49:49] mn015 | Oh , isn't Ben ?"
"[49:50] fe004 | Ben ? I think it 's Ben actually , yeah ,"
"[49:50] mn015 | Ben , then , Ben ."
[49:51] me003 | Ah !
"[49:53] fe004 | um ,"
[49:54] fe004 | giving his job talk I think .
[50:06] me003 | Yeah .
[50:09] mn015 | That will be one one thing we could do .
[50:17] me003 | Right .
[50:18] mn015 | I actually wanted to show that to you guys now but um .
[50:22] me003 | Do you want to trade ?
"[50:24] mn015 | I actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's it doesn't wake up ever , so I had to reboot"
"[50:33] fe004 | Oh , no ."
"[50:34] mn015 | And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom ,"
[50:44] me012 | But . OK . But once you start sart start SmartKom you can be on You don't have to be on a network anymore . Is that the deal ?
[50:50] mn015 | Yep .
"[50:51] me012 | Ah , interesting ."
[50:53] me003 | Why does SmartKom need a network ?
"[51:07] mn015 | you know , my computer does not know its IP address ,"
[51:09] mn015 | you know ?
[51:09] me003 | Ah .
[51:10] mn015 | You know . So .
[51:11] mn015 | Unless it boots up with networking .
[51:12] me003 | It 's plugged in . Yeah .
"[51:18] mn015 | they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth ."
[51:22] fe004 | Hmm .
[51:25] mn015 | Always fun .
"[51:26] mn015 | But it 's a , um ,"
"[51:29] mn015 | simple solution . We can just um ,"
"[51:38] mn015 | oh yeah ,"
"[51:40] mn015 | um , data collection ."
"[51:42] mn015 | We interviewed Fey ,"
[51:44] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:45] mn015 | She 's willing to do it ,"
[51:48] mn015 | meaning be the wizard
"[51:52] mn015 | maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to ,"
"[51:55] mn015 | but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth ."
"[52:06] mn015 | see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard ."
[52:16] mn015 | And I talked to Liz about this and it looks as if Friday afternoon
[52:23] mn015 | will be the time when we have a first trial run
[52:26] me012 | So who would be the subject of this trial run ?
[52:26] mn015 | for the data .
[52:29] mn015 | Pardon me ?
"[52:34] mn015 | Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject ,"
[52:37] fe004 | Good .
[52:38] mn015 | which I think might be even better than us guys .
"[52:41] me003 | One of us , yeah ."
"[52:42] mn015 | If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in ."
[52:52] me003 | you guys have successfully narrowed it down .
"[53:02] me012 | Well I just figured it has to be someone who 's , um ,"
"[53:04] me012 | familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard ,"
"[53:06] me012 | so we can , uh , see if they 're you know"
[53:09] me012 | good .
[53:09] fe004 | Oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult
[53:13] me012 | Yeah .
"[53:13] me012 | I mean that 's what we wanna check , right ?"
[53:13] fe004 | things .
"[53:16] mn015 | Um ,"
[53:21] me012 | Isn't that what it is ?
"[53:23] mn015 | yes w we we would like to test the wizard ,"
"[53:26] mn015 | but you know , if we take a subject that is completely"
"[53:30] mn015 | unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic"
[53:32] me012 | I guess that would be reasonable .
[53:34] fe004 | Yeah .
[53:35] me003 | Yeah .
[53:39] mn015 | Yeah .
[53:42] fe004 | That might be a little unfair .
[53:44] fe004 | Um .
[53:45] mn015 | Yeah .
"[53:46] fe004 | I 'm sure if we uh , You think there 's a chance we might need Liz for ,"
"[53:55] fe004 | um ,"
[53:55] fe004 | if we want another subject . You know . Like I can drag Ben into it or something .
"[53:56] mn015 | Yeah , yeah ."
[54:01] fe004 | Although he might cause problems but .
"[54:13] fe004 | So , is it a experimental setup for the"
"[54:15] me003 | I like that . "" Test the wizard . """
[54:17] me003 | I want that on a T - shirt .
[54:22] fe004 | determined ?
"[54:24] mn015 | experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st"
"[54:28] mn015 | I think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard ,"
[54:31] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:33] mn015 | But um in terms of specifying the scenario ,"
[54:37] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:51] mn015 | So so if if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her ,"
[55:01] mn015 | getting all the details completely figured out .
[55:03] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[55:15] fe004 | will af affect Like we wanna we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that ,"
[55:22] fe004 | right ? in the course of the task ?
[55:25] fe004 | Well not all of them but you know .
"[55:31] mn015 | This this Tango , Enter , Vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario ."
[55:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[55:38] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[55:44] mn015 | data collection was the following .
[55:52] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[55:54] mn015 | Hardly anything complicated .
[55:56] mn015 | No metaphors whatsoever .
[55:57] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[55:58] mn015 | Not a rich language .
"[56:01] mn015 | So we wanted just to collect data ,"
"[56:05] mn015 | that elicits more ,"
"[56:07] mn015 | uh ,"
[56:07] mn015 | that elicits richer language .
[56:07] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[56:10] mn015 | And we actually did not want to constrain it
[56:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:13] mn015 | too much ,"
[56:13] mn015 | you know ? Just see what people say .
"[56:18] mn015 | the phenomena that we want to solve ,"
[56:21] mn015 | whatever engine we we come up with .
[56:24] mn015 | Um .
"[56:27] mn015 | this is a parallel track ,"
"[56:29] mn015 | you know ,"
"[56:29] mn015 | there they hopefully meet ,"
[56:34] mn015 | It should
"[56:35] mn015 | tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could"
"[56:37] mn015 | occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between"
[56:41] mn015 | people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being and the sort of differences there .
[56:44] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:47] mn015 | So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um ,"
"[56:53] mn015 | that no one knows anything about ,"
[56:55] mn015 | as of yesterday .
"[56:57] mn015 | And uh nothing has changed since then , so ."
"[57:02] mn015 | And secondly ,"
"[57:11] mn015 | we may actually include , you know ,"
[57:13] mn015 | those those intentions .
[57:16] mn015 | So now I think we should maybe have
[57:20] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:21] mn015 | uh not ex it 's implicit that the person wants to enter ,"
[57:24] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[57:25] mn015 | and maybe some task where it 's more or less explicit
"[57:29] mn015 | that the person wants to take a picture ,"
[57:31] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[57:32] mn015 | or see it or
[57:34] mn015 | something .
"[57:37] mn015 | So that we can label it . I mean ,"
[57:39] mn015 | that 's how we get a corpus that we can label .
[57:39] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:41] mn015 | Whereas , you know ,"
"[57:42] mn015 | if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted ,"
[57:45] mn015 | we 'd get no cues .
[57:52] mn015 | Yep .
[57:55] me003 | Alrighty .
[57:56] me012 | OK .
[58:00] me003 | So is this the official end of the meeting now ?
[58:03] me012 | Yep .
[58:03] fe004 | Looks like it .
"[58:04] me012 | So what 's "" Economics , the fallacy "" ?"
[58:07] mn015 | Ma -
[58:11] me003 | So that has nothing to do with economics or anything .
"[58:13] me012 | Oh , really ? OK ."

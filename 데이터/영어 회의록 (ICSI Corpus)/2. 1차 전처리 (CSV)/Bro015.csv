[00:18] me013 | Don't know which days yet . So hopefully he 'll have some intensive time to to work with people .
[00:30] me013 | we 're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here uh for some chunk of the summer .
[00:37] me013 | So that may or may not happen but if he does since actually Pratibha is going to be off at IBM um the uh effort will pretty much
"[00:51] me013 | shift here ,"
[00:58] me013 | So .
[01:02] me013 | That 's my news .
[01:07] me006 | Cool . I need a new office mate .
[01:09] me006 | Yeah .
[01:09] me006 | That 's cool .
"[01:15] mn007 | It will be some sometime in summer . July or August , or ."
"[01:18] me013 | Yeah , I mean it may not happen . I mean he wants uh I think he wants some experience someplace else and he 's he 's uh thinking of going someplace , but it 's I mean Pratibha is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here . So ."
[01:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:31] me013 | But y I don't know maybe June . Maybe earlier . But uh . Anyway , Hynek will be here next week and maybe he 'll know more about it ."
[01:58] mn007 | uh they are not decide on everything yet .
[02:14] mn007 | of the SpeechDat - Car and then take the same um end points
[02:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:25] mn007 | Uh g
"[02:26] mn007 | Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy . Mmm ."
[02:27] me013 | clean data . OK .
[02:41] me013 | a particular VAD which everybody would use ? or or just that everybody would use the same procedure ?
[02:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:54] mn007 | Um .
[02:55] me018 | So they would just provide that as part of the data .
[03:01] me013 | Yeah . Sounds like they 're still arguing . Yeah .
"[03:02] mn007 | Yeah , they 're still not decided ."
[03:06] me013 | Yeah .
[03:32] mn007 | It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean
[03:38] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[03:41] mn007 | parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now .
"[04:04] mn007 | Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also"
[04:22] mn007 | so there is nor significant improvement .
[04:32] mn007 | We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work so we 've not much
[04:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[04:38] me013 | Yeah you have a uh you have a lunch talk sometime in When is it ?
[04:38] mn007 | more results . Hmm .
[04:42] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:42] mn007 | It 's next week , yeah ."
"[04:43] me013 | Next week ? Oh , OK ."
[05:01] me018 | Ah .
[05:01] fn002 | I stopped it . Interfered . Yeah .
[05:02] me018 | You stopped working on it I see
[05:07] me013 | OK . Uh .
[05:11] me013 | So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit ? And and and trying to
[05:17] me013 | collate results ? and get something from it ?
[05:22] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:22] mn007 | Um . Yeah . Right now , Sunil seems i is in India actually . Uh so there is no progress apparently from their side neither ."
[05:26] me013 | Right .
[05:40] me013 | I mean . Uh . Who 's who 's was uh looking at the combination of uh spectral s subtraction approaches with what we had for instance .
[05:52] me013 | OK .
"[05:55] mn007 | He sent a bunch of a bunch of results uh but I don't know what 's the status of this . I guess it was just the result that he sent , so . Um ."
[06:05] me013 | What was that again ?
[06:14] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:16] mn007 | And it was not
"[06:27] mn007 | it did not improve further , putting the on - line normalization , so ."
[06:34] me013 | Hmm .
"[06:46] me013 | Yeah . I uh , I g so I guess nothing has ever happened about uh making a standardized uh place where the software sits so that people can work with it , and upgrade it ?"
"[07:03] mn007 | Well , we know most what we have to to put in in this . And ."
"[07:11] mn007 | So , I guess . Yeah , we m"
[07:18] me013 | Um . OK .
"[07:20] me013 | Um . Chuck , did you get a chance to do anymore stuff with the uh"
"[07:29] me018 | Uh , no . This week I haven't . I 've been my whole time 's been taken up with uh Meeting Recorder stuff ."
[07:35] me013 | u
[07:38] me013 | This may be a very short meeting . Uh . Um .
[07:46] me013 | your side ?
[07:49] me006 | Uh . We 're doing some background reading on phonetics .
[07:49] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[08:05] me026 | subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude over a two second window . But they didn't do anything with the phase ,"
[08:17] me026 | So I 'm I 'm going to start thinking about um ways that the ph that the phase could be used .
[08:24] me026 | Um . Si - if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive .
[08:35] me026 | So um perhaps just subtracting the mean of the phase would would help .
[08:42] me026 | Um but I don't know I th I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they weren't successful .
[08:56] me013 | OK .
[09:14] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:36] me013 | Sure . Wh - who 's they they ?
"[09:38] me018 | Uh , I don't know who did it do you know , Stephane ? Who did that ?"
[09:40] mn007 | Um .
[09:52] me013 | Mmm .
"[10:17] me018 | all different of kinds of variations , and that would let us , you know , pump through a lot more experiments . So um I still have to to send everybody a"
[10:43] me018 | Oh !
[10:44] me018 | The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state .
[10:51] me018 | And so .
[10:51] mn007 | Uh .
[10:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:52] mn007 | I think it 's was playing with the number of states per word . They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen ."
[11:05] me018 | OK . I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder
[11:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:08] me018 | what
"[11:11] me018 | Oh , OK . I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states . OK ."
"[11:15] mn007 | Yeah , apparently ,"
[11:16] mn007 | um they had better results when they increased the number of states .
[11:24] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[11:27] me018 | Yeah .
"[11:39] me018 | uh make the silence model more powerful , you know , increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states , different different things like that , so . That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance"
[11:55] me013 | Um .
"[11:57] me013 | Why don't why don't we uh if there aren't any other major things , why don't we do the digits , and then then uh turn the mikes off ."
[12:09] me013 | So I 'll start .
[14:22] fn002 | This .
[14:27] fn002 | Yeah .
[14:28] mn007 | Hmm .

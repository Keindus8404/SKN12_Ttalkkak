"[00:10] me003 | Yeah , I think I got my mike on ."
[00:14] me003 | OK .
[00:17] me003 | Let 's see .
"[01:10] me010 | OK . Ami , do yours then we 'll open it and I think it 'll be enough ."
"[01:20] me003 | Mmm Doesn't , uh It should be the other way . Yeah , now it 's on ."
[01:23] mn036 | Right . OK .
"[02:20] me010 | OK . So , we all switched on ?"
[02:25] mn036 | We are all switched on .
"[02:51] me010 | What we think is gonna happen is that ,"
"[03:00] me010 | to ,"
"[03:12] me010 | And then there 'll be a certain number of um , hours during the week which she will be available and we 'll bring in"
"[03:19] me010 | people . Uh , roughly how many , Robert ?"
[03:21] me010 | We d Do we know ?
"[03:22] me010 | OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people , not necessarily by any means all students but we 'll s we 'll start with with that ."
"[03:35] me010 | And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon"
"[03:39] me010 | Uh , with uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out ."
[03:50] me010 | is to s
"[03:50] me010 | to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week ."
"[03:55] me010 | The week after that 's Spring Break , and maybe we 'll look for them some subjects next door or i"
[03:59] mn015 | Yeah .
"[04:00] mn015 | Yeah . Also , Fey will not be here during spring break . So ."
"[04:02] me010 | Oh , OK , then we won't do it . OK . So that 's easy ."
"[04:09] me010 | So , is Is that"
[04:11] me010 | make sense to everybody ?
[04:44] mn015 | and get them interested in
[04:46] me010 | That 's a good idea .
[04:49] mn015 | So that 's as far as our brainstorming was concerned .
"[04:52] me010 | Oh , yeah . The high school 's a great idea ."
[04:58] mn015 | So .
"[05:10] mn015 | And , um ,"
"[05:18] me010 | Uh , th I think they 're necessary ."
[05:21] mn015 | Mmm . Nuh .
[05:26] mn015 | N .
[05:28] mn015 | You happy with that ?
"[05:29] me010 | Well , yeah . There 's one tricky part"
"[05:31] me010 | about ,"
"[05:37] me010 | I The last paragraph "" if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . """
"[05:44] me010 | OK ? Now that , we had to be included for this"
"[05:48] me010 | other one which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something . In this case , it doesn't really make sense ."
[05:49] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:55] me010 | Um , so what I 'd like to do"
[05:58] me010 | is also have our subjects sign a waiver
"[06:02] me010 | saying "" I don't want to see the final transcript "" ."
[06:04] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:04] me010 | And if they don't If they say "" no , I 'm not willing to sign that "" , then we 'll show them the final transcript . But , um ."
[06:10] mn015 | Yep . Makes sense .
"[06:17] me010 | S i Jane may say that , "" you know , you can't do this "" , uh ,"
"[06:20] me010 | "" on the same form , we need a separate form . "" But anyway . I 'd I 'd I 'd like to ,"
"[06:25] me010 | e e um , add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial , saying "" nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . "" But other than that , that 's one 's been approved ,"
[06:27] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:33] me010 | this really is the same project ,"
"[06:36] me010 | uh , rec you know . And so forth . So I think we just go with it ."
[06:38] mn015 | Yeah .
[06:39] mn015 | Yeah .
[06:47] mn015 | OK .
[06:51] mn015 | except that with Munich everything is fine now .
"[06:53] mn015 | They 're gonna transcribe . They 're also gonna translate the , uh , German data from the"
[06:58] mn015 | TV and cinema stuff for Andreas . So .
[07:11] me010 | Yep .
[07:12] mn015 | Well I guess the good good news of last week was the parser .
"[07:30] mn015 | It , uh I didn't measure it , but it was about an hour and ten minutes ."
[07:34] me012 | Yep . Something like that .
"[07:34] mn015 | And , um and now it 's We have a complete English parser that does everything the German parser does ."
[07:44] me012 | Yes .
[07:50] me012 | We 'll show you .
[07:50] fe004 | interesting about it at all ? or are we gonna see that ?
"[07:51] me010 | Yeah , we can show us , right ?"
"[07:52] mn015 | Well , w w"
[08:00] me010 | Yep .
[08:01] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[08:05] fe004 | OK .
[08:07] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:07] mn015 | And , uh , the reason was that the parser i c"
"[08:20] mn015 | um , even if you leave out , um ,"
[08:24] mn015 | all all of this . So it 's basically feature film and TV .
"[08:29] fe004 | Today OK . And the t and the time , right ?"
[08:35] fe004 | OK .
[08:39] mn015 | and it 's optional for that parser .

"[08:48] fe004 | "" The former end g "" Oh , I see . Uh - huh ."
"[08:52] mn015 | do this now ,"

"[09:14] fe004 | OK . Key words , e basically ."
"[09:19] me010 | Actually , it 's a little tricky ,"
[09:22] me010 | in that there 's some

[09:30] me012 | No .
[09:30] mn015 | No .

"[10:24] mn015 | Except that we d w we don't have this , uh , time information here now , which is ,"
[10:34] mn015 | Oh . This are the reserve .
[10:36] mn015 | So .
[10:38] mn015 | Um .
[10:39] mn015 | These are the sort of the ten different sentence types
[10:49] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:52] mn015 | And , um"
"[10:55] mn015 | you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate , right ?"

"[11:05] me012 | many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine ."
[11:11] me010 | OK .

[11:43] mn015 | Yep .

[13:02] mn015 | it is .
[13:03] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[13:04] me010 | OK .
"[13:09] mn015 | So we we shouldn't belittle it too much . It 's doing something ,"

[13:40] me012 | Right .
[13:40] mn015 | I hope .

"[14:16] me012 | Are they going to be called ? Um , are they present in the code for the parser ?"

"[14:32] mn015 | So what it probably does , is it takes the , uh ,"
"[14:47] mn015 | This is where it takes its own , um , syntax ,"
[15:04] me012 | What are you looking for ?
"[15:06] mn015 | Um , where it actually produces the the XML out of the , uh , parsed stuff ."
"[15:28] mn015 | You mean , where the where the act how the action "" Goodbye """
"[15:35] me003 | Yeah , where are those constructors defined ?"

"[16:11] mn015 | I saw those actions uh , the "" Goodbye "" stuff somewhere ."
[16:17] me003 | Grep for it ?
[16:19] mn015 | Yeah .
[16:20] mn015 | Let 's do that .

[16:49] me012 | Mmm .
[16:49] me012 | M - three - L dot DTD ?
[16:50] mn015 | Yep .
[17:06] me012 | specification for the XML

"[17:50] mn015 | So , whenever it it encounters "" Goodbye "" ,"
[17:57] me003 | That function automatically generates an initialized

[18:09] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[18:11] me010 | there were other actions

[18:26] me010 | I think that 's right . I think it 's actually That looks like it 's state modification .

[18:48] mn015 | Yep .
[18:49] me010 | Uh - huh !
[18:52] me010 | I 'm not I 'm not sure .
"[18:55] mn015 | Um well , we we 'll see , when we say ,"
"[18:58] mn015 | "" Goodbye "" ,"

[21:37] me010 | It 's worth
[21:39] me010 | the exercise of trying to
[21:42] me010 | actually add something
[21:43] me010 | that isn't there .
[21:45] mn015 | Hmm ?
[21:47] me010 | Disc -
"[21:53] me010 | um , figuring out how to add our own"

"[22:19] mn015 | Hmm . Interesting . It 's just going up , it 's not going"
"[22:31] mn015 | So , this is um , what I got today is the the new um M - three - L for"
"[22:44] mn015 | uh , and with some examples So , this is the XML and this is sort of what it will look like later on ,"
"[22:52] mn015 | And this is what it sort of is the the structure of Map requests ,"
"[23:01] mn015 | and here is the more interesting stuff for us , is the routes ,"
"[23:13] mn015 | um , parameters . We have"
"[23:18] mn015 | simple "" from objects "" and "" to objects "" and so forth ,"
"[23:24] mn015 | And , um ,"
[23:38] mn015 | It seems to me that some notions were missing .
[23:44] mn015 | Yep . Who are doing this .
[23:45] me010 | So this is not a complicated negotiation .
"[23:53] me010 | It 's a design thing , not a political thing ."
[23:55] me010 | Once we 've eh We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done .
[23:59] me010 | Good .
"[24:05] mn015 | e So that you understand , it is really simple . Uh You you have a route , and you cut it up in different pieces ."
"[24:14] mn015 | Every segment we call a "" route element "" ."
"[24:17] mn015 | And so , from A to B we cut up in three different steps ,"
"[24:21] mn015 | and every step has a "" from object "" where you start , a "" to object "" where y where you sort of end , and some points of interest along the way ."
"[24:28] mn015 | What w I was sort of missing here , and uh , maybe it was just me being too stupid , is , I didn't sort of get the the notion of the global goal"
"[25:02] mn015 | And also ,"
[25:15] mn015 | of how we can do it .
"[25:26] mn015 | And the Approach mode , anyhow , is the default ."
[25:31] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[25:39] mn015 | @ @
[25:41] mn015 | So .
"[25:54] me010 | You 're in the midst of this , so you know better . But it seems to me it 's probably"
[25:57] me010 | a good idea to
[25:59] me010 | li uh minimize the number of
"[26:01] me010 | uh , change requests we make of them ."
"[26:08] me010 | OK ? And think about it some , internally , before"
[26:12] me010 | asking them to make changes .
[26:15] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[26:30] me010 | And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it . Probably Johno .
"[26:34] me010 | Uh , take what they have ,"
"[26:38] me010 | send it to everybody saying "" this is what they have , this is what we think we should add "" ,"
"[26:42] me010 | OK ? and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying "" Hmm , well """
[26:46] me010 | OK ? And get our best idea of what we should add .
[26:49] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[26:50] me010 | And then go back to them .
"[26:57] mn015 | Sort of , what I my feeling was eh we we sort of reserved something that has a r eh"
[27:07] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[27:08] mn015 | I w
"[27:11] mn015 | this is sort of our playground . And if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and and and and and complex enough to to to maybe enable a whole simulation ,"
[27:13] me010 | Right .
[27:22] me010 | Right .
"[27:22] mn015 | one of these days ,"
[27:39] me010 | that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ?
[27:41] mn015 | Mm - hmm . Yep .
[27:42] me010 | Right . And that re that requires some thought .
[27:45] mn015 | Yep .
[27:49] me010 | as the priority item
"[27:52] me010 | um , as soon as we can do it ."
[27:54] mn015 | Yep .
[27:55] me010 | So y so you guys will send to the rest of us
"[28:03] me010 | um , this ,"
"[28:09] me010 | Well b Yeah . So , the the uh Not everyone"
"[28:12] me010 | uh , reads German , so if you 'd"
[28:16] me003 | Mmm .

"[28:26] me010 | Then then , yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ?"
[28:31] me003 | OK .

"[28:49] me003 | Approach and Vis - or Vista . Yeah , yeah ."
"[28:50] me010 | Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . This is this is everything that that ,"
"[28:55] me003 | Yeah , yeah ."
[28:57] me010 | we might want to do in the next couple years .
[29:00] me003 | So what would OK .
[29:00] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[29:04] me010 | We don't I mean , that 's an issue . We don't know what , entirely ."
[29:12] me003 | this

[29:18] me003 | traveling through Heidelberg .

"[29:23] me003 | So , but this O Is the domain greater than that ?"
[29:26] me003 | OK .
[29:39] me010 | all the complexity we want in actions and in language
[29:43] me010 | without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg .
"[29:48] me010 | But you know , i depending on what people are interested in ,"
"[29:55] me010 | um , explanations of why something is is , you know , why why was this done , or I mean , no there 's no end"
"[30:05] me010 | uh , what a tourist in Heidelberg might"
[30:07] me003 | Mmm .
[30:12] me010 | the general domain
[30:14] me010 | we don't have t to
"[30:16] me010 | uh , broaden ."
"[30:19] me010 | That is , tourists in Heidelberg ."
"[30:43] me010 | uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great ."
[30:47] mn036 | OK .
"[30:48] me010 | OK , so this is his specialty is reference ,"
[30:50] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:55] me010 | anaphora , but , uh , more generally the ,"
"[30:59] me010 | this whole issue of ,"
"[31:01] me010 | uh , referring expressions , and , what is it that they 're actually"
[31:06] me010 | dealing with in the world ?
[31:07] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:08] me010 | And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed because there is an ontology ,"
[31:20] mn036 | Right .
[31:22] me010 | All the entities
[31:24] me010 | do have concrete reference . Although th the To get at them from a language may not be trivial .
[31:25] mn036 | Right .
[31:29] me010 | There aren't
[31:30] me010 | really deep mysteries about
"[31:33] me010 | um , what w what things the system knows about ."
[31:36] mn036 | Right . And you have both proper names and descriptions and y and you can ask for it .
"[31:39] me010 | All those things . Yeah . You have proper names , and descriptions ."
[31:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[31:42] mn036 | Right . OK .
[31:43] mn015 | Nuh .
[31:45] mn036 | Right .
[31:46] mn036 | Right .
[31:47] me010 | all those things .
"[31:55] mn015 | We have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it , IE the e"
"[32:13] mn015 | there . But did y I uh I think there will be great because the reference problem really is not trivial , even if you have such a g"
[32:20] mn015 | well - defined world .
[32:26] me003 | Could you give me an example of a reference problem ? so so l I can make it more concrete ?
"[32:32] mn015 | We sort of t think that our bit in this problem is interesting , but , just to get from Powder - Tower to an object I ID in a database"
[32:55] me010 | Yeah .
[32:58] mn036 | Right .
"[33:00] me010 | Yeah , that would be fine ."
[33:01] mn036 | Right .
[33:02] me010 | Yeah .
[33:02] mn036 | Right .
[33:07] me003 | OK .
"[33:12] me003 | Yeah , yeah ."
[33:13] me010 | OK .
"[33:25] me010 | dive into . What ,"
"[33:34] me010 | let 's say that by the end of spring break ,"
"[33:39] me010 | general story about ,"
"[33:42] me010 | um , construction grammar , and what constructions we 'd use and how all this might"
"[33:59] me010 | I want to do that early , rather than late ."
[34:02] me010 | And you and I will probably have to talk about this some .
"[34:08] mn015 | Something , uh , maybe we should address one of these days , is to That most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements ,"
"[34:21] mn015 | But the whole i is it is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with , sort of , questions ?"
[34:29] mn015 | And this is It seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l
[34:36] mn015 | this is special case in that sense .
[34:38] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:44] mn015 | You know Did we ever find m metaphorical use in in questions in in that sense , really ?"
[34:49] me010 | Yeah .
[34:50] me010 | You will .
"[34:51] mn015 | And how soon , I don't know ."
"[34:52] me010 | Oh , yeah ."
"[34:54] me010 | I mean , uh , we could take"
[34:56] me010 | all the standard metaphor examples and make question
[34:59] me010 | versions of them .
[35:01] me010 | OK .
[35:02] mn036 | Muh -
"[35:02] mn015 | "" Who got kicked out of France ? "" Nuh ."
[35:04] mn036 | Right .
[35:06] mn015 | Nuh .
[35:09] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:13] me010 | uh , it 's at all"
"[35:16] me010 | Uh , to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time ,"
[35:30] me010 | I d
"[35:31] me010 | We don't know how to handle the declarative forms ,"
"[35:34] me010 | really ,"
[35:40] me010 | Uh .
"[35:41] me010 | Yeah . Nancy , it looked like you were s"
"[35:50] fe004 | most of the things we talked about are our story understanding . Uh , we 're gonna have a short discourse and the person talking is trying to ,"
[35:52] me010 | Right .
"[35:58] mn015 | Help you create a mental model , blah - blah - blah . Yeah ."
[36:01] me010 | Yes .
"[36:08] fe004 | you know , that we have to recognize or , you know , infer ."
[36:14] fe004 | don't follo follow quite as many
"[36:20] me010 | over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario ."
[36:23] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[36:26] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:29] me010 | what it looks like . What is the simspec mean , et cetera ."
[36:29] fe004 | Mm - hmm . M
"[36:41] me010 | Well , I don't know . I mean , maybe maybe that 's what we 'll do is is s u e"
"[36:45] me010 | We can do anything we want with it . I mean , once we have fulfilled these requirements ,"
[36:46] fe004 | Yep . Mmm Mm - hmm .
"[36:52] me010 | OK , and the one for next"
"[36:55] me010 | uh , summer is just"
"[36:56] me010 | half done and then the other half is this ,"
"[36:59] me010 | um ,"
"[37:00] me010 | "" generation thing "" which we think isn't much different ."
"[37:02] me010 | So once that 's done ,"
"[37:04] me010 | then all the rest of it is ,"
"[37:05] me010 | uh , sort of ,"
"[37:06] me010 | you know , what we want to do for the research ."
[37:09] me010 | And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their
[37:13] me010 | framework at all .
[37:15] me010 | Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that .
[37:15] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:18] me010 | If we can use all the , uh ,"
"[37:21] me010 | execution engines ,"
"[37:22] me010 | then we can ,"
"[37:23] me010 | you know , really"
[37:25] me010 | try things that
[37:26] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:31] me010 | So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg ,"
[37:35] me010 | we can do that .
[37:46] mn015 | w
"[37:46] mn015 | e w a Assuming we have this , um , we we ta in that case we actually do have these wonderful stories , and historical anecdotes , and"
[37:50] me010 | Yeah .
[37:53] fe004 | Mmm .
"[38:00] mn015 | and if we want to answer a question on that ,"
"[38:03] mn015 | we actually have to go one step before that , and understand that ."
[38:07] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[38:08] fe004 | Yeah .
[38:10] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:11] me010 | You might , yeah ."
[38:20] mn015 | how can we sort of
"[38:21] mn015 | run our our text , our content , through a machine that will enable us , later , to"
[38:25] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[38:27] mn015 | retrieve or answer e questions more sensibly ?
[38:28] fe004 | Mmm .
[38:30] me010 | Anyway . S
[38:31] me010 | Who 's going ?
"[38:31] mn036 | So , uh So , uh , I was just going to ask , um , so ,"
[38:39] me010 | Ah !
"[38:41] me010 | OK . So eh Yeah . So , what happened is ,"
"[38:44] me010 | there 's this , eh , uh Robert was describing"
"[38:47] me010 | the There 's two packages there 's a ,"
"[38:50] me010 | uh , quote parser , there 's a particular piece"
"[38:53] me010 | of this big system , which , in German ,"
"[38:56] me010 | uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures ."
[39:00] mn036 | Right .
[39:01] me010 | And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that .
"[39:05] me010 | That , these guys did in a in a day ."
[39:08] mn036 | Right .
"[39:08] me010 | The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level ,"
"[39:12] me010 | there 's something that takes ,"
"[39:14] me010 | uh , X M L structures ,"
[39:16] me010 | produces an output XML structure which is
[39:19] me010 | instructions for the generator .
[39:21] mn036 | Right .
"[39:21] me010 | OK ? And then there 's a language generator , and then after that a s a synthesizer that"
"[39:26] me010 | goes from an XML structure to ,"
"[39:29] me010 | uh , language generation , to"
[39:32] me010 | actual specifications for a synthesizer .
"[39:34] me010 | Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one"
[39:34] mn036 | Right .
[39:38] me010 | piece
[39:39] me010 | that we have to convert to English .
[39:42] mn036 | Right .
"[39:50] me010 | a m a minor thing ,"
[39:53] mn036 | Right . Right . That 's great !
[39:54] me010 | OK ?
"[39:55] me010 | And much more interesting is the fact that ,"
"[40:01] me010 | you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other"
[40:04] mn036 | Right .
[40:05] me010 | things .
[40:11] me010 | it gets difficult . And I I don't pretend to understand yet what I think
[40:16] me010 | we really ought to do .
[40:21] mn015 | OK .
"[40:22] mn015 | So , e enough of that ,"
"[40:24] mn015 | but I , uh , um ,"
"[40:26] mn015 | mmm ,"
"[40:28] mn015 | the e sort of , Johno and I will take up that"
"[40:31] mn015 | responsibility ,"
"[40:36] mn015 | Now , we have um just , I think two more short things ."
[40:41] me010 | OK .
"[40:43] mn015 | Um ,"
"[40:44] mn015 | y you guys sort of started fighting , uh , on the Bayes - net"
[40:49] me012 | Hmm .
"[40:51] me012 | Yeah , I thought I should , um ,"
"[40:53] me012 | talk a little bit about that , because that might be a good , uh ,"
[40:58] me010 | Good !
[40:59] me010 | OK .
"[41:00] me012 | you know , multiple inputs to a node ."
[41:01] me010 | Good .
[41:02] me010 | And what 's the other one ? so that just we know what the d agenda is ?
"[41:12] me010 | put that off till I I till I understand better ,"
"[41:15] me010 | uh , what he 's doing . It 's just a little embarrassing cause all this was in his thesis and I was on his thesis committee ,"
"[41:21] me010 | and , so , I r really knew this at one time ."
[41:25] me010 | It 's not only uh Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together .
[41:29] me010 | So I 'll dig up some more
[41:31] me010 | stuff from Dekai .
[41:35] me012 | OK . So should I Is there a white board here that I can use ?
[41:42] me012 | Or shall I just use this ?
[41:42] me010 | squealing sound ?
[41:43] me010 | It 's probably just as easy . I
[41:44] mn036 | Yeah .
[41:44] me012 | Yeah .
[41:45] me003 | You can put the microphone in your pocket .
"[41:55] fe004 | It was a quick one , huh ?"
"[41:55] me010 | That 's why they invented "" pocket T 's "" ."
[41:57] fe004 | They have clips ! Huh .
"[41:59] me012 | Yeah . So , um Recall that , uh ,"
[42:04] me012 | we want to have
"[42:16] me012 | the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something , and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude ."
"[42:30] me012 | you know ,"
[42:32] mn015 | E - EVA
"[42:34] me012 | Yeah , E - EVA , right ?"
[42:36] mn015 | Yeah .
"[42:41] me012 | Yeah . Enter ,"
"[42:43] me012 | View ,"
[42:44] me012 | Approach .
[42:44] mn036 | OK . Right .
[42:45] me012 | Right .
[42:51] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[42:55] me012 | This isn't the way it really is , but let me say that , suppose someone mentioned , uh ,"
"[43:03] me012 | Ah , it takes too long . Try let me just say "" Landmark "" ."
"[43:05] me012 | If the thing is a landmark ,"
"[43:14] me012 | if it 's closed or not , at the moment ."
"[43:30] me012 | Right ? That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be . For example , they could be "" time of day "" , in which case we could , uh , say , you know , "" Morning ,"
[43:49] me012 | sort of deal with this .
"[44:00] me012 | Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess ."
[44:18] me012 | Right .
"[44:21] me012 | Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state , which means that this is"
"[44:30] me012 | So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not ,"
"[44:40] me012 | if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ,"
[44:49] mn015 | OK .
[44:51] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:52] me012 | So , the idea is that , um , you have these intermediate nodes , right ? E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?"
"[44:57] me010 | So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ? Good ."
[44:59] me012 | Yeah .
[45:14] me012 | But none of the other sort of cues really apply .
"[45:20] me012 | W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this ,"
[46:01] me012 | so we don't need to specify any probabilities .
"[46:04] me012 | We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ?"
"[46:11] me012 | E - three , E - four ."
[46:13] me012 | Right ?
[46:17] me012 | a majority vote ?
[46:20] me012 | Right ?
[46:28] me010 | W not what the G function is .
[46:34] me010 | There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT . Th - c the full conditional probability table with some function .
"[46:43] me010 | OK ? Which y w you choose appropriately for each case . So , depending on what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate ."
"[46:54] me010 | So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of "" ninety - two "" paper . D and you got one , Robert . I don't know who else has seen it ."
[46:59] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[47:02] me012 | There 's I mean yeah . it 's Heckerman and Breese .
[47:04] me010 | It 's short .
[47:06] me010 | It 's short .
[47:06] me012 | Yeah .
"[47:07] me010 | So , I u w Um , yo uh you Have you read it yet ?"
"[47:10] me012 | Uh , you can Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess ."
"[47:12] me010 | OK , so you should take a look . Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life ."
"[47:14] fe004 | I yeah . I I think so , yeah ."
"[47:16] fe004 | Yeah , @ @ ."
[47:19] mn036 | OK .
"[47:24] me010 | One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is ,"
"[47:26] me010 | "" How much of this does JavaBayes support ? """
[47:36] me010 | Right .
"[47:45] me010 | Right . So the little handout that The little thing that I sent I sent a message saying ,"
"[47:52] me010 | One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function ,"
[47:57] me010 | and use it to build the CPT .
"[48:00] me010 | So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you ,"
[48:01] mn015 | Mmm .
[48:02] me010 | that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be .
"[48:07] me010 | Um and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that ,"
"[48:13] me010 | for ,"
"[48:23] me010 | uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own"
"[48:26] me010 | little table like that , then you could take the ,"
"[48:30] me010 | uh , strength of each of those , times its little table , and you 'd add up the total evidence for "" V "" , "" E "" , and "" A "" ."
[48:38] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:51] me012 | quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs ."
[48:53] me010 | I i i
[49:04] me010 | that does it . It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there .
[49:12] me010 | now is it clear
[49:13] me010 | that you might like to be able to
[49:17] me010 | shortcut
[49:18] me010 | the whole conditional probability table .
"[49:22] mn015 | I mean , in some it seems very plausible in some sense , where we will be likely to not be observe some of the stuff ."
[49:30] mn015 | Cuz we don't have the a access to the information .
"[49:33] me010 | Right . That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ?"
[49:34] mn015 | Yeah .
[49:36] mn015 | So .
[49:37] fe004 | Mmm .
[49:40] me012 | What ?
"[49:40] mn015 | I if it 's a a a discar Discourse Initial Phrase , we will have nothing in the discourse history ."
"[49:48] mn015 | So , if if we ever want to wonder what was mention"
[49:50] me012 | Oh . A are you saying that we 'll not be able to observe certain nodes ? That 's fine . That is sort of orthogonal thing .
"[49:53] me010 | Yeah , so there 's there 's two separate things , Robert ."
[49:55] me010 | The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good
"[49:59] me010 | at saying , "" if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . """
[50:04] me010 | OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at .
"[50:06] me010 | So , if you don't have any information about the discourse ,"
"[50:14] me010 | uh ,"
[50:19] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:23] me010 | and , so forth . So that , they 're good at . But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ?"
[50:27] me010 | And I think that 's the one he was getting at .
[50:28] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[50:28] me012 | Yeah . So , specifically in this case you have to f"
"[50:31] me012 | have this many numbers , whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . Right ? So you have to have just"
[50:36] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[50:37] me012 | three N ?
[50:42] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[50:44] me012 | Yeah . Right .
"[50:44] me010 | Well , pretty quickly ."
"[50:46] fe004 | So , you don't need da data enough to cover uh , nearly as much stuff ."
[50:46] me012 | I don't know .
"[50:51] me003 | "" neural - net - acize "" these Bayes - nets ?"
"[50:53] me010 | Eh well to some No , no . So , "" Noisy - OR "" is a funny"
"[50:57] me010 | way of referring to this , because"
[50:59] me010 | the Noisy - OR is only one instance .
[51:01] me012 | Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore .
[51:05] me003 | Yeah .
[51:05] me010 | of a way t t
"[51:26] me010 | uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that ."
"[51:30] me010 | uh , like the Noisy - OR function ,"
"[51:33] me010 | really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max ."
"[51:37] me012 | Well , the "" OR "" ."
[51:39] me010 | Same .
[51:39] me012 | Right . I guess you 're right . Yeah .
"[51:47] me010 | And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people"
[52:04] me010 | I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that .
[52:10] mn015 | Wha - still sort of leaves one question .
"[52:26] mn015 | of getting these point four , point five , point one ,"
"[52:30] mn015 | of C - four ,"
"[52:38] mn015 | and if it 's a garden ,"
[52:57] me012 | It 'll be students Where else would it be stored ? That 's the question .
[52:57] mn015 | let 's see .
"[52:59] mn015 | Well , in the beginning , we 'll write up a flat file . We know we have twenty object types and we 'll write it down in a flat file ."
[53:01] me010 | Oh .
[53:02] me010 | Yeah .
"[53:03] me010 | No . So , i is"
"[53:04] me010 | Well , let me say something , guys , cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now ."
[53:07] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[53:09] me010 | The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology
"[53:25] me010 | If you don't , you look up the hierarchy ,"
"[53:28] me010 | Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of ,"
"[53:32] me010 | um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode . Let 's OK , so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks . If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there ."
"[53:41] me010 | If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one ."
[53:45] me012 | OK .
"[53:46] me012 | So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ?"
[53:48] me010 | Absolutely .
[53:48] me012 | OK .
"[53:57] me010 | a an object , is its EVA vector ."
[54:00] me012 | OK . Mm - hmm .
"[54:01] me010 | And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there . This is part of what Dekai was doing ."
"[54:06] me010 | So , when we get to Wu ,"
[54:07] me012 | Right .
[54:08] me010 | The - e We 'll see w what he says about that .
"[54:12] me010 | If it isn't there , it 's higher , and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior ."
"[54:21] me010 | uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level , which might be equal , or whatever it is ."
[54:24] me012 | Right .
[54:27] me012 | Yeah .
[54:32] me010 | these local vectors and the ontology .
"[54:35] me010 | And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless"
[54:38] me010 | we find a reason to do something different .
[54:41] me012 | Yeah .
[54:42] me010 | Does this make sense to you ? Bhask - ?
[54:43] me012 | Yeah .
"[54:44] me012 | So , we are but we we 're not doing the ontology , so we have to get to whoever is doing the u ultimately ,"
"[54:48] me010 | Indeed . So , that 's another thing we 're gonna need to do , is is , to ,"
"[55:11] me003 | Yeah , hash on object name to , you know , uh , the probabilities or whatever ."
[55:12] me010 | th
[55:13] me010 | Yeah .
[55:15] me010 | e
"[55:15] me010 | Right . And , so ,"
"[55:17] mn015 | But it 's , uh Well , it strikes me as a What For -"
"[55:21] mn015 | If we get the mechanism ,"
[55:38] mn015 | two to three days because they 're having really trouble getting the upper level
"[55:42] mn015 | straight , and"
"[55:45] mn015 | given the craw bet uh , the the the projects"
[56:04] me010 | Right . Yeah .
"[56:15] mn015 | And , um ,"
"[56:18] mn015 | what I don't think is ever going to be in the ontology , is sort of , you know , the likelihood of , eh , people entering r"
"[56:41] me010 | Well , they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances ? I mean , you y"
[56:56] me010 | OK .
[57:01] mn015 | we now have to hook it up to instances .
[57:03] mn015 | I mean this is
[57:05] me010 | But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ?
"[57:12] mn015 | Yeah , but the ontology is really not a SmartKom"
"[57:16] mn015 | thing ,"
[57:20] mn015 | I kicked loose
[57:21] mn015 | in in EML . So it 's a completely EML
"[57:28] mn015 | Yes , u a w a lot of people are aware of that ."
"[57:39] mn015 | No , but th the r eh I th I still think that"
"[57:44] mn015 | For example , whether OK . So , th it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world ."
[57:50] mn015 | Let 's assume there are only twenty object types in this world .
[57:53] mn015 | And it will know if any of those have institutional meanings .
[58:05] mn015 | enterable .
[58:06] mn015 | Right ? In a sense . You know .
[58:08] mn015 | Yep .
[58:10] mn015 | Yep .
"[58:11] me010 | Conceptually , we know what should be done ."
[58:18] me010 | is to build a a separate thing that that
[58:21] me010 | just pools i i
"[58:22] me010 | Like , i i it it may be ,"
"[58:24] me010 | that ,"
[58:25] me010 | the the instance w That we have to build our own
"[58:28] me010 | instance , uh ,"
"[58:29] me010 | things , that ,"
"[58:30] me010 | with their types , and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type . So we build a little data structure And so what we would do in that case ,"
"[58:36] me010 | is , in our instance gadget have"
"[58:49] me010 | uh , EVA tree ."
[58:51] me012 | Yeah . Right .
"[58:51] me010 | And then , for other ,"
[58:59] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[59:00] me010 | and then would hash or whatever we do to say , "" ah ! If it 's that type of thing ,"
"[59:06] me010 | it 's that . """
"[59:07] me010 | So , I I think we can handle that . And then But , the combination functions ,"
"[59:12] me010 | and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff ,"
"[59:15] me010 | is , uh is the bigger deal ."
[59:18] me012 | Yeah .
[59:18] me010 | I think that 's where we have to get technically clever .
[59:22] me003 | We could just steal the classes in JavaBayes and then
[59:25] me003 | interface to them with our own code .
"[59:28] me012 | That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess ."
"[59:30] me010 | Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute ."
[59:35] me010 | Just ?
"[59:42] me010 | But , yeah , we could look at it ."
[59:45] me010 | Yeah .
"[00:00] me003 | Well , no , but that just means there 's a protocol ,"
"[00:03] me010 | It may or may not . I don't know . That 's the question is "" to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? """
[00:10] me010 | And I don't know .
"[00:13] me003 | So you could have four different Bayes - nets that you 're running , and then run your own write your own function that would take the output of those four ,"
"[00:20] me003 | and make your own "" G function "" , is what I was saying ."
"[00:21] me010 | Yeah , that 's fine if it 's if it comes only at the end . But suppose you want it embedded ?"
[00:32] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:33] me010 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet ."
"[00:34] me010 | But , at that point you may say , "" hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town . Let 's see if there 's"
"[00:39] me010 | another package that 's , eh , more civilized about this . """
"[00:45] me010 | Now , Srini"
"[00:46] me010 | is worth talking to on this ,"
[00:48] me010 | cuz he
[00:49] me010 | said that he actually did
[00:52] me010 | hack some combining functions into JavaBayes.
[00:54] me012 | Ah !
"[00:58] me010 | whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work ."
[01:03] me010 | Uh . But he did do it .
"[01:06] me012 | I don't see why the , uh , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into JavaBayes. I mean , they 're used to create tables so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML ."
"[01:14] me010 | Well , I say that 's one way to do it , is is to just convert it"
[01:23] me010 | it doesn't require any
[01:24] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[01:25] me010 | data fitting or complication .
[01:26] me012 | Yeah .
"[01:31] me012 | I mean , OK . So say it blows up , right ? So there 's , like ,"
[01:34] me012 | the
"[01:38] me012 | that , which isn't so bad ."
[01:41] me010 | I I understand . I 'm just saying tha that w
[01:42] me010 | That was wi that was my note .
[01:44] me010 | The little note I sent said that .
[01:46] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:46] me010 | It said , "" Here 's the way you 'd take"
"[01:48] me010 | the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . """
[01:51] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[01:52] me010 | I mean that the Max - the Evidence - Combining function .
[01:55] me010 | So we could do that . And maybe that 's what we 'll do .
[02:02] me010 | don't know .
[02:12] me010 | and try to understand it .
"[02:14] me010 | Uh , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give"
[02:18] me012 | p Sure .
"[02:19] mn036 | Yeah , I I would like a copy , y y yeah ."
[02:19] me010 | to people ?
[02:20] me012 | OK .
[02:21] me010 | OK .
"[02:41] mn015 | Yeah , uh - huh ."
[02:45] mn015 | OK .
[02:51] me010 | coming in
[02:57] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[03:10] me012 | Yep .
[03:11] fe004 | Sure .

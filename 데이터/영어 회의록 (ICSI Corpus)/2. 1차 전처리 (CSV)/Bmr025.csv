[00:00] me022 | Yeah .
"[00:01] me013 | Um , so ."
[00:13] me013 | Um .
[00:17] me013 | So .
"[00:19] me013 | Agenda is according to this , is transcription status , DARPA demos"
"[00:22] me013 | XML tools , disks , backups , et cetera"
[00:29] me011 | Does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ?
[00:33] me013 | OK .
[00:35] me013 | Should we just go in order ? Transcription status ? Who 's that 's probably you .
[00:41] me013 | Seven ?
[00:43] me013 | Oh .
"[00:47] fe008 | and uh ,"
[00:49] fe008 | uh I 've been uh finishing up the uh double checking .
[00:53] fe008 | I hoped to have had that done by today but it 's gonna take one more week .
[00:57] me011 | Um
"[00:58] me011 | as a somewhat segue into the next topic , um"
[00:58] mn014 | I g
[01:01] me011 | could I get a hold of uh
[01:04] me011 | the data even if it 's not really corrected yet just so I can get the data formats
[01:08] me011 | and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working ?
"[01:11] fe008 | Certainly . Yeah I mean , it 's in the same place it 's been ."
"[01:12] me011 | Oh , it is . OK . Just So , "" transcripts """
[01:13] fe008 | Uh - huh . No change .
[01:15] me011 | is the sub - directory ?
[01:16] fe008 | Yes . Uh - huh .
[01:17] me011 | OK .
[01:17] me011 | So I 'll I 'll probably just make some copies of those rather than use the ones that are there .
[01:23] fe008 | OK .
[01:23] me011 | Um and then
[01:24] me011 | just we 'll have to remember to
[01:26] me011 | delete them once the corrections are made .
[01:30] fe008 | OK .
"[01:32] me013 | OK , wh"
[01:32] mn014 | I also got anot a short remark to the transcription . I 've uh just processed the first five EDU meetings and they are chunked up so they would they probably can be sent to IBM
[01:44] mn014 | whenever they want them .
[01:45] me018 | Well the second one of those
[01:46] me001 | Cool .
"[01:47] mn014 | Yep . It 's already at IBM , but the other ones Yeah ."
[01:47] me018 | is already at IBM .
[01:49] me018 | That 's the one that we 're waiting to hear from them on .
[01:51] mn014 | Yeah .
[01:51] me018 | Yeah .
[01:51] fe008 | OK .
[01:54] me018 | They 're the IBM set .
[01:55] mn014 | Yep .
[01:56] fe008 | Excellent . Good .
[01:56] me018 | Yeah .
[01:57] me018 | And so as soon as we hear
[01:59] me018 | from Brian
[02:00] me018 | that
[02:01] me018 | this one is OK and we get the transcript back and we find out that
[02:04] me018 | hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript
[02:07] me018 | with what we gave
"[02:09] me018 | them ,"
"[02:10] me018 | then uh we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as a big batch ,"
[02:14] fe008 | Excellent .
[02:14] me018 | and let them work on that .
[02:16] me011 | And so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ?
"[02:19] me018 | Yes , exactly . We 're sort of doing things in parallel , that way we can get as much done a at once . Yeah ."
"[02:19] me011 | OK , good ."
"[02:22] me011 | Yeah , I think that 's the right way to do it , especially for the information retrieval stuff ."
[02:28] me011 | Anything else on transcription status ?
[02:31] me011 | OK .
"[02:32] me013 | DARPA demos , we had the submeeting the other day ."
[02:36] me011 | So I 've been working on using the THISL tools to do information retrieval on meeting data
"[02:43] me011 | there 're two sets , there 's a back - end and a front - end , so the front - end is the user interface and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool ."
[02:51] me011 | And so I 've written some tools to convert everything into the right for file formats .
[02:56] me011 | And the
[02:58] me011 | command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working .
[03:02] me011 | So at least on the one meeting that I had the transcript for
"[03:05] me011 | uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it , do type in a a string and get back a list of start - end times for the meeting ,"
[03:13] me011 | uh of hits .
"[03:13] me018 | What what kind of uh what does that look like ? The string that you type in . What are you are you are they keywords , or are they ? OK ."
[03:17] me011 | Keywords .
[03:19] me018 | I see .
[03:19] me011 | Right ? And so and then it munges it to pass it to the THISL IR which uses an SGML - like
[03:25] me011 | format for everything .
[03:26] me018 | I see .
[03:27] me013 | And then
[03:28] me013 | does it play something back or that 's something you 're having to program ?
"[03:29] me011 | Um , right now , I have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools ,"
[03:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[03:39] me011 | So so that 's the other thing I wanted to discuss , is well what should we do for the user interface ? We have"
"[03:44] me011 | two tools that have already been written . Um the SoftSound guys did a web - based one ,"
[03:48] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:49] me011 | um , which I haven't used , haven't looked at . Dan says it 's pretty good"
[03:52] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[03:53] me011 | but it does mean you need to be running a web server .
[03:56] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[03:56] me011 | And so it it 's pretty big and complex .
[03:59] me011 | Uh and it would be difficult to port to Windows because it means porting the web server to Windows .
[04:04] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[04:04] me011 | Uh the other option is Dan did the Tcl - TK THISL GUI front - end
[04:09] me013 | Yeah .
[04:09] me011 | for Broadcast News which I think looks great . I think that 's a nice demo .
[04:13] me011 | Um and that would be much easier to port to Windows .
[04:16] me011 | And so I think that 's the way we should go .
[04:18] fe008 | I Can I ask a question ? So um
[04:19] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:21] fe008 | as it stands within the the Channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do a find and a play ."
"[04:26] fe008 | You can find a searched string and play . So e Are you So you 're adding like um ,"
"[04:33] me011 | It 's a sort of standard ,"
"[04:37] me011 | So it 's uh term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring ."
[04:41] fe008 | OK .
[04:41] me011 | Um
[04:42] me011 | and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing how far apart they have to be and things like that .
[04:47] me011 | So it it 's
[04:48] fe008 | It 's a lot more sophisticated than the uh
[04:49] me011 | i
[04:50] me011 | it 's like doing a Google query or anyth anything else like that .
[04:54] me011 | So i it uses So it pr produces an index ahead of time so you don't you 're not doing a linear search through all the documents .
[04:54] fe008 | OK .
[05:00] me011 | Cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do a search .
[05:05] me011 | Um you have to do preindexing and so that these tools do all that .
[05:05] fe008 | Good .
"[05:13] me011 | uh to get it to work on the UNIX systems , our side is just"
[05:17] me011 | rewriting them and modifying them
[05:19] me011 | to work for meetings . So that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just
[05:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[05:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[05:26] me011 | sorta things like that .
[05:27] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[05:28] me018 | So what does the user see as the result of the query ?
[05:31] me011 | On which tool ?
[05:32] me018 | THISL .
"[05:34] me011 | The THISL GUI tool which is the one that Dan wrote , Tcl - TK"
[05:35] me018 | Yeah .
[05:37] me011 | um you type in a query and then you get back a list
[05:41] me011 | of hits
[05:42] me011 | and you can type on them and listen to them .
[05:44] me011 | Click on them rather with a mouse .
[05:45] me018 | Ah .
"[05:46] me018 | So if you typed in "" small heads "" or something you could"
[05:46] me013 | Mmm
[05:51] me018 | something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred or some
[06:00] fe016 | Guess who I practice on ?
[06:06] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:11] me013 | Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable . Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable"
[06:12] me011 | Right .
[06:16] me013 | uh demo sort of format .
[06:16] me018 | Yeah that sounds good . That sounds really neat .
[06:16] me011 | And so I think
"[06:17] me011 | there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff ."
[06:24] me011 | Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I 'll work with him on it .
"[06:29] me011 | And it it 's looking pretty good , you know , the fact that I got the query system working ."
[06:33] me011 | So if we wanna just do a video - based one I think that 'll be easy .
[06:36] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:36] me011 | If we wanna get it to Windows it 's gonna be a little more work because the
[06:40] me011 | THISL
"[06:42] me011 | IR , the information retrieval tool 's um , I had difficulty just compiling them on Solaris ."
[06:47] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:47] me011 | So getting them to compile on
[06:49] me011 | Windows might be challenging .
[06:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:51] me011 | So .
"[06:56] me011 | It certainly helps . Um , I mean without those I wouldn't even attempt it ."
[06:58] me018 | Uh - huh .
[07:00] me018 | Yeah .
[07:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:01] me011 | But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer ,"
[07:05] me011 | so that the normal UNIX function calls all work .
[07:06] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[07:07] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:08] me011 | Um ,"
[07:09] me018 | And you have to have all the o
[07:09] me011 | But the problem is that that the THISL tools didn't use anything like Autoconf
[07:14] me011 | and so you have the normal porting problems of
[07:17] me011 | different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't
[07:21] me011 | and uh
[07:22] me011 | different compiler work - arounds and so on . So the fact that
[07:26] me011 | um it took me a day to get it c to compile under Solaris means it 's probably gonna take me
[07:30] me011 | s significantly more than that to get it to compile under Windows .
[07:33] me013 | How about having it run under free BSD ?
[07:36] me011 | Free BSD would probably be easier .
[07:37] me022 | All you need to do is say to Dan
"[07:39] me022 | "" gee it would be nice if this worked under Autoconf "" and it 'll be done in a day ."
[07:45] me011 | Actually you know I should check because he did port it to SPRACHcore
[07:49] me022 | Right .
[07:49] me011 | so he might have done that already .
[07:50] me022 | I I I wouldn't be surprised .
[07:53] me018 | How does it play ?
"[07:54] me013 | But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it ."
[08:02] me011 | Right .
"[08:10] me011 | So , and I 've been corresponding with Dan and also with uh"
[08:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[08:14] me011 | uh ,"
[08:18] me011 | Blanking on his name .
[08:19] me018 | Tony Robinson ?
[08:20] me013 | Tony Robinson ?
[08:20] me011 | Do I mean Tony ? I guess I do .
[08:22] me013 | Yeah .
[08:22] me011 | Or S or Steve Renals .
[08:22] me022 | James Christie .
[08:24] me011 | Which one do I mean ?
[08:24] me013 | Steve Renal - Steve Renals .
"[08:24] me022 | Steve Renals is not SoftSound , is he ?"
[08:26] me013 | No .
"[08:27] me011 | My brain is not working , I don't remember who I 've been corresponding with ."
[08:28] me013 | OK .
[08:29] me022 | Steve wro i it 's Ste - Steve Renals wrote
[08:32] me022 | THISL IR .
[08:32] me011 | Then it 's Steve Renals .
[08:34] me022 | OK .
"[08:34] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[08:34] me011 | So uh just getting documentation and uh and f and formats , so that 's all going pretty well , I think we 'll be OK with that ."
[08:36] me013 | Yeah .
[08:39] me022 | Right .
[08:39] me018 | What about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ?
[08:43] me011 | Um
"[08:46] me011 | Well , that 's a good point too ."
[08:47] me022 | Here 's a here 's a crazy idea actually .
[08:48] me011 | I don't know .
[08:50] me022 | Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ?
[08:55] me022 | They 're both Tcl interfaces .
[09:00] me011 | Having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing
[09:03] me011 | because he 's worked on the Transcriber stuff
[09:05] me022 | Right .
[09:06] me011 | and he 's more familiar with Tcl - TK than I am .
[09:06] me022 | And then you get they then you get the Windows media playing for free .
"[09:10] me011 | Well that 's Snack , not not Transcriber ."
"[09:18] me011 | Yeah , yeah , I mean , I I think THISL THISL GUI probably uses Snack ."
[09:24] me011 | And so my intention was just to base it on that .
[09:29] me022 | Yeah .
[09:29] me022 | Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts
"[09:34] me022 | um eh you know , from speaker to speaker ."
"[09:36] me022 | Right ? Do you have you have , you know , a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ?"
"[09:40] me011 | Right , we 'll have to figure out a user interface for that , so ."
[09:42] me022 | Right .
[09:43] me022 | Well that eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever
[09:46] me022 | do it .
[09:46] me022 | Or whatever .
[09:52] me011 | the little short segments we 'd be talking about and having
[09:57] me022 | Yeah .
"[09:59] me013 | The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to"
[10:03] me013 | get PowerPoint shows
"[10:09] me011 | Yeah , I mean we have to I have to sit down and try it before I make too many judgments , so uh"
[10:13] me013 | Yeah .
[10:15] me011 | Um
[10:16] me011 | My experience with the Gnu compatibility library is really
[10:20] me011 | it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system .
[10:24] me011 | Right ? The Windows system isn't any harder because it it looks like a BSD system .
[10:27] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:28] me011 | It 's just , you know , just like all of them , the "" include "" files are a little different and the function calls are a little different ."
[10:32] me013 | Right .
[10:33] me011 | So I it might be a little easier but it 's not gonna be a lot easier .
[10:37] me013 | OK .
"[10:38] me013 | So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones , then we talked about"
[10:42] me013 | um some other stuff which would basically be
"[10:45] me013 | um showing off the the Transcriber interface itself and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense , but but um ,"
[10:53] me013 | uh and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like .
[10:59] mn014 | Yeah .
[11:01] fe008 | Can I ask one more thing about THISL ?
[11:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[11:07] fe008 | Excellent . Excellent .
[11:08] fe008 | Yeah .
[11:09] fe016 | So another idea I w t had
[11:11] fe016 | just now actually for the demo was
[11:17] fe016 | work that Don 's been doing .
[11:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[11:20] fe016 | Um actually show some of the features and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries .
"[11:29] fe016 | Um ,"
"[11:30] fe016 | you know , you can show that graphically , sort of what the features are doing . It , you know , it doesn't work great but it 's definitely giving us something ."
[11:36] fe016 | I don't know if that would be of interest or not .
[11:38] me013 | at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically
[11:42] fe016 | Yeah .
[11:46] me013 | it 's much better than me just having a bullet point
"[11:49] me013 | pointing at something I don't know much about , so ."
"[11:49] fe016 | I mean , you 're looking at this now Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ?"
[11:52] me001 | Um yeah I 'm starting to and
[11:57] me001 | Yeah we can probably find some examples
[11:59] me001 | of different type of prosodic
[12:00] fe016 | Yeah def
[12:02] me001 | events going on .
"[12:02] me013 | S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month"
[12:03] fe016 | I
[12:10] me013 | and then that 'll give us a week or so .
[12:12] me011 | This month .
"[12:12] fe016 | Oh , you mean like today ?"
[12:14] fe016 | Oh .
[12:15] me013 | June . June . June .
[12:15] me001 | Yeah .
[12:17] me018 | There 's another one .
[12:18] me022 | Exactly .
"[12:21] me013 | that 'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works , yeah ."
"[12:26] me001 | Yeah , I mean I 'll be here ."
[12:31] me013 | Yeah .
[12:35] me013 | Yeah .
[12:38] fe016 | it could potentially be in it .
[12:41] fe016 | Could find some .
"[12:41] me013 | Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers so I mean , you know ,"
[12:44] fe016 | I mean it 's different .
[12:49] me013 | Yeah .
[12:51] me013 | Good .
[12:53] me013 | Done with that .
[12:55] me013 | XML tools ?
[12:56] me011 | Um .
[12:57] me011 | So I 've been doing a bunch of XML tools where you we 're sort of moving to XML as the
[13:02] me011 | general format for everything and I think that 's definitely the right way to go because there are a lot of tools
[13:07] me011 | that let you do extraction and reformatting of XML tools .
[13:10] me011 | Um .
[13:12] me011 | So yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in XML because I 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .
[13:23] me011 | uh because it doesn't mark start and end .
[13:26] mn014 | Yeah .
[13:27] me011 | Utterance .
[13:29] me011 | So it 's implicit in in there but you have to do a lot of processing to get it .
[13:30] me018 | Yeah .
[13:31] me018 | Right . Right .
[13:32] me011 | And so and also I 'd like to do the indirect time line business .
"[13:36] me011 | Um but regardless , I mean , w that 's something that you , me , and Jane can talk about later . Um ,"
"[13:48] me011 | extracting any information from any of these files , either uh information on"
[13:55] me011 | I 'm converting the Key files to XML so that you can extract m uh
[13:59] me001 | Cool .
[13:59] me011 | various inf uh sorted information on individual meetings
[14:00] mn014 | Yeah .
[14:03] me011 | and then also the transcripts . And so l just let me know there it 's mostly Java and Perl
[14:07] me011 | but we can get other languages too if if that 's desirable .
"[14:10] fe016 | Oh , quick question on that . Is do we have the the seat information ?"
[14:15] fe016 | In in the Key files now ?
[14:16] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[14:16] me011 | The seat information is on the Key files for the ones which
[14:17] fe008 | Ah .
"[14:20] me011 | it 's been recorded , yeah ."
[14:20] fe016 | For the new one OK . Great .
[14:21] me013 | Seat ?
[14:22] fe016 | Sea - yeah .
[14:23] me011 | Where where you 're sitting .
[14:24] me013 | Oh ! Not not the quality or anything . No . OK . I see .
[14:29] me013 | Yeah .
[14:30] me013 | OK .
"[14:30] me011 | Oh , but that might just be me ."
[14:30] fe016 | OK .
[14:33] fe016 | Alright .
[14:34] me013 | That 's more seat information than we wanted .
[14:34] fe016 | Never mind .
"[14:36] fe016 | I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ?"
[14:37] me013 | Yeah .
"[14:39] me013 | Mmm , yeah ."
"[14:41] me018 | Wait a minute , how how w eh where is it in the Key file ?"
[14:41] me011 | Right .
[14:41] me013 | Yeah .
[14:44] me011 | The square bracket .
[14:45] fe016 | Cuz
[14:48] me011 | You haven't been putting it in .
[14:49] fe008 | Well bu
"[14:50] me011 | Oh , OK ."
[14:50] fe008 | Isn't it always on the digits ?
[14:50] me013 | Some of these are missing . Aren't they ?
[14:52] fe008 | Isn't it always on the digits forms ?
[14:53] fe016 | Well it
[14:53] me011 | Yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have .
[14:54] me001 | Ooo .
[15:00] me018 | I never knew we were supposed to put it in the Key file .
[15:03] me018 | Oh really ?
[15:04] me011 | I mean this is why I wanna use a g a tool to do it rather than the plain text because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things .
[15:06] fe016 | OK .
[15:09] me018 | OK .
[15:12] me011 | So .
"[15:13] me011 | Um if you use the Edit - key ,"
[15:17] mn014 | Edit - key .
[15:18] me011 | Did I show you guys that ?
[15:19] mn014 | Yep .
"[15:19] me011 | I did show it to you , but I think you both said "" no , you 'll just use"
"[15:20] me018 | You mentioned it , yeah . Yeah ."
"[15:23] me011 | text file "" . Um it has it in there , a place to fill it in ."
[15:26] fe016 | OK .
[15:27] me018 | OK .
[15:34] me011 | Yep .
[15:36] me001 | u
[15:42] fe016 | Yeah .
[15:43] fe016 | Right .
"[15:46] fe016 | I don't , maybe I forgot to d"
[15:46] me018 | Oh ! OK . I didn't do that either .
[15:47] mn014 | Yeah .
[15:50] me018 | Takes me no time at all to edit these .
[15:51] fe016 | Yeah .
[15:52] me018 | I 'm not doing anything .
"[16:00] me013 | Ah , OK ."
[16:07] me011 | And so that 's also a problem .
[16:10] me011 | So anyway .
[16:12] fe016 | We will do better .
[16:12] me011 | That 's it .
[16:20] me011 | that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected .
[16:23] me011 | And it 's not quite ready to go yet because um
[16:26] me011 | it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not because
[16:32] me011 | are about the same level if they 're off
[16:34] me011 | and no one 's o off or if they 're on and no one 's talking .
[16:36] me001 | Huh .
"[16:37] me011 | Um these these ones , they"
"[16:39] me011 | are much easier , there 's a bigger difference ."
[16:42] me011 | So I 'm working on that and it it sorta works and so eventually we will change to that and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out .
[16:49] me001 | Will that also include like batteries dying ?
[16:51] me011 | Yep .
[16:52] me001 | Just a any time the mike 's putting out zeros basically .
[16:53] me011 | Yep .
[16:54] me011 | Yep .
[16:55] mn014 | But y yeah .
[16:56] me011 | Well I 'll turn off the screensaver too .
[16:57] me001 | Yeah .
[16:57] mn014 | Yeah .
[16:58] me001 | Oops . Speaking of which .
"[16:59] me011 | Um the other thing is as I 've said before , it is actually on"
[17:03] me011 | the thing . There 's a little level meter
[17:04] me011 | but of course no one ever pays attention to it . So I think having it on the screen
[17:09] me011 | is more easy to notice .
[17:17] me013 | Small shocks
[17:21] me013 | OK .
"[17:22] me011 | OK , disk backup , et cetera ?"
[17:24] me011 | Um I spoke with Dave Johnson about putting all the Meeting Recorder stuff on non - backed - up disk to save the overhead of backup
"[17:31] me011 | and he pretty much said "" yeah , you could do that if you want """
[17:34] me011 | but he thought it was a bad idea .
[17:36] me011 | In fact what he said is
[17:43] me011 | and we should do that and have it backed up .
[17:46] me011 | He w he 's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup .
"[17:50] me011 | I mean , his point was well taken . This data cannot be recovered ."
[17:53] fe016 | Yeah .
[17:54] me011 | And so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup
[17:58] me011 | we should have the archive and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup .
[18:02] me013 | Well I guess it is true that even with something that 's backed up it 's
[18:08] me013 | if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups .
[18:12] me011 | Just just the monthly full .
[18:13] fe008 | Hmm .
[18:16] me011 | Yeah . But he said
[18:20] me011 | that we sh
"[18:20] me011 | shouldn't worry too much about that ,"
[18:22] me011 | that we 're getting a new backup system and we 're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it 's w
[18:26] me013 | Really ?
[18:27] me011 | probably OK .
"[18:28] me011 | And uh , so the only issue here is the timing between"
[18:34] me011 | getting more disks and
[18:37] me011 | uh
[18:38] me011 | recording meetings .
[18:40] me013 | So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the
[18:43] me013 | non - backed - up space for things
"[18:45] me013 | that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that , right ?"
"[18:49] me011 | Things that are recreatable easily and also Yeah , basically things that are recreatable ."
[18:50] me013 | Yeah .
[18:52] me013 | Yeah .
[18:54] me011 | The expanded files and things like that .
[18:57] me013 | OK .
[18:57] me011 | They take up a lot more room anyway .
[18:59] me013 | Yeah .
[19:00] me011 | Uh but we do need more disk .
[19:02] me013 | So we can get more disk . Yeah . So .
[19:03] me011 | Yeah .
[19:05] me011 | And I I think I agree with him . I mean his point was well taken that
[19:08] me011 | if we lose one of these we cannot get it back .
[19:10] me013 | OK .
[19:14] me011 | I don't think there was any other et cetera there .
[19:23] me022 | I thought you guys were gonna burn C Ds ?
[19:25] me011 | Um unfortunately we could burn C Ds but first of all it 's a pain .
[19:28] me022 | Yeah .
[19:28] me011 | Because you have to copy it down to the PC and then
[19:31] me011 | burn it and that 's a multi - step procedure .
[19:39] me022 | Yeah .
[19:39] me011 | So I think burning them for distribution is fine
[19:42] me011 | but burning them for backup is not a good idea .
[19:44] me022 | I see .
[19:45] me011 | Cuz th they they
[19:45] me022 | OK .
[19:47] me011 | fail after a couple years .
[19:48] me022 | Alright .
[19:51] fe008 | I do have uh uh It 's a different topic . Can I add one top topic ? We have time ?
"[19:54] fe008 | I wanted to ask , I know that uh that Thilo you were , um ,"
[19:58] fe008 | bringing the Channeltrans interface onto the Windows machine ?
"[20:02] mn014 | Yeah it 's it Basically it 's done , yeah ."
[20:02] fe008 | And I wanted to know is th
[20:04] fe008 | It 's all done ? That 's g wonderful . Great .
[20:05] mn014 | Yeah .
"[20:06] me011 | Yes , since Tcl - TK runs on it , basically"
[20:09] me011 | things 'll just work .
"[20:10] mn014 | Yeah , it was just a problem with the Snack version and the Transcriber version but"
[20:14] mn014 | it 's solved . So .
"[20:25] mn014 | Yeah , basically uh I"
[20:26] mn014 | did install it on my laptop and yeah
[20:29] fe008 | Wonderful .
[20:29] mn014 | it worked .
[20:30] fe008 | Wonderful .
[20:30] me013 | Hmm !
[20:31] me013 | Good .
[20:33] me013 | CrossPads ?
[20:34] me011 | Uh got an email from uh
"[20:37] me011 | James Landay who basically said "" if you 're not using them ,"
"[20:41] me011 | could you return them ? """
"[20:42] me011 | So he said he doesn't need them , he just"
[20:44] me011 | periodically w at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them
[20:49] me011 | and asks them if they 're still using them .
[20:51] me013 | So we 've never used them .
[20:52] fe008 | We used them once .
[20:53] me013 | Once ?
[20:54] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[20:54] me018 | Them ? There 's more than one ?
[20:54] fe008 | Couple times .
"[20:55] me011 | Yeah , we have two ."
[20:56] fe008 | Yeah .
[20:56] me013 | i
[20:57] me011 | Um .
"[20:59] me011 | My opinion on it is , first , I never take notes anyway"
"[21:02] me011 | so I 'm not gonna use it ,"
"[21:04] me011 | um and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with ."
"[21:09] fe008 | And I have uh so my my feeling on it is that I think in principle it 's a really nice idea , and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes . On the other hand ,"
[21:20] fe008 | I the down side for me was that
[21:22] fe008 | I think the pen is really noisy .
[21:37] fe008 | I don't know .
"[21:38] mn014 | Uh , what is a CrossPad ?"
"[21:40] me013 | So it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen"
[21:46] me013 | which indicates position .
[21:48] me013 | And so you have time and position
[21:48] mn014 | OK .
[21:51] me013 | stuff stored so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written .
[21:55] mn014 | OK .
[21:56] me011 | And then you can download it and they have OCR and searching and all sorts of things .
[21:59] mn014 | OK .
[22:00] mn014 | OK .
[22:01] me011 | So i if you take notes it 's a great little device .
[22:01] fe008 | Could Mm - hmm .
"[22:04] me011 | But I don't take notes , so ."
"[22:06] me013 | And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things , not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and"
[22:16] me013 | so forth and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting
"[22:22] me013 | you know , where would it come from ? And um I think that was one of the"
[22:24] mn014 | Yeah .
[22:26] me011 | Yep .
[22:27] fe016 | Yeah .
"[22:27] me013 | things , right ? And so the it seemed like a neat idea . We 'll have a you know , have a scribe ,"
[22:31] me013 | have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting .
"[22:37] me011 | Yep , and then just sort of died out ."
[22:42] me011 | Yep .
[22:42] me013 | Yeah .
[22:43] fe008 | u
[22:43] fe008 | but I guess the the other
[22:45] fe008 | thing I 'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing I wonder if we 'd
"[22:48] fe008 | lose that much by having someone be a scribe by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards and"
[22:54] fe008 | taking notes in some other interface .
"[22:56] me018 | I mean we 're transcribing it anyways , why do we need notes ?"
[22:59] me011 | Because that 's summary .
[23:00] me013 | Summary .
[23:03] me018 | Summarize it from the transcription .
"[23:05] fe016 | Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X and you don't wanna take notes and you 're you just wanna"
[23:19] fe016 | in in other words you can use that just to highlight times
[23:23] fe016 | in a very simple way . Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this but
[23:36] fe016 | they could just sort of
[23:38] fe016 | make an X near that point or a question mark that
[23:41] fe016 | sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c
[23:44] fe016 | could get some red flags in that transcript region and they can then look at it . So .
[23:48] fe016 | I know we haven't been using it but
[23:50] fe016 | I w
[23:51] fe016 | I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods which you then
[23:54] me011 | Right .
[23:56] fe016 | get back in a transcript so .
[23:56] fe008 | Well .
"[24:06] me013 | and put some kind of summary or something uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe"
"[24:11] me013 | who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing ,"
"[24:15] me013 | not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important ."
[24:19] me013 | then you don't you don't have
[24:21] me013 | the time reference
[24:22] fe016 | Right .
[24:23] me013 | uh that you 'd have if you had it live .
"[24:25] fe016 | And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful , so ."
[24:27] me013 | Yeah .
[24:28] me018 | How do you synchronize the time in the CrossPad and the time of the recording ?
[24:30] me011 | I mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally and that that 's w
[24:38] fe016 | Uh .
[24:40] me011 | You know you want it pretty close and there 's a fair amount of skew because it 's a hand - held unit with a battery
[24:40] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[24:46] fe008 | Well when when I d
[24:47] fe008 | OK .
"[24:47] me011 | so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used ,"
[24:53] me011 | so that it 's synchronized with the time on that and then you have to
"[24:56] me011 | download to an application , and then you have to"
[24:59] me011 | figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information .
[25:04] me011 | And so there 's a lot of infrastructure which
"[25:08] fe008 | There is an alternative , I mean , it 's still , there 's uh you know , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure , but"
[25:13] fe008 | it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it . You c
[25:21] me011 | Hmm .
"[25:24] me011 | Well , but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end which someone has to listen to that and find that point ,"
[25:25] me022 | Right .
"[25:28] fe008 | Yeah , it 's transcribed . It 's in the transcript ."
[25:29] me011 | and then mark it .
[25:30] me011 | So .
[25:30] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:32] fe008 | Well it 's in the transcript .
"[25:32] fe016 | Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ? Would h I mean is there a big cau"
[25:39] fe016 | even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate
[25:48] fe016 | it might not be the case that we can actually
[25:50] fe016 | synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure but we could at least try it out .
[25:54] me013 | one thing that we might try
[25:58] me013 | um
"[25:59] me013 | is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else ,"
"[26:05] me013 | we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task . I mean ,"
[26:10] fe016 | Right .
[26:20] me013 | and so forth so and and Jane is more into it but eh uh
[26:28] me013 | to get someone to actually buy into it and have at least some series of meetings where we do it .
"[26:34] me013 | and if so , it 's probably worth having one ."
"[26:36] me013 | The p the the problem with the the more extended view , all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular"
[26:42] me013 | applications of it is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to
[26:46] me013 | um
"[26:47] me013 | uh routinely use it , I mean it just hasn't happened anyway ."
[26:52] fe016 | Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting but it might be
"[26:57] fe016 | a useful , neat"
"[26:59] fe016 | part of the project that we can , you know , show off as"
[27:02] fe016 | a mechanism for synchronizing events in time
"[27:05] fe016 | that happen that you just wanna make a note of , like what Jane was talking about"
"[27:09] fe016 | with some later browsing , just just as a convenience , even if it 's not a full - blown note taking"
[27:15] fe016 | substitute .
[27:16] me022 | Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card .
[27:25] me022 | the the meeting because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the the Linux server
[27:33] me011 | Buttons .
"[27:36] me022 | Well well you have a PDA and may and you could have the same sort of X interface or whatever , I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it ."
[27:40] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:43] me022 | But you could imagine , I mean , if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this"
"[27:44] fe016 | Yeah , that be good ."
"[27:48] me022 | secondary note - taking channel but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort ,"
[27:54] me022 | a PDA with a l a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go .
"[27:57] me022 | I mean even buttons you could do , sort of , I mean , as you said ."
[28:02] fe016 | M right .
"[28:04] fe016 | That would be fine too . I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind but I 'm just sort of thinking"
[28:04] me022 | Right .
[28:17] fe008 | I like this PDA idea . Yeah .
"[28:18] me013 | Yeah , I do like the idea of having a couple buttons where like one one button was "" uh - oh """
[28:19] fe016 | Yeah .
[28:20] fe008 | Yeah .
[28:28] me011 | Action item .
[28:31] me011 | I mean I think the CrossPad idea is a good one .
[28:32] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[28:34] me011 | It 's just a question of getting people to use it and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it 's not a lot of extra work .
[28:40] me011 | I mean that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened is that
[28:43] fe016 | Yeah .
[28:43] me011 | it 's been a lot of extra work for me
[28:45] me013 | Right .
"[28:46] fe008 | Well , and not just for you . But it 's also , it has this problem of having to"
[28:47] fe016 | W
[28:50] fe008 | go from an analog to a d
[28:53] me011 | Well it 's digital but it 's in a format that
[28:56] me011 | is not particularly standard .
"[28:58] fe008 | if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition , right ?"
"[29:02] me013 | No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel"
[29:05] fe008 | OK .
"[29:06] me013 | informa position information , it 's all digital ."
[29:17] me013 | Right .
"[29:18] me022 | The transfer function is less errorful , yes ."
"[29:20] fe016 | Yeah , yeah ."
[29:20] me013 | Yeah .
[29:21] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[29:29] fe016 | I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone but I can imagine some interesting
[29:37] fe016 | and we can
[29:38] fe016 | keep it for a year I don't know .
"[29:40] me011 | w we don't we certainly don't have to return it , as I said . All all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it ."
[29:48] me011 | The point is that we haven't used it at all and are we going to ?
[29:51] me013 | So we have no but uh by I I would suggest you return one .
[29:55] me011 | OK .
[29:55] fe016 | Yeah .
"[29:55] me013 | Because we we you know , we we haven't used it at all ."
[29:56] fe016 | We c
[29:58] fe016 | One would probably be fine .
"[30:00] fe016 | Maybe we could do like a student project , you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like"
[30:04] me013 | Yeah .
[30:05] fe016 | s project for something would be cool .
[30:07] me011 | Yep .
[30:08] me011 | I mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more
[30:12] me013 | Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed .
[30:19] me013 | Yeah .
[30:19] fe016 | Jeremy 's gonna be
"[30:20] fe016 | an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually , which"
"[30:24] fe016 | sounds funny but I think it should be cool , so ."
[30:26] me013 | Yeah .
[30:28] fe016 | OK .
[30:32] me013 | Well dear .
[30:33] me011 | Um .
"[30:36] me011 | That reminded me of something . Oh well , too late ."
[30:38] me011 | It slipped out .
[30:39] me013 | OK .
"[30:39] me011 | Oh , equipment ."
[30:39] fe016 | You 're you 're gonna tease me ? OK .
[30:44] me011 | We ordered uh more
"[30:46] me011 | wireless , and so they should be coming in at some point ."
[30:48] fe016 | Great .
[30:49] me011 | And then at the same time I 'll probably rewire the room as per Jane 's suggestion so that
"[30:54] me011 | uh the first N channels are wireless , eh are the m the close - talking and the next N are far - field ."
[31:11] fe016 | That 's a very philosophical

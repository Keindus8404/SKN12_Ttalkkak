"[00:02] me011 | OK , so we 're live ."
[00:03] me013 | OK .
[00:04] me011 | Are we live or are we Memorex ?
[00:05] me013 | We 're
"[00:06] me025 | OK , so that 's"
"[00:06] me013 | somewhere in between . OK , so we have some sheets for uh some"
[00:08] me025 | Wait .
[00:10] me011 | Right . So .
[00:11] me025 | You 're going to sit there ?
[00:13] me011 | Is that alright ?
"[00:14] me025 | Yeah , OK , maybe I 'll put this thing here then ."
"[00:16] me013 | OK , so this is February second , eh , two thousand , this is eh"
"[00:20] me013 | meeting number one with Adam and Dan and Morgan , about five o ' clock"
[00:25] me013 | uh in the afternoon .
[00:28] me013 | A range of microphones .
[00:28] me025 | Yeah .
"[00:32] me025 | Yeah , that 's that 's the dummy dummy PDA ."
[00:37] me011 | Yep .
"[00:37] me025 | Yeah , it is ."
[00:38] me013 | That 's connected .
"[00:39] me011 | Yeah , both channels ."
[00:39] me013 | It 's got two to both channels .
"[00:40] me025 | Oh , hang on ."
[00:42] me013 | Yeah .
"[00:43] me025 | Yeah , it is at the moment ."
[00:43] me013 | OK .
[00:45] me025 | Yep .
[00:45] me013 | OK .
[00:46] me011 | Although the gain is pretty low .
"[00:48] me011 | So for the um read numbers task ,"
[00:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[00:52] me025 | OK let 's just let 's just name the microphones .
[00:55] me011 | OK .
[00:55] me025 | So I 'm speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing .
[01:02] me025 | OK .
"[01:03] me011 | Right and I 'm now talking on microphone number two ,"
"[01:06] me011 | uh , the wireless microphone number two ."
[01:08] me025 | Yeah .
"[01:08] me013 | Um , I have no idea which one I 'm I 'm on . Oh one ! Oh , I 'm number one ."
[01:11] me025 | You 're on one .
[01:12] me025 | Absolutely .
"[01:13] me013 | OK , which is a a l a lapel , in fact it 's sticking through my lapel ."
[01:18] me025 | Yes .
[01:19] me025 | OK so this is this is the PZM nearest the eh
[01:22] me025 | eh the machine room end of the table .
"[01:25] me011 | Actually , i"
"[01:25] me025 | Then there 's I know , but yeah . It 's number three , it says , but we 'll be able to figure it out . This is at the middle of the table"
[01:32] me025 | This further down the table .
"[01:35] me025 | And this this one is right at the end of the table , OK ?"
[01:42] me025 | This is the left side of the dummy PDA and
[01:44] me025 | this would be the right side .
[01:46] me013 | I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies . @ @
"[01:49] me011 | Yes , it 'll be pretty horrible ."
"[01:50] me013 | Yeah , OK ."
[01:51] me025 | Very exciting .
[01:59] me011 | So what I was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the numbers on the form .
"[02:05] me013 | OK , what do we do with the stuff on top ?"
[02:07] me011 | Fill it out .
"[02:11] me011 | No , you don't need to ."
[02:13] me013 | What are we why are we writing it down ?
[02:14] me011 | So that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing .
[02:19] me013 | Oh .
[02:23] me013 | OK
[02:24] me013 | That 's good . So I don't need to fill that out right now . So maybe we should just say it .
[02:28] me011 | W
[02:28] me025 | OK .
[02:31] me013 | So then we 're not spending the time writing it out . So that we 're spending the time talking .
"[02:34] me025 | Well , how about you give me one of those and we can fill it out and Morgan can read and then we can do it like that ."
[02:38] me013 | I 'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things .
[02:40] me011 | OK .
"[02:41] me025 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[02:42] me013 | Right ?
"[02:44] me011 | And so you have to be sure to pause between each line , since we 're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way ."
[02:44] me013 | Oh .
[02:49] me013 | Right .
"[02:50] me013 | OK , so this is Morgan . I 'm going to read some numbers now ."
[03:21] me013 | That 's my group .
[04:11] me025 | This is these are things we will find out .
[04:11] me011 | That 'll be an issue .
[04:12] me011 | Yep .
"[04:12] me013 | Yeah . I don't know if I said mine was transcript zero , but it was ."
[04:15] me011 | Mm - hmm !
"[04:18] me013 | Oh , good ."
[04:20] me025 | OK .
[04:20] me013 | OK .
[04:21] me013 | That 's a little bit .
[04:22] me025 | Can I
"[04:23] me013 | So , so where are we in this ? Let 's see , so we now we now have a few mikes that work . How long did it take you to set this up ?"
[04:23] me025 | have something to write on the back of ?
[04:25] me025 | Thanks .
"[04:31] me025 | Oh ! It didn't doesn't take Well , I mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well , but it doesn't it doesn't take long to set up . I mean ,"
[04:37] me025 | We just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that .
"[04:41] me011 | Right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around ,"
[04:45] me011 | since it 's it 's more or less the first time we 've tried to do it .
[04:47] me025 | Right .
"[04:48] me025 | The equip Me and Adam went through it yesterday , just looked at everything . But it 's all kind of here and set up , so it 's just a question of turning it all on ."
"[04:56] me011 | I mean , ev eventually we 'll want to like"
[04:57] me025 | running the program .
[04:59] me011 | tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't aren't people aren't tripping over the wires and so on .
[05:02] me025 | Right .
"[05:05] me013 | Are we gonna I mean , is it gonna be over there , or is it gonna be in there ?"
"[05:08] me025 | Um , it 's it 's gonna b it 's for reasons because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there . There 's more equipment in there ."
"[05:16] me025 | But there 's the idea is that there are these microphones on the table , there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat ,"
[05:23] me025 | and then that 's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there .
"[05:27] me025 | And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that so that it 's not open to fiddling ."
[05:35] me013 | So that 's what 's gonna happen .
[05:36] me011 | Right .
[05:38] me025 | That 's
[05:39] me011 | Do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ?
[05:43] me025 | We need to do that . It 's on a list of things to do . I keep on hoping that they 're gonna get done but they don't .
"[05:49] me011 | Well , I I can help them get done um one question is budget . Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that ."
[05:53] me025 | Yeah !
"[05:59] me013 | Oh I mean , I don't know . Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ?"
[06:03] me025 | Yeah .
"[06:06] me013 | Uh , how much are we talking about here ?"
[06:11] me025 | Um .
"[06:13] me025 | I don't know . A cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that ."
"[06:18] me013 | Yeah , I mean , you know , we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it ."
[06:18] me025 | I mean .
[06:21] me025 | Yeah .
"[06:22] me013 | I mean , I think um I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or"
[06:29] me025 | Yeah .
[06:30] me013 | you know .
"[06:30] me011 | Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on ."
[06:39] me013 | Yeah .
[06:40] me011 | So .
"[06:40] me025 | But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible ."
"[06:46] me013 | Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say "" yes , this is where we do such - and - such "" ,"
"[06:53] me013 | and then be able to see uh ,"
"[06:55] me013 | you know ,"
[06:55] me025 | Yeah .
[06:59] me025 | Yeah .
[07:02] me013 | So .
"[07:03] me025 | I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still ,"
[07:06] me025 | which is um
[07:07] me025 | ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have
"[07:10] me025 | any number of these wired headsets , but"
[07:12] me025 | there 's this amplification problem .
"[07:14] me025 | I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy . We 're actually recording I 'm I 'm going through it at the moment , but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this ."
[07:22] me025 | it 's it 's designed to be used for the for the desktop meeting as well .
[07:25] me025 | But I 'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative .
"[07:30] me013 | Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps , I would think ."
[07:35] me025 | Yeah .
[07:35] me025 | It 's just it eh
[07:37] me025 | You see how clumsy this is right ? I have to use these batteries to bias them .
[07:43] me025 | There are like three connectors in the circuit .
"[07:45] me025 | The thing is , like ,"
"[07:48] me025 | it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop ."
[07:57] me025 | So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one .
"[08:01] me025 | And I 'm still not sure . I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this . I can probably"
[08:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[08:05] me025 | build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but"
[08:08] me025 | it 's kind of a buy .
"[08:08] me011 | Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway ."
[08:11] me013 | Are we ?
[08:11] me011 | Sure . Because we we 're gonna have to put it in a PDA .
[08:15] me013 | Well .
[08:17] me011 | Right ? If we have microphones in a PDA it 's gonna need
[08:20] me011 | bias and a pre - amp .
[08:22] me013 | I guess I 'd sort of figured that that Jim would do that at some point . Right ?
[08:25] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[08:26] me025 | Yeah .
[08:27] me025 | Well n
[08:28] me025 | Yeah .
[08:31] me025 | Jim is busy at the moment . That 's the problem . I was kind of hoping that Jim was going to build this box .
[08:35] me025 | But um but he hasn't had time .
[08:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[08:37] me025 | Well , I think I think he is quite interested in doing it . But ."
[08:40] me013 | OK .
[08:40] me013 | Well
"[08:43] me013 | If it 's too noisy and if there 's something we can buy , again for , you know , moderate amount of price , even if it takes a couple boxes or something , maybe we should just do it ."
[08:47] me025 | Yeah .
[08:48] me025 | Yeah .
"[08:55] me013 | Because there may be other considerations that will go into the design . I mean , uh"
"[08:59] me013 | our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are I don't know might change this design ,"
[09:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[09:05] me011 | Right .
[09:06] me013 | So .
[09:08] me013 | There was uh a statement made
[09:12] me013 | uh
[09:14] me013 | there was a statement made at the uh DARPA Communicator meeting I was at recently
[09:19] me013 | that um
"[09:22] me013 | microphone multiple microphones at a distance of less than three feet or something like that were totally useless , completely irrelevant ."
[09:32] me025 | Oh !
[09:33] me013 | Yeah .
[09:34] me013 | for nois noise cancelling .
"[09:36] me013 | Um ,"
"[09:37] me013 | my counter argument is is an uh uh um , a white rat ."
[09:49] me025 | OK .
[09:50] me013 | Yeah .
[09:51] me025 | This happened .
"[09:51] me011 | Do they mean omnidirectional , is that their point ? I mean all the noise cancelling mikes , they 're you know , they 're a few m millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions ."
"[10:00] me025 | I think uh , I mean , uh my guess is that means it 's just that if it 's if it 's near field , the mathematics of beam beam steering is different ."
[10:01] me011 | But .
"[10:07] me011 | Oh , I see ."
[10:07] me025 | If the f if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work .
"[10:13] me011 | It 's Oh , OK , so they 're not talking about how far apart the mikes are , they 're talking about how far they are from the speaker ."
[10:18] me025 | I guess . Yeah .
[10:24] me013 | a uh s a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors
[10:30] me025 | Yeah .
"[10:30] me013 | and you do something cleverer ,"
[10:32] me013 | there clearly are ways to get more out of it .
[10:32] me025 | Yeah .
"[10:33] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[10:34] me025 | Right , right , right . I mean the um"
[10:43] me025 | the the underwater guys do this stuff which is different .
[10:46] me025 | And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible .
[10:54] me025 | And the math is too difficult for me to understand but it 's but it 's there .
[10:56] me013 | Yeah .
[11:04] me013 | this was one of them that was kind of funny .
[11:07] me013 | Um but I I I what I take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing
[11:07] me025 | Yeah .
[11:11] me013 | uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but
[11:12] me025 | Yeah .
[11:16] me013 | I think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb .
"[11:19] me013 | So I I still think it 's potentially interesting to do that . Although we we 'll have to be uh a aware of this if we 're writing proposals about it ,"
[11:20] me011 | Hmm .
"[11:26] me013 | wherever , that there may well be reviewers who will say , "" well everyone knows that you can't get anything out of it if it 's if it 's close "" ."
[11:32] me025 | Yeah .
[11:33] me011 | Do they believe you can get speaker location out of it ? Cuz that 's that 's one way we could sneak it in .
"[11:39] me013 | Uh , that is an interesting point ."
[11:41] me013 | Yeah . Certainly you can
[11:42] me025 | Yeah .
"[11:44] me025 | I mean . By the time We 'll have we 'll have data so we can actually you know , demonstrate that ."
[11:48] me013 | Yeah .
[11:50] me011 | Well .
[11:51] me013 | Hopefully .
"[11:51] me011 | Oh , you mean for location ?"
[11:53] me025 | Yeah .
[11:54] me013 | we we 're getting some right now .
"[11:56] me011 | Yeah , right ."
[11:59] me025 | Right . Right . But I mean .
[12:00] me013 | Well someone someone might be interested in in it .
[12:09] me011 | instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now .
[12:11] me025 | Yeah .
[12:11] me011 | on the thought that my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little PDA in front of us and so the acoustics uh you might want to try to match the acoustics .
[12:20] me013 | Maybe .
[12:21] me025 | Yeah .
"[12:23] me013 | suppose that uh , you 're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a PDA to to a meeting"
"[12:32] me013 | and therefore you bring it in , and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table ."
[12:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[12:42] me025 | and then we can have actual recording with you know three P D As .
[12:48] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:49] me013 | Well , I think we should ."
"[12:50] me013 | I mean , I think at least with two . Right ?"
[12:52] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[12:52] me011 | Right .
[12:53] me013 | Because uh one of the th one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh
"[13:01] me013 | the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they 're a few inches apart ,"
[13:07] me013 | but what if you have two of these things ?
[13:09] me025 | Yeah .
"[13:09] me013 | And you know we have this this idea of the handshake back and forth and say "" I 'm here , I 'm here "" "" We 're now an array . """
[13:13] me025 | Yeah .
[13:13] me011 | Right .
"[13:15] me025 | Right , right ."
"[13:18] me025 | Yeah . And that that seems very uh easy to believe scenario , I mean , given the number of palm pilots we 've got on the table right now , so ."
[13:25] me011 | That 's right .
"[13:26] me011 | Three , right ? So I guess this a pretty dense group but it it 's getting a lot higher ."
[13:27] me025 | Yeah .
"[13:30] me025 | Yeah , but But that it 's"
"[13:36] me025 | We we may be technical , but we 're not particularly PDA people ."
[13:40] me025 | So it 's That 's just how it is .
"[13:41] me011 | Well , I 'm trying to be . So ."
"[13:42] me025 | Well , I know . Well , that 's true . I mean ."
"[13:43] me011 | Except I s got a PDA way before Well I was doing hand I was doing wearable computers at Boeing , so I guess I sort of count . But ."
[13:50] me025 | OK .
[13:56] me013 | uh We 're doing this recording so we show we can we 're capable of doing recording
[14:00] me025 | Right .
[14:00] me013 | uh there 's I guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we 'd wouldn't quite be ready for that .
[14:07] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:09] me013 | Uh .
"[14:09] me025 | Well we 've got we 've got Right now we could have two more people on wireless , with a trip to Leo 's Audio we could get a third extra person on wireless , and uh right now we could have three more three more people wearing mikes like this , and that would just work . I mean I 'm not sure how how good the quality is on this mike but I think it 's going to be OK ."
[14:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:27] me025 | So we could actually have eight people with with headset mikes with , I mean , basically no extra effort ."
[14:34] me011 | Well .
[14:35] me011 | Five with wireless . So we could have eight .
[14:36] me025 | Yeah .
[14:38] me025 | Nine .
"[14:38] me011 | Nine . Excuse me , nine . Five with wireless and four without ,"
[14:39] me025 | Yeah .
[14:41] me025 | Yeah .
[14:42] me011 | and four with wired .
"[14:43] me011 | Um , we don't have headsets though ."
"[14:45] me025 | Yeah . We have the um the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC ."
"[14:49] me011 | Oh , OK so we just have to c wander around and collect them up ."
"[14:52] me025 | Yeah , yeah . I think we have three of those ."
[14:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:54] me025 | So , and the h"
"[14:54] me011 | Uh , there 's one in my office . So ."
"[14:56] me025 | Right , right . They don't all work , but the nice ones , the um Plan - Plantronic ones work ."
[15:02] me013 | OK .
"[15:02] me011 | So , we 'll just have to see if that works ."
"[15:04] me013 | So a little bit of futzing , there 's the issue about a cabinet , we might want to change some pre - amps ."
[15:09] me025 | Yeah .
"[15:09] me013 | So we can do some more recordings but there 's there 's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month , say ."
"[15:14] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[15:15] me011 | Right and also I would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely . So ,"
"[15:20] me011 | um , you know , we 're gonna want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine"
[15:22] me025 | Yeah .
[15:23] me025 | Yeah .
[15:25] me025 | Yeah .
[15:26] me011 | and uh um organize the how we 're gonna store it all .
[15:30] me025 | Yeah .
"[15:30] me013 | Yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today , that that um"
"[15:34] me013 | uh if you downsample it sounded like it came it sounded like it was something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour ,"
"[15:44] me013 | if you used all if you used all no , if you used all the channels . Something like that ?"
[15:48] me025 | We figured out that it was t twelve gig
[15:49] me011 | It was more than that .
[15:54] me013 | I thought it was one gigabyte .
[15:56] me013 | It couldn't be twelve .
"[15:56] me025 | Cuz no , we 've only no , I mean we 've only got four gigabytes and that"
"[16:01] me011 | We said , four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else ."
[16:03] me025 | Yeah .
[16:06] me025 | Right . And then we then we cut it in half .
[16:09] me013 | How 'd you cut it ?
[16:11] me025 | By s saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty instead of thirty - two .
"[16:16] me013 | OK , so that 's so that 's two gigabytes ."
[16:20] me025 | Well no I mean it 's
[16:22] me025 | uh four gigabytes for forty minutes .
[16:24] me013 | Right . But that 's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels .
"[16:24] me011 | So , six gigabytes ."
"[16:26] me025 | Forty - eight kilohertz , yeah ."
[16:28] me025 | So we can actually triple that .
"[16:30] me013 | So you can right , so you can"
[16:32] me011 | Yeah .
"[16:32] me025 | So , hang on so that would OK"
"[16:34] me011 | I came out at the gig an hour , at one point . That that 's one computation I did for sixteen channels , sixteen bit ."
[16:42] me025 | I think it 's two gig an hour .
[16:43] me011 | Is it two gig an hour ? I 'm off by an order of magni That 's alright . Order of two . Factor of two .
"[16:46] me025 | Cuz like , we don't Maybe we don't We don't need to save all channels , right ? So , on average ."
"[16:51] me025 | We could we don't we we wouldn't use all the channels , necessarily ."
[16:59] me025 | Yeah .
"[17:02] me013 | OK , that is a bit more than I thought ."
[17:04] me011 | How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there
[17:08] me011 | to get some of the more space cuz it I mean it 's a nine gig drive and
[17:12] me025 | Yeah .
"[17:12] me011 | there 's four gig on sc on scratch and there 's about three gig unused , it looked like , on the home directory ."
[17:18] me025 | I 'm sure . Yeah .
[17:20] me011 | I just don't know enough about LINUX . How hard is it to repartition ?
[17:23] me025 | It 's a pain .
[17:24] me011 | It 's a pain .
"[17:24] me025 | I mean , you know , because cuz we 've got data on "" user "" , right ? And then we 'd have to"
[17:26] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[17:27] me025 | back it all up and copy it back on again .
[17:34] me013 | um
[17:36] me013 | If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be
"[17:42] me013 | on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow ."
[17:44] me025 | Yeah .
[17:47] me025 | Hmm .
"[17:48] me011 | Right . So I 've I 've already created a "" U U , doctor speech , data , MR "" directory ,"
[17:57] me011 | but there 's not a lot of free space around .
[18:00] me025 | No .
[18:04] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[18:04] me011 | on the drive that I think she 's going to put it on um .
[18:07] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[18:07] me011 | And so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space .
[18:12] me025 | Yeah .
"[18:23] me011 | That 's true . I hadn't even thought about that ,"
[18:27] me011 | although it 'd be kind of interesting .
[18:28] me025 | Yeah .
"[18:30] me025 | You typically train I mean you 'd have fi you 'd have fifty hours we 'd only use one of the PZM channels , something like this , and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels at once ."
"[18:44] me025 | because basically ,"
"[18:45] me025 | if we put them on C Ds then each CD will have all the channels for one recording ,"
"[18:55] me011 | Yeah , it 's pretty horrible ."
[18:56] me013 | So what would we do for training ? So if we 're if we 're training distant mi we 'd just use one of them ?
"[19:01] me025 | Yeah . Well , maybe two of them , but I mean we wouldn't use we 'd only use the distant mikes , right ?"
[19:01] me013 | OK .
[19:05] me011 | Yeah so it might be four .
[19:08] me011 | Right ? But it wouldn't be sixteen .
"[19:10] me013 | Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff ."
[19:14] me011 | But that 's a separate training .
[19:16] me013 | Right . But you don't want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk .
[19:19] me011 | No wait . More disk is better . Absolutely . I mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk . And just not bother .
[19:21] me013 | Yeah .
[19:25] me013 | The thing is it 's really not very expensive right now .
[19:26] me025 | Yeah .
[19:28] me013 | So it 's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and
[19:33] me011 | And back up .
[19:34] me013 | figuring out where it goes .
"[19:36] me013 | Well , we don't it doesn't need to be backed up ."
"[19:37] me025 | if we burn it all on CD - ROM ,"
"[19:39] me025 | then ,"
"[19:39] me011 | Right , then it doesn't need to be backed up ."
"[19:40] me025 | um , in fact , we could"
[19:42] me025 | you know we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that .
"[19:45] me011 | Yeah , we were talking about that . I 'm not sure if anyone 's still using it ."
[19:46] me013 | Yeah .
"[19:49] me013 | I think the only one using it has been Javier ,"
[19:49] me025 | Somebody used it recently .
"[19:51] me013 | but at this point I think it 's he 's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago ,"
[19:56] me025 | Yeah .
[19:58] me011 | I 'll send mail to speech local .
[20:00] me013 | Pardon ?
[20:03] me013 | How much space is that using up ? Do you have any idea ?
"[20:05] me025 | It 's uh twenty C Ds , so that 's twelve gigabytes ."
[20:08] me011 | So that would last us for a while .
"[20:10] me013 | Yeah , couple hours !"
"[20:14] me013 | Well , anyway for this this recording we 're fine cuz we 're only we 're only how many mikes are we recording right now ?"
[20:14] me025 | Yeah .
"[20:18] me011 | Well , right now we don't have any choice . It r still records all sixteen channels . It 's just most of them are all zeroes ."
[20:24] me011 | So that that 's on our list too .
[20:24] me013 | OK .
"[20:26] me013 | Yeah , well that we can"
[20:26] me025 | Yeah .
[20:29] me013 | do something about .
[20:30] me011 | Yep .
[20:32] me011 | It 's mostly a question of user interface . How do we how do we specify which ones are on ?
[20:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:37] me011 | Yeah , so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we ?"
[20:44] me025 | Yeah .
"[20:46] me025 | Probably , we could we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win ."
[20:51] me011 | Run what on those ?
[20:52] me025 | Shorten .
[20:53] me025 | Tony Robinson 's uh lossless compression thing .
[20:56] me011 | OK .
[20:57] me013 | What 's it do ?
"[20:59] me025 | Um ,"
[21:01] me025 | it does AR modeling
[21:17] me025 | So I think it On on each block it 'll it 'll compress you know if there 's load on in any range it 'll use ratio bits . I think it does that .
[21:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[21:25] me025 | @ @
"[21:25] me011 | Yeah , so , P Z Ms ."
"[21:27] me025 | Yeah , well ."
[21:28] me011 | Yeah .
"[21:29] me011 | Yeah , it 's something that that we definitely need to look at with this ."
[21:32] me011 | Maybe we shouldn't 've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try .
"[21:36] me025 | Well , it 's OK , it 's only the first try . I what I 'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel ."
[21:47] me011 | Right .
"[21:48] me011 | Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle sixteen bits ."
[21:54] me025 | Yeah .
"[21:55] me025 | I think probably the bottom four bits are not any good ,"
"[21:58] me011 | Regardless , yeah ."
[21:58] me025 | Right ? Although you know it claims they are . But probably
"[22:03] me011 | W I was just noticing on the on the there 's a view meter , software view meter and the PZM gain is real low . So ."
"[22:09] me013 | Yeah , so I think initially we should take up more space until we 've analyzed this and get a better sense of it because"
[22:15] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[22:17] me011 | Yeah .
[22:22] me011 | Yep .
[22:22] me025 | Yeah .
"[22:27] me013 | Yeah , I was interested when I saw the twenty - four on there . Wow , I mean that 's probably eight bits of noise . Yeah . So ."
"[22:30] me025 | Oh , yeah !"
[22:31] me025 | Oh yeah !
"[22:33] me011 | Yeah , that 's right . We 've got lots of bits of noise ."
[22:37] me025 | These theories things are pretty amazing .
[22:39] me013 | Yeah .
[22:40] me025 | And
[22:41] me025 | And there 's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be
"[22:43] me013 | It 's some sort of oversampling thing I imagine , right ?"
"[22:45] me025 | Oh , God knows . Yeah , yeah ."
"[22:48] me013 | you can't have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million parts , so ."
[22:51] me025 | Right .
[22:57] me025 | Right .
[22:58] me011 | Right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here .
"[23:03] me011 | You know , I assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output ."
[23:05] me025 | That that card that machine 's got sound They 've got a sound blaster built into it .
"[23:09] me011 | Oh , it 's just not working ."
[23:10] me025 | I just I just disabled it cuz I wanted to find out
[23:16] me011 | OK .
"[23:20] me011 | Yeah , that way we don't we can't listen to it on this machine ."
[23:20] me013 | I 'm s
"[23:21] me025 | There 's no ,"
[23:23] me013 | Oh !
[23:26] me025 | For a couple of reasons .
[23:28] me025 | There are two ways we could listen to it . There 's a sound there 's actually sound output built into this thing . But the driver I haven't the driver may not support it yet . And then there 's also the sound or the sound card built in . But I don't know how to I don't know how the operating system would like having two sound cards .
[23:32] me013 | Yeah .
[23:39] me013 | Hmm .
"[23:43] me013 | But we can FTP stuff over , right ? So it 's connected ."
[23:45] me011 | Right .
[23:45] me025 | Yeah .
"[23:46] me011 | And we 've looked at it so we know it 's working . I mean , you can see the little squiggles , and it looks like speech so You just can't listen ."
[23:51] me025 | Yeah .
[23:51] me013 | Yeah .
[23:54] me013 | Yeah .
[23:55] me013 | OK .
[23:57] me013 | Um .
[23:59] me013 | One suggestion I have is that um
"[24:03] me013 | I think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these , right ? I think we should read some more"
[24:06] me011 | Right .
[24:18] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[24:18] me013 | and this is a pretty tiny amount of data .
[24:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[24:23] me011 | Well right I I just did ten per page I could easily do twenty per page .
[24:28] me013 | Yeah .
[24:34] me013 | Well this is us . We 'll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah I think uh .
[24:36] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[24:36] me025 | Yeah .
[24:41] me011 | Sure .
[24:43] me025 | Sure .
"[24:45] me025 | Well no , OK , the question I still have about what we 're going to do is"
[24:46] me013 | OK .
[24:47] me013 | Right .
"[24:49] me025 | what is what eh OK , so we can get the equipment set up so that"
"[24:52] me025 | basically we 're in a situation where we can with , you know , ten minutes of preparation , we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording ."
[25:02] me025 | Um .
[25:04] me025 | What are wh When are we Are we going to do that ? Who are they going to be ? What meetings are we going to record ?
"[25:07] me011 | Us , to begin with ."
[25:10] me025 | So which which meetings What meetings do we have ?
[25:11] me011 | I think that 's the intention .
"[25:13] me025 | I mean like "" us "" being the Meeting Recorder people or "" us "" being anything that speech local does ."
[25:19] me025 | Yeah .
"[25:19] me011 | Um , us other groups . It just depends on how many meetings we 're we 're having . Um ."
"[25:23] me011 | Jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group , some of the AI meetings do it as well ."
[25:29] me025 | And we should have like we should have Decoder meetings and stuff .
[25:29] me011 | And uh
"[25:31] me011 | Exactly exactly . I think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this . And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough ,"
"[25:39] me011 | um , then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well ."
"[25:39] me025 | Yeah , I mean that 's the thing . It 's OK to g"
[25:42] me025 | Right .
"[25:42] me011 | Which I 'm interested in . I mean , that 's one of the things , the whole reason I want a PDA as opposed to a wired room"
[25:44] me025 | Yeah .
[25:49] me025 | Right .
[25:49] me011 | is for spontaneous meetings .
"[25:50] me025 | Well , we 've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case . Cuz that that 's the real goal ."
[25:52] me011 | Right .
[25:53] me011 | That 's right .
[25:54] me011 | That 's why I put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty .
"[25:56] me025 | Right . But I mean if we if we want Jerry 's group to use it then we probably @ @ won't ask them to read any numbers , right ? Cuz ."
"[26:02] me011 | Right . Well , I I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times , just for the novelty ."
[26:05] me025 | Yeah .
[26:06] me013 | I think they would .
[26:07] me013 | And also he 's he 's he 's got at least one woman .
[26:12] me025 | That 's great . I know .
"[26:13] me013 | And we 're we have a little problem of no women ,"
"[26:14] me011 | Boy , that 's abs I had never I hadn't even thought about that ."
"[26:17] me025 | I know , it 's a disaster ."
"[26:18] me011 | Oh , man !"
"[26:23] me025 | It 's alright she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her , right ?"
[26:23] me013 | Yeah .
"[26:24] me013 | Ah , that 's right . That was it . So ."
[26:27] me011 | Maybe we should have the reading group here and force Jane to come .
[26:31] me025 | Yeah .
[26:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[26:35] me025 | Yeah .
[26:41] me025 | We could we could have the reading group in here . Yeah .
"[26:43] me011 | Yeah , I mean it 's a different style . But I think that 's alright ."
[26:44] me013 | Yeah .
[26:44] me025 | I mean .
"[26:46] me025 | Yeah , it 's great ."
[26:47] me013 | Yeah .
"[26:54] me011 | Um , I had another question briefly about transcription . So are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it ? I mean who 's gonna generate the transcripts ?"
[26:55] me025 | OK .
[27:03] me013 | Um
[27:04] me013 | I think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today
"[27:09] me013 | is we should try it a couple different ways ,"
[27:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:12] me013 | so we should try to do it internally , maybe ask ask Jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody"
[27:17] me025 | Mm - hmm
[27:21] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:27] me013 | send the same thing out , or maybe split it in halves or something something like that"
[27:30] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[27:32] me013 | to a to an outside service
[27:34] me013 | and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is .
[27:37] me011 | Right .
[27:38] me013 | And then we can
"[27:40] me011 | Yeah , the the problem of course is that it 's you know , in in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts , potentially ."
[27:40] me013 | assess it .
"[27:50] me025 | Well ,"
"[27:50] me025 | Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , right ? You would send I mean ,"
[27:51] me013 | No .
[27:55] me013 | No .
[28:04] me013 | Right . This was this was the point of having near zero skew . Right ?
[28:05] me025 | Right ?
"[28:08] me013 | So you just pick one ,"
"[28:10] me011 | Oh , you 're right , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[28:10] me013 | with the best sounding one , and give it to somebody and they transcribe it ."
[28:14] me025 | Yeah .
[28:14] me011 | Right .
"[28:15] me011 | So the only thing we 'll have to be careful with is that they 're well , what are they listening to ?"
[28:20] me025 | So so they they 're gonna they 're gonna have to make speaker assignments or something like this .
"[28:24] me011 | They 're going to have to make speaker assignments , and wh and which recording are they gonna listen to ?"
[28:27] me025 | For one of one of @ @ .
"[28:29] me025 | Or we could mix we could mix the the headset mikes , you know , just to make a single"
[28:34] me013 | Right .
"[28:34] me011 | Oh , that would be interesting ."
"[28:35] me025 | and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only , you know you only you"
[28:41] me025 | cut it out when there 's no energy . So you don't @ @ noise .
[28:44] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:45] me013 | Yeah , you could do fancy things , but it seems like that 's enough ."
[28:47] me011 | Yeah .
[28:47] me025 | Yeah .
[28:48] me011 | OK .
[28:51] me025 | If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words
[28:54] me025 | then we can leverage that a lot
"[28:56] me025 | by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this ,"
[28:59] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[29:01] me025 | probably .
[29:03] me011 | Yet .
[29:09] me011 | Um .
[29:09] me025 | Yeah . And Yeah . As much work as you want .
[29:14] me013 | Yeah
[29:20] me025 | Yeah .
[29:29] me013 | um so you know in in principle then it 'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this .
[29:29] me025 | Mm - hmm . Wow .
[29:34] me025 | Yeah .
[29:40] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[29:45] me013 | uh from whoever does it
[29:47] me013 | and um then uh
"[29:50] me013 | like I say , check it out with an external service and see if it 's faster , cheaper , better , worse , whatever . Then we 'll go from there ."
[29:55] me011 | Right .
[29:58] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:00] me011 | Yeah , one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field"
"[30:04] me011 | and we do an initial recognition pass , is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript ,"
[30:11] me011 | if the near field mike does a reasonably good job ?
[30:11] me025 | Hmm .
"[30:15] me011 | I bet it isn't ,"
[30:16] me011 | unless it 's really close to right .
[30:18] me025 | I have just because it 's such an un
"[30:20] me025 | The transcribing is sort of something I can imagine doing ,"
[30:23] me011 | Right .
[30:23] me025 | whereas having this distraction
"[30:29] me011 | Some errors , yeah ."
[30:29] me025 | very wrong bits in
[30:31] me025 | is sort of a less less easy thing to do .
[30:32] me013 | I don't know . I do I don't know the answer to that .
[30:37] me013 | I don't know .
[30:38] me025 | Yeah
"[30:38] me013 | Well , I mean there 's this Cyber Transcriber service , right ?"
"[30:39] me025 | Yeah , that 's true , that 's true ."
[30:41] me013 | And at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them
"[30:45] me025 | Yeah , by fixing up transcripts ."
[30:46] me013 | what is the output of the recognizer .
[30:48] me013 | So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like .
"[30:50] me025 | Yeah , but Yeah ."
"[30:50] me013 | If it 's you know , if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing , or do you point , or I don't know ."
[30:56] me025 | Yeah .
"[31:04] me013 | Ah , the internet ."
"[31:06] me025 | They should all be in India right now . That 's where the good , but the cheap English speakers are ."
[31:10] me013 | Yeah .
[31:12] me011 | Not in Scotland .
[31:12] me013 | Inexpensive .
"[31:13] me025 | I 'm sorry , yeah ."
"[31:17] me011 | They they sheep they s they they speak cheap English , right ?"
[31:24] me025 | Yep .
[31:25] me011 | Sure .
[31:43] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[31:49] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[31:50] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[31:51] me013 | to deal with it rather than this massive thing . That 's a little bit of stuff to do . Right ?
[31:56] me011 | Right .
[31:57] me011 | And then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition
[32:01] me011 | would be interesting to do .
"[32:03] me013 | Yeah , although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest . Yeah ."

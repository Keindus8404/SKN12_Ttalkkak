"[00:12] me013 | And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so ."
"[00:20] mn052 | Oh , OK ."
[00:23] mn052 | Oh ! That 's nice .
[00:24] me018 | Just for a visit ?
"[00:25] me013 | Uh , we 'll see ."
[00:27] me013 | We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something . So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing and
[00:27] me018 | Huh .
[00:30] me018 | Cool .
[00:30] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[00:34] me013 | give us his his thoughts . And so it 'll be another another good person looking at things .
[00:38] mn052 | Oh . Hmm .
[00:40] me026 | Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ? Is that right ?
"[00:42] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[00:42] me026 | Oh , OK . So I guess I should probably talk to him a bit too ?"
"[00:45] me013 | Oh , yeah . Yeah ."
"[00:46] me013 | Yeah . No , he 'll be around for three weeks . He 's , uh , um , very , very , easygoing , easy to talk to , and , uh , very interested in everything ."
[00:53] me018 | Really nice guy .
"[00:54] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[00:55] mn052 | Yeah , we met him in Amsterdam ."
"[00:59] mn052 | Oh , OK . I haven't noticed him ."
[01:03] me013 | N nine months . Something like that . Yeah .
[01:05] me018 | Yeah .
[01:05] me013 | Yeah . He 's he 's done a couple stays here . Yeah .
[01:08] mn052 | Hmm .
"[01:11] me018 | So , um , I guess we got lots to catch up on . And we haven't met for a couple of weeks . We didn't meet last week , Morgan ."
"[01:18] me018 | Um , I went around and talked to everybody , and it seemed like they they had some new results but rather than them"
"[01:24] me018 | coming up and telling me I figured we should just wait a week and they can tell both you know , all of us ."
"[01:31] me018 | why don't we why don't we start with you , Dave , and then , um , we can go on . So ."
"[01:34] me026 | Oh , OK ."
"[01:41] me026 | mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , um , into the SmartKom system ,"
"[02:07] me018 | Twelve twelve seconds back from the current frame , is that what you mean ?"
"[02:10] me026 | Twelve seconds , um , counting back from the end of the current frame , yeah . So it was , um , twen I think it was twenty - one frames and that worked out to about twelve seconds ."
"[02:14] me018 | OK , OK ."
[02:19] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[02:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:28] me018 | Hmm !
[02:28] me026 | Is is that right ?
[02:32] me026 | Uh - huh .
"[02:34] me026 | So that was encouraging . And , um ,"
"[02:37] me026 | that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like SmartKom."
"[02:44] me026 | And , um , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system . So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time , but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ?"
"[02:58] me026 | So I w bef before , um Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds ."
"[03:05] me026 | In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds . And , um ,"
"[03:32] me026 | I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se"
"[03:36] me026 | I think I think it was , um , something like four seconds and ,"
"[03:41] me026 | um , six seconds , and eight seconds . Something like that . And it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using th that same length of time but it it doesn't hurt that much . Um ,"
"[03:53] me026 | u usually less than point five percent , although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate . But this is , um ,"
"[04:04] me026 | w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same"
"[04:11] me026 | length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent . So it doesn't seem like that big a d a difference ."
"[04:26] me026 | That that 's true . Um ,"
"[04:30] me013 | I mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing ."
[04:30] me026 | Wa -
"[04:33] me018 | Yeah , it seems like for your I mean , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech , right ?"
"[04:40] mn052 | You need twelve seconds in the past to estimate , right ?"
[04:41] me018 | I 'm not e u
[04:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[04:44] me026 | Um , t twelve s"
[04:47] me026 | N n uh For the test it 's just twelve seconds in the past .
"[04:47] me013 | No , total ."
"[04:48] mn052 | Oh , OK ."
"[04:50] me018 | Is this twelve seconds of uh , regardless of speech or silence ? Or twelve seconds of speech ?"
[04:55] me026 | Of of speech .
[04:56] me018 | OK .
[04:57] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:03] me013 | that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in"
"[05:09] me013 | you used two seconds , and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds , and when you were six and you basically build up to the twelve seconds . So that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,"
[05:15] me026 | Yeah .
[05:18] me013 | but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .
[05:21] me026 | Right . And that 's actually what we 're planning to do in SmartKom.
[05:24] me013 | OK .
"[05:25] me026 | But s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is ,"
[05:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:29] me026 | "" does it matter what models you use ? Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , um , tra doing the training data ? """
[05:38] me013 | Right .
"[05:48] me013 | mean cepstral subtraction , especially the way you 're doing it , uh , as being a kind of filter ."
"[05:54] me013 | And so , the other thing is just to design a filter ."
"[05:57] me013 | You know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort and and just design a filter ."
"[06:04] me013 | And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior and you loo can look at the start up behavior"
[06:09] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:09] me013 | when you start up with nothing . And and , you know , it will , uh , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , um ,"
"[06:17] me013 | uh , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period , but , um ,"
[06:35] me013 | filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors .
[06:38] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:39] me013 | And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component ."
[06:45] me026 | Hmm .
"[06:54] me026 | Um ,"
[06:56] me026 | you do you mean in my tests so far ?
[06:57] mn052 | Ye - yeah .
[06:59] me026 | Most of the silence has been cut out .
[07:01] mn052 | OK .
[07:02] me026 | Just There 's just inter - word silences .
"[07:04] mn052 | Mm - hmm . And they are , like , pretty short . Shor - Yeah , OK . Yeah ."
[07:06] me026 | Pretty short . Yeah .
[07:09] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[07:12] mn052 | So you really need a lot of speech to estimate the mean of it .
[07:17] mn052 | Yeah .
[07:17] mn052 | Uh - huh .
[07:18] me026 | I saw in my test before .
[07:20] me026 | I was trying twelve seconds cuz that was the best in my test before and that increasing past twelve seconds didn't seem to help .
[07:23] mn052 | OK .
[07:27] mn052 | Hmm .
[07:30] mn052 | Huh .
"[07:30] me026 | th um , yeah , I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system . Like ,"
[07:38] me026 | may maybe if I trained on six seconds it would work better when I only had
"[07:49] me013 | Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you"
"[07:54] me013 | essentially have it build up over time . I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of ,"
"[08:01] me013 | uh , ramp up of a filter anyway . And so you may may just want to think of it as a filter . But , uh , if you do that ,"
"[08:07] me013 | then , um , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while ,"
"[08:14] me013 | it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy ,"
"[08:27] me013 | uh , you get thirty percent . And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing ."
[08:39] me026 | M
[08:40] me018 | Ah . OK .
[08:45] me018 | OK .
"[08:45] me013 | you know , they 'll say something first . And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , "" excuse me ? "" uh , or some I mean it should have some policy like that anyway ."
[08:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[08:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:55] me013 | And and , uh ,"
"[08:57] me013 | uh , in any event they might ask a second question . And it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , uh , improve things . It does improve things , just not as much as he would like ."
"[09:08] me013 | And so , uh , there 's a higher probability of it making an error ,"
"[09:12] me013 | uh , in the first utterance ."
"[09:19] me018 | could have a system where , before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves ,"
[09:24] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:24] me018 | verbally . You know . "" Hi , my name is so - and - so , I 'm from blah - blah - blah . "" And you could use that initial speech to do all these"
[09:25] me013 | Yeah .
[09:30] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[09:30] me013 | Right .
"[09:32] me013 | Oh , the other thing I guess which which , uh ,"
"[09:35] me013 | I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system but but , um ,"
"[09:40] me013 | couldn't you , uh ,"
"[09:42] me013 | if you if you sort of did a first pass I don't know what kind of , uh ,"
"[09:46] me013 | uh , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , uh ,"
"[09:53] me013 | uh , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something . But if you did first pass with , um ,"
"[10:09] me013 | and then , um , once you , uh , actually had the whole utterance in ,"
"[10:14] me013 | if you did , um ,"
"[10:16] me013 | the , uh , uh , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , um , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between ,"
"[10:27] me013 | you know , top N , um , possible utterances or something ,"
[10:31] me013 | you you might it might not take very much time .
"[10:34] me013 | I mean , I know in the large vocabulary stu uh , uh , systems , people were evaluating on in the past ,"
[10:42] me013 | some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass but other people didn't and had multiple passes .
"[10:48] me013 | And , um ,"
"[10:49] me013 | the argument , um , against multiple passes was u u has often been "" but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response "" ."
"[10:58] me013 | And the counterargument to that which , say , uh , BBN I think had , was "" yeah , but our second responses are second , uh , passes and third passes are really , really fast "" ."
[11:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:08] me013 | So , um , if if your second pass takes a millisecond who cares ?"
[11:13] me013 | Um .
"[11:15] me026 | S so , um ,"
"[11:23] me013 | Yeah , so if it turned out to be a problem ,"
"[11:26] me013 | that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing ,"
[11:31] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:38] me013 | is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,"
"[11:46] me013 | um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said ."
"[11:51] me013 | And , uh , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever ."
[11:55] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:57] me013 | And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network ."
"[12:05] me013 | And you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , uh , subtraction ."
[12:12] me026 | Mmm .
"[12:16] me013 | So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass ."
[12:22] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[12:24] me026 | OK .
"[12:25] me013 | um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff ,"
"[12:33] me013 | um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit ,"
"[12:40] me013 | but , uh , which have very low energy ."
[12:42] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[12:45] me026 | OK .
"[12:46] me013 | So , uh I mean , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels . Anyway , I 'm throwing too many things out . But ."
[13:01] me018 | that it ?
[13:02] me026 | I guess that 's it .
"[13:05] me018 | OK , uh , do you wanna go , Sunil ?"
[13:07] mn052 | Yep .
"[13:10] mn052 | Um , so ,"
"[13:12] mn052 | the last two weeks was , like So I 've been working on that Wiener filtering ."
"[13:16] mn052 | And , uh ,"
"[13:18] mn052 | found that , uh , s single like , I just do a s normal Wiener filtering , like the standard method of Wiener filtering ."
[13:26] mn052 | And that doesn't actually give me any
"[13:30] mn052 | I mean , uh , b it actually improves over the baseline but it 's not like it doesn't meet something like fifty percent or something ."
"[13:36] mn052 | So , I 've been playing with the v"
[13:37] me018 | Improves over the base line MFCC system ? Yeah .
"[13:39] mn052 | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So , um So that 's The improvement is somewhere around , like , thirty percent over the baseline ."
"[13:47] mn052 | No , just just one stage Wiener filter which is a standard Wiener filter ."
"[13:50] me013 | No , no , but I mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ? Oh , OK ."
"[13:54] mn052 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . So I just plug in the Wiener filtering ."
"[13:56] mn052 | I mean , in the s in our system , where So , I di i di"
"[13:58] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[14:01] mn052 | No . It actually improves over the baseline of not having a Wiener filter in the whole system .
[14:09] me013 | Yeah ?
"[14:09] mn052 | and then I plug in the Wiener filter in that , so it improves over not having the Wiener filter ."
[14:13] mn052 | So it improves but it it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline .
"[14:20] me013 | But that 's what I 'm confused about , cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering ."
"[14:26] mn052 | No , it 's like , uh ,"
[14:28] mn007 | Mmm .
[14:29] me018 | Is this with the v new VAD ?
"[14:37] mn052 | nine This is like w the baseline is ninety - five point six eight ,"
"[14:44] me013 | So I mean , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually ."
[14:47] mn052 | What was that ? Sorry ?
"[14:47] me013 | If you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ?"
"[14:50] me013 | OK , cuz then you can figure out the percentages ."
[14:53] me013 | Yeah .
[14:53] mn007 | The baseline is something similar to
"[14:56] mn007 | a w I mean ,"
"[14:58] mn007 | the t the the baseline that you are talking about is the MFCC baseline , right ?"
"[15:02] mn052 | The t yeah , there are two baselines . OK . So the baseline One baseline is MFCC baseline that When I said thirty percent improvement it 's like MFCC baseline ."
[15:06] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[15:08] me013 | So so so what 's it start on ? The MFCC baseline is is what ? Is at what level ?
[15:15] mn052 | it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it .
"[15:18] me013 | No , what 's what 's the number ?"
"[15:20] mn052 | Uh , so I I don't have that number here . OK , OK , OK , I have it here ."
[15:34] me013 | Four point three .
[15:35] mn052 | Ten point seven .
[15:37] me013 | What 's ten point seven ?
[15:39] me013 | Ah .
[15:48] mn052 | Forty percent is the high mismatch .
[15:51] me013 | OK .
[15:57] me013 | Not changed .
"[15:58] mn052 | Yeah , it 's like ten point one . Still the same ."
[16:02] mn052 | And the high mismatch is like
[16:06] mn052 | eighteen point five .
[16:08] me013 | Eighteen point five . And what were you just describing ?
"[16:11] mn052 | Oh , the one is this one is just the baseline plus the ,"
"[16:14] mn052 | uh , Wiener filter plugged into it ."
"[16:17] me013 | But where 's the , uh , on - line normalization and so on ?"
"[16:20] mn052 | Oh , OK . So Sorry ."
"[16:22] mn052 | So , with the with the on - line normalization , the performance was , um ,"
"[16:27] mn052 | ten OK , so it 's like four point three ."
"[16:31] mn052 | Uh , and again , that 's the ba the ten point , uh , four"
[16:37] mn052 | and twenty point one .
[16:40] mn052 | That was with on - line normalization and LDA .
[16:43] mn052 | So the h well matched has like literally not changed by adding on - line or LDA on it .
"[16:51] mn052 | I mean , even the medium mismatch is pretty much the same ."
[16:54] mn052 | And the high mismatch was improved by twenty percent absolute .
"[17:01] mn052 | It 's the It - it 's Italian . I 'm talking about Italian , yeah ."
"[17:03] me013 | Italian ? And what did So , what was the , um ,"
"[17:07] me013 | uh , corresponding number , say , for ,"
"[17:10] me013 | um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ? Do you know ?"
[17:13] mn052 | Mmm . @ @
[17:17] mn052 | You have it ?
"[17:18] mn007 | Yep , it 's"
"[17:22] mn007 | uh , eight point , uh , seven , and , uh , thirteen point seven ."
[17:29] me013 | OK . OK .
[17:30] mn052 | Yep . So Thanks .
[17:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:40] me013 | OK .
"[17:40] mn052 | So , uh , this is the"
[17:45] mn052 | with The noise estimation was based on
[17:45] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[17:48] mn052 | first ten frames .
[17:54] mn052 | it doesn't work for Finnish and Spanish because the VAD endpoints are not good
"[18:00] mn052 | to estimate the noise because it cuts into the speech sometimes , so I end up overestimating the noise and getting a worse result ."
[18:06] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[18:06] mn052 | So it works only for Italian by u for using a VAD to estimate noise . It works for Italian because the VAD was trained on Italian .
[18:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:19] mn052 | um , this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the Wiener filter on it ."
"[18:33] mn052 | estimated the new Wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech ,"
[18:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:44] mn052 | I mean , I have I 've I 've observed there are , like , a lot of bumps in the frequency when I do this Wiener filtering which is more like a musical noise or something ."
"[18:51] mn052 | And so by adding another stage of Wiener filtering ,"
"[18:55] mn052 | the results on the SpeechDat - Car was like ,"
"[18:59] mn052 | um So , I still don't have the word error rate . I 'm sorry about it . But the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six ."
[19:06] mn052 | This was again using ten frames of noise estimate and two stage of Wiener filtering .
[19:10] mn052 | And the rest is like the LDA plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .
"[19:16] mn052 | Uh , so this was , like , compared to , uh , uh Fifty - seven is what you got by using the French Telecom system , right ?"
"[19:24] mn007 | No , I don't think so . Is it on Italian ?"
[19:25] mn052 | Y i
"[19:29] mn007 | Oh , yeah , fifty - seven Right ."
"[19:31] mn052 | Yeah , so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six which is like"
[19:37] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[19:37] mn052 | one percent still less than
[19:39] mn052 | what you got using the French Telecom system .
[19:42] me013 | But it 's a pretty similar number in any event .
[19:44] mn052 | It 's very similar .
"[19:45] me013 | Yeah . But again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing , right ?"
[19:49] mn052 | It 's it 's different in a sense like I 'm actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum which they 're not doing .
"[19:55] mn052 | They 're d what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the Wiener filter ,"
[20:00] me013 | Yeah .
[20:08] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[20:08] mn052 | And they filter the original signal using that fil filter ,"
[20:11] mn052 | which is like
[20:13] mn052 | final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up .
"[20:17] mn052 | So this is more like I 'm doing Wiener filter twice ,"
[20:21] mn052 | but the only thing is that the second time I 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level .
[20:29] me013 | OK .
"[20:36] mn052 | I mean , the original spectrum where , like , I the second time I estimate the filter but actually clean up the"
"[20:45] mn052 | seems to be a giving , I mean , that much improvement . I I didn didn't run it for the whole case ."
"[20:58] mn052 | the VAD is very , like , crucial . I mean , just by changing the VAD itself gives you the a lot of improvement by instead of using"
"[21:10] mn052 | when instead of using channel zero and channel one ,"
[21:13] mn052 | because that was the p that was the reason why I was not getting a lot of improvement for estimating the noise .
[21:18] mn052 | So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar
[21:24] mn052 | markers for this noise estimation .
[21:26] me013 | What 's a channel zero VAD ? I 'm I 'm confused about that .
[21:28] mn007 | So it 's the close - talking microphone .
"[21:29] mn052 | Yeah , the close - talking without So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same"
"[21:30] me013 | Oh , oh , oh , oh ."
"[21:35] mn052 | speech , but only w I mean , the same endpoints . But the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one , so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for"
"[21:43] mn052 | channel one for the VAD . I mean , that 's like a cheating method ."
"[21:46] me013 | Right . I mean , so a are they going to pro"
"[21:48] me013 | What are they doing to do , do we know yet ?"
[21:50] me013 | about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ?
"[21:52] mn007 | Yeah , so actually I received a a new document , describing this . And what they did finally is to , mmm ,"
"[22:00] mn007 | uh , not to align the utterances but to perform recognition ,"
[22:10] mn007 | and to take the result of the recognition to get the boundaries
[22:10] mn052 | Which is the channel zero .
"[22:15] mn007 | uh , of speech ."
[22:16] me013 | So it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time . That 's that 's just a rule and we 'd you you were permitted to do that . Is is that it ?
"[22:28] me013 | Oh , so they will send files so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ?"
[22:30] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:31] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:33] mn052 | But actually their alignment actually is not seems to be improving in like on all cases .
[22:33] me013 | OK .
"[22:34] mn007 | Oh , i"
"[22:37] mn007 | Yeah , so what happened here is that ,"
"[22:40] mn007 | um , the overall improvement that they have with this method So Well , to be more precise , what they have is , they have these alignments and then"
"[22:49] mn007 | they drop the beginning silence and and the end silence but they keep ,"
"[22:55] mn007 | uh , two hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech . And they keep the speech pauses also ."
"[23:01] mn007 | Um , and the overall improvement over the MFCC baseline So , when they just ,"
"[23:08] mn007 | uh , add this frame dropping in addition it 's r uh , forty percent , right ? Fourteen percent , I mean ."
[23:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[23:15] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:16] mn007 | Um , which is , um , t"
"[23:21] mn007 | which is the overall improvement . But in some cases it doesn't improve at all . Like , uh , y do you remember which case ?"
[23:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:27] mn052 | It gives like negative Well , in in like some Italian and TI - digits , right ?"
"[23:29] mn007 | Yeah , some @ @ ."
[23:33] mn007 | Right .
[23:33] mn052 | Yeah .
[23:35] mn052 | So by using the
"[23:37] mn052 | endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances , which could be due to the"
[23:40] mn007 | Mmm .
"[23:41] mn007 | Yeah . And Yeah , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real VAD ."
[23:42] mn052 | word pattern .
"[23:51] mn052 | Yeah , yeah ."
[23:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[23:54] me013 | Yeah , c"
"[23:58] mn007 | Uh , well , working on the VAD is still still important I think ."
[24:10] me018 | why are people doing that ? What 's what 's the deal with that ?
[24:10] mn052 | Hmm .
"[24:14] mn052 | OK , so"
"[24:15] mn052 | the Wiener filter ,"
[24:17] mn052 | it 's it 's like it 's like you
"[24:20] mn052 | try to minimize I mean , so the basic principle of Wiener filter is like you try to minimize the ,"
"[24:25] mn052 | uh , d uh , difference between the noisy signal and the clean signal if you have two channels . Like let 's say you have a clean t signal and you have an additional channel where you know what is the"
[24:34] mn052 | noisy signal . And then you try to minimize the error between these two .
[24:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:38] mn052 | So that 's the basic principle . And you
"[24:39] mn052 | get you can do that I mean , if if you have only a c"
"[24:43] mn052 | noisy signal , at a level which you , you w try to estimate the noise from the w"
[24:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:54] me018 | Do you assume the noise is the same ?
"[24:56] mn052 | in yeah , after the speech starts ."
[24:58] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[24:59] mn052 | but that 's not the case in , uh , many many of our cases but it works reasonably well ."
[25:02] me018 | I see .
[25:02] mn052 | And and then you
"[25:05] mn052 | What you do is you , uh b"
"[25:07] mn052 | So again , I can write down some of these eq Oh , OK ."
[25:11] mn052 | Yeah .
"[25:12] mn052 | And then you do this uh , this is the transfer function of the"
"[25:15] mn052 | Wiener filter , so "" SF "" is a clean speech spectrum , power spectrum"
[25:19] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:19] mn052 | And "" N "" is the noisy power spectrum ."
[25:21] mn052 | And so this is the transfer function .
"[25:24] mn052 | And ,"
[25:28] mn052 | Yeah .
[25:34] mn052 | And then you multiply your noisy power spectrum with this . You get an estimate of the clean power spectrum .
"[25:44] mn052 | but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum , what you have ."
[25:49] mn052 | So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions
[25:53] mn052 | and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF .
[25:59] mn052 | So sometimes that becomes zero because you do you don't have a true estimate of the noise .
[26:04] mn052 | So the f filter will have like sometimes zeros
[26:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:07] mn052 | in it because some frequency values will be zeroed out because of that .
[26:10] mn052 | And that creates a lot of
[26:13] mn052 | discontinuities across the spectrum because @ @ the filter .
"[26:17] mn052 | So ,"
"[26:18] mn052 | uh , so that 's what that was just the first stage of Wiener filtering that I tried ."
"[26:22] me018 | So is this , um ,"
"[26:24] me018 | basically s uh , similar to just regular spectral subtraction ?"
"[26:29] me013 | It 's all pretty related , yeah . It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise ."
[26:30] mn052 | Yeah .
[26:37] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[26:37] me013 | And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way . And , uh uh , spectral subtraction is is , uh uh , one approach to it ."
"[26:49] me018 | Do people use the Wiener filtering in combination with the spectral subtraction typically , or is i are they"
[26:54] me018 | sort of
[26:54] mn052 | Not seen .
[26:54] me018 | competing techniques ?
[26:55] mn052 | They are very s similar techniques . So it 's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction .
"[26:58] me018 | Yeah . O oh , OK ."
[26:59] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:01] me018 | I see , I see ."
[27:04] mn052 | Yeah .
[27:06] me018 | Mmm .
"[27:07] me013 | in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor . You sometimes will figure out what the noise is and you 'll multiply"
"[27:22] me013 | even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better . And , uh ,"
[27:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:30] me013 | uh , you know ."
"[27:31] me018 | So why did you choose , uh , Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ?"
"[27:36] mn052 | Uh , the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , Wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which I which I 'm trying , is this sub space approach . So ,"
[27:45] mn052 | Stephane is working on spectral subtraction .
"[27:48] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[27:49] me018 | So you 're sort of trying @ @ them all .
"[27:50] mn052 | Y Yeah , @ @ we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques and then pick some from that pick one ."
"[27:51] me018 | Ah , I see ."
"[27:54] me018 | Oh , OK ."
"[27:55] me013 | I m I mean yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series . So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things"
[27:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:58] mn052 | VA Yeah , VAD . w Yeah ."
"[28:01] me018 | Ah , OK . That makes sense ."
"[28:03] me013 | with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them . Um ."
[28:04] me018 | Yeah .
[28:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:08] me018 | Cool , thanks ."
"[28:09] mn052 | So so one of one of the things that I tried , like I said , was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter ."
[28:09] me013 | Yeah .
[28:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:17] mn052 | Like , you estimate the edge of square and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get , like , flattened out ."
[28:24] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:34] mn052 | the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time . And that seems to be working .
[28:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:39] mn052 | So that 's where I got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on SpeechDat - Car with that .
[28:46] mn052 | So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames .
[28:58] mn052 | which which like sort of shows that by using a proper VAD you can just
"[29:03] mn052 | take it to further ,"
[29:07] mn052 | So .
"[29:08] me018 | So that 's sort of like , you know , best - case performance ?"
"[29:10] mn052 | Yeah , so far I 've seen sixty - seven I mean , no , I haven't seen s like sixty - seven percent ."
"[29:15] mn052 | And , uh , using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving but I don't have the results for all the cases with that ."
"[29:23] mn052 | So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser 2 x frame , which is like ,"
[29:34] me013 | So I 'm I 'm still a little confused . Is that channel zero information going to be accessible during this test .
"[29:41] mn052 | Nnn ,"
[29:42] mn052 | no . This is just to test whether we can really improve by using a better VAD .
[29:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[29:46] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[29:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[29:54] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[29:56] mn052 | so we c
"[29:57] mn052 | so I mean , which which means , like ,"
[29:59] mn052 | by using this technique what we improve just the VAD we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better .
[30:05] me013 | OK .
"[30:06] mn052 | So , that that was just the , uh , reason for doing that experiment ."
"[30:18] mn052 | a lot on the TI - digits , so I 'm like investigating that , why it 's not ."
"[30:37] mn052 | Tried this stuff on the mel as well mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things . But it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result ."
"[30:45] mn052 | So , one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging , after the filtering using the mel filter bank , that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs ."
[30:52] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:53] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[30:54] me013 | Ma -
"[30:54] mn052 | So just th Yeah , th that 's that 's the only thing that I could think of why why it 's giving improvement on the mel ."
[30:55] me013 | Makes sense .
"[31:01] mn052 | And , yep . So that 's it ."
"[31:05] me013 | Uh , how about the subspace stuff ?"
"[31:07] mn052 | Subspace , I 'm I 'm like that 's still in a little bit in the back burner because I 've been"
"[31:11] mn052 | p putting a lot effort on this to make it work , on tuning things and other stuff . So"
[31:16] mn052 | I was like
"[31:17] mn052 | going parallely but not much of improvement . I 'm just have some skeletons ready , need some more time for it ."
[31:27] me013 | OK .
[31:33] me018 | Tha - that it ?
[31:34] mn052 | Yep . Yep .
[31:35] me018 | Cool .
"[31:36] me018 | Do you wanna go , Stephane ?"
"[31:38] mn007 | Uh , yeah . So , I 've been , uh , working still on the spectral subtraction ."
"[31:44] mn007 | Um ,"
"[31:45] mn007 | So to r to remind you a little bit of of what I did before , is just to apply some spectral subtraction with an overestimation factor also to get ,"
"[32:06] mn007 | but subtracting more when the SNR is is , uh , low ,"
[32:11] mn007 | which is a technique that it 's
[32:14] mn007 | often used .
"[32:16] mn007 | So you overestimate the noise spectrum . You multiply the noise spectrum by a factor ,"
"[32:20] me018 | Oh , OK ."
"[32:20] mn007 | uh , which depends on the SNR . So , above twenty DB ,"
[32:23] me018 | I see .
[32:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:28] mn007 | And then it 's b
[32:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:39] mn007 | when the SNR is below zero DB .
[32:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:42] mn007 | Um , doing just this , uh , either on the FFT bins or on the mel bands , um ,"
[32:44] me013 | Oh !
[32:51] mn007 | t doesn't yield any improvement
"[32:53] me013 | Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ?"
[32:54] mn007 | o
[33:01] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:04] mn007 | So what I I just do is to put ,"
[33:08] mn007 | uh to to add to put the threshold first and then to add
"[33:12] mn007 | a small amount of noise ,"
[33:14] mn007 | which right now is speech - shaped .
[33:20] me018 | Speech - shaped ?
"[33:21] mn007 | Yeah , so it 's a it has the overall overall energy , uh pow it has the overall power spectrum of speech ."
"[33:31] me018 | So when y when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at a particular"
[33:32] mn007 | i
[33:36] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[33:37] me018 | frequency bin ?
[33:38] mn007 | Yeah . There can be frequency bins with negative values .
[33:39] me018 | OK .
"[33:41] me018 | And so when you say you 're adding something that has the overall shape of speech ,"
[33:45] me018 | is that in a in a particular frequency bin ?
[33:48] me018 | Or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ?
[33:56] mn007 | but the a the amount of the amount of noise I add is not the same for all the frequency bins .
[34:01] me018 | Ah ! OK . I gotcha . Right .
[34:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[34:14] mn007 | Yeah .
[34:18] me018 | So what does that mean ? I 'm trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get
[34:18] mn007 | Hmm .
[34:22] me018 | a negative . It means that
[34:24] mn007 | That means that Mm - hmm .
[34:24] me018 | at that particular frequency range you subtracted
[34:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[34:41] mn007 | so you don't subtract enough . But sometimes it can be too large also .
[34:45] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:45] mn007 | If if the noise , uh , energy in this particular frequency band drops for some reason ."
[34:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[34:52] mn007 | Mmm .
[34:54] me018 | So in in an ideal word i world if the noise
"[34:58] me018 | were always the same ,"
"[34:59] me018 | then ,"
[35:00] me018 | when you subtracted it
[35:02] me018 | the worst that i you would get would be a zero .
"[35:04] me018 | I mean , the lowest you would get would be a zero , cuz i"
[35:06] me018 | if there was no other energy there you 're just subtracting exactly the noise .
"[35:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm , yeah ."
"[35:10] me013 | Yep , there 's all there 's all sorts of , uh , deviations from the ideal here . I mean , for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , um , at a particular point ."
"[35:20] me013 | And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee"
"[35:25] me013 | that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range . So ,"
[35:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[35:33] me013 | you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is .
"[35:39] me013 | Then you 're subtracting that from another chunk ,"
[35:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:42] me013 | and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , uh , be negative in some places ."
[35:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:47] me013 | Uh , on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake because"
[35:51] me013 | you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise .
[35:56] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:56] me013 | Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated ."
"[36:02] me013 | And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , um , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated or"
[36:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:13] me013 | assuming , uh , ergodicity that i that i um , across time , uh , it 's uncorrelated ."
"[36:19] me013 | But if you just look at a quarter second ,"
"[36:24] me013 | uh , and you cross - multiply the two things , uh , you could very well , uh , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero . So in fact , the two"
"[36:34] me013 | signals could have some relation to one another . And so there 's all sorts of deviations from ideal in this . And and given all that , you could definitely end up with something that 's negative ."
"[36:45] me013 | But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum ,"
"[36:51] me013 | um ,"
[36:52] me013 | then it can be bad to have something negative .
"[36:55] me013 | Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ?"
[37:02] mn052 | Is that the log ?
"[37:04] me013 | Um , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ?"
[37:06] mn052 | After that .
"[37:08] mn052 | No , after ."
"[37:09] me013 | Right . So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often"
"[37:15] me013 | you would end up with , uh with negative values ."
"[37:19] mn052 | But you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , right ?"
[37:24] mn052 | When you add the negative to the positive value which is the true estimate .
[37:28] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:30] me013 | But nonetheless , uh , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ? that you 're doing ."
"[37:36] me013 | Right . So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be , and now i then you 've subtracted it off ."
"[37:43] me013 | And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up ."
[37:53] mn052 | Hmm .
"[37:53] me013 | Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either , right ?"
"[37:58] mn052 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[37:59] me013 | So , um , uh , i in fact ,"
"[38:04] me013 | what you 'd be doing is saying , "" well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in"
[38:17] mn052 | Yeah . Uh - huh .
"[38:17] me018 | Sort of the opposite of that would be if if you find out you 're going to get a negative number ,"
[38:21] me018 | you don't do the subtraction for that
[38:23] me018 | bin .
[38:25] mn052 | That is true .
[38:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:27] me018 | That would be almost the opposite , right ?"
"[38:30] me018 | Instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it ."
"[38:33] me018 | If your if your subtraction 's going to result in a negative number , you you don't do subtraction"
[38:38] me018 | in that .
"[38:39] me013 | Yeah , but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it ."
[38:45] me018 | Yeah .
[38:46] mn052 | We just Yeah .
"[38:46] me013 | Uh . Yeah . Well , yeah that 's that 's the opposite , yeah ."
"[38:46] me018 | Yeah , I 'm just saying that 's like the opposite . Yeah ."
[38:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:50] mn007 | And , yeah , some people also if it 's a negative value they , uh , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the edges and bins . Well , there are different things that you can do ."
"[38:59] mn052 | For frames , frequency bins ."
[38:59] me013 | Yeah .
[39:01] me018 | Oh .
[39:08] me018 | Oh .
[39:09] me013 | instead of half wave . But it was just a thought that that it might be something to try .
[39:10] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[39:13] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:15] mn007 | Yep . Well , actually I tried , something else based on this , um ,"
[39:25] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:41] mn007 | Yeah , let me go back a little bit . Actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can ,"
"[39:48] mn007 | uh , find this this equivalent in the s in the spectral domain . You can uh compute , y you can say that d your spectral subtraction is a filter , um , and the gain of this filter is the , um ,"
"[40:03] mn007 | signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy ."
[40:23] mn007 | what happen actually is that
"[40:26] mn007 | during low SNR values , the gain is close to zero but it varies a lot ."
[40:43] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[40:47] mn007 | Mmm .
"[40:49] mn007 | So the smoothing is I did a smoothing actually on this gain , uh , trajectory ."
"[40:55] mn007 | But it 's the smoothing is nonlinear in the sense that I tried to not smooth if the gain is high , because in this case we know that ,"
"[41:05] mn007 | uh , the estimate of the gain is correct because we we are not close to to to zero ,"
"[41:12] mn007 | um , and to do more smoothing if the gain is low ."
[41:17] mn007 | Mmm .
[41:19] mn007 | Um .
"[41:22] mn007 | Yeah . So , well , basically that 's this idea , and"
"[41:30] mn007 | uh , although I 've just just tested on Italian and Finnish ."
"[41:35] mn007 | And on Italian it seems my result seems to be a little bit better than the Wiener filtering , right ?"
"[41:41] mn052 | Mm - hmm . Yeah , the one you showed yesterday . Right ?"
[41:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[41:44] mn007 | Uh , I don't know if you have these improvement the detailed improvements for Italian , Finnish , and Spanish there or you have just have your own ."
"[41:49] mn052 | No , I don't have , for each , I I just just have the final number here ."
"[41:52] me013 | So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ?"
"[41:58] mn052 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . So so , no , I actually didn't give you the number which is the final one , which is , after two stages of Wiener filtering ."
[41:58] me013 | Yeah .
"[42:04] mn052 | I mean , that was I just well , like the overall improvement is like fifty - six point five ."
[42:08] me013 | Right .
"[42:08] mn052 | So , I mean , his number is still better than what I got in the two stages of Wiener filtering ."
[42:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[42:10] mn007 | Yeah .
[42:13] me013 | Right .
[42:17] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[42:19] me013 | But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ?
"[42:21] mn007 | Yeah . Uh , so , it 's , uh , three point , uh , eight ."
[42:26] me013 | Uh - huh .
[42:28] mn007 | Am I right ?
"[42:29] mn052 | Oh , OK . Yeah , right , OK ."
"[42:31] mn007 | And then , uh , d uh , nine point , uh , one ."
[42:34] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:35] mn007 | And finally , uh , sixteen point five ."
[42:49] me013 | On - line normalization and LDA ? Yeah .
"[42:52] mn007 | Yeah . But instead of double stage Wiener filtering , it 's it 's this smoothed spectral subtraction . Um , yeah ."
[42:52] me013 | Yeah .
[43:00] me013 | Right .
"[43:01] me018 | What is it the , um ,"
[43:02] me018 | France Telecom system uses
"[43:07] mn052 | They use spectral subtraction , right ."
[43:09] mn007 | For what ?
[43:10] mn052 | French Telecom .
"[43:12] mn052 | Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering . Sorry ."
[43:13] me018 | Oh .
"[43:14] mn052 | Yeah , filtering . Yeah , it 's not exactly Wiener filtering but some variant of Wiener filtering ."
[43:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[43:17] me018 | I see .
[43:19] mn052 | Yeah .
[43:21] mn052 | s
[43:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[43:30] mn052 | some smoothing techniques on the final filter . The th they actually do the filtering in the time domain .
[43:33] me018 | Mmm .
[43:34] mn007 | Yeah .
"[43:36] mn052 | So they would take this HF squared back , taking inverse Fourier transform ."
[43:36] me018 | Hmm .
[43:41] mn052 | And they convolve the time domain signal with that .
"[43:44] me018 | Oh , I see ."
"[43:44] mn052 | And they do some smoothing on that final filter , impulse response ."
[43:48] me018 | Hmm .
"[43:48] mn007 | But they also have two two different smoothing @ @ . One in the time domain and one in the frequency domain by just taking the first , um , coefficients of the impulse response ."
"[44:01] mn007 | So , basically it 's similar . I mean , what you did , it 's similar because you have also two two kind of smoothing . One in the time domain , and one in the frequency domain , yeah ."
[44:08] mn052 | Yeah .
[44:10] mn052 | Yeah .
[44:11] mn052 | The frequency domain .
"[44:15] me018 | Well , do you get this musical noise stuff with Wiener filtering or is that only with , uh , spectral subtraction ?"
"[44:19] mn052 | No , you get it with"
[44:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[44:21] mn052 | Wiener filtering also .
[44:22] me018 | Does the smoothing in the time domain help with that ?
[44:25] me018 | Or
"[44:25] mn052 | Oh , no , you still end up with zeros in the s spectrum . Sometimes ."
[44:27] me018 | some other smoothing ?
[44:29] mn007 | Yeah .
"[44:30] me013 | I mean , it 's not clear that these musical noises hurt us in recognition . We don't know if they do . I mean , they they sound bad ."
[44:30] me018 | Hmm .
[44:33] me018 | Hmm .
[44:34] mn052 | Yeah .
"[44:36] me013 | But we 're not listening to it , usually ."
[44:36] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:36] mn052 | Yeah , I know ."
[44:37] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[44:38] me018 | Hmm .
[44:45] mn007 | Mmm .
"[44:47] mn007 | Well , I cannot you cannot hear beca well , actually what I d did not say is that this is not in the FFT bins . This is in the mel frequency bands ."
"[44:59] mn007 | So , it could be seen as a f a a smoothing in the frequency domain because I used , in ad mel bands in addition and then the other phase of smoothing in the time domain ."
"[45:17] mn007 | in silence portions , and at the beginning and end of speech , you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram ."
[45:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:29] me018 | That 's the musical noise ?
[45:30] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:32] mn007 | If you listen to it uh , if you do this in the FFT bins , then you have spots of energy randomly distributing . And if you f if you re - synthesize these spot sounds as ,"
[45:43] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:47] me013 | Well , none of these systems , by the way , have I mean , y you both are are working with , um , our system that does not have the neural net , right ?"
[45:57] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[45:57] mn052 | Yep . Yeah .
[45:57] me013 | OK .
[45:59] mn007 | Yeah .
"[45:59] me013 | So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before ."
"[46:15] mn007 | one of the reason , uh , the n system with the neural net was ,"
"[46:20] mn007 | um , more than well , around five percent better , is that it was much better on"
"[46:27] mn007 | highly mismatched condition . I 'm thinking , for instance , on the TI - digits trained on clean speech and tested on noisy speech ."
[46:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:35] mn007 | Uh , for this case , the system with the neural net was much better . But not much on the in the other cases . And"
[46:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[46:43] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:44] mn007 | if we have no , uh , spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering , um , i the system is Uh , we thought the neural neural network is much better than before ,"
[47:03] me013 | Maybe .
[47:04] me018 | Could you train a neural net to do spectral subtraction ?
"[47:07] me013 | Yeah , it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction but I don't know if it I mean , you have to figure out what your targets are ."
[47:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:15] me018 | Yeah , I was thinking if you had a"
"[47:17] me018 | clean version of the signal and and a noisy version ,"
[47:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:20] me013 | Right .
[47:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:21] me018 | and your targets were the
[47:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:30] me018 | People do that ?
"[47:30] me013 | y yeah , in fact , we had visitors here who did that I think when you were here ba way back when ."
[47:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:36] me018 | Hmm .
"[47:36] me013 | Uh , people d done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets . And it 's not a bad thing to do . It 's another approach ."
[47:43] me018 | Hmm .
[47:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:44] me013 | M I mean , it 's it , um The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um ,"
[47:50] me013 | it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean but then you get a different noise .
[47:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:55] me013 | And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some ,"
"[48:01] me013 | um , gentleness"
[48:11] me013 | another way to go .
"[48:15] me018 | uh , stuff that it was trained on ? Did it do pretty well ?"
"[48:19] me013 | Oh , yeah , it did very well ."
[48:20] me018 | Mmm .
[48:20] me013 | Yeah .
[48:21] me018 | Mmm .
[48:21] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:22] me013 | Um , but to some extent that 's"
"[48:27] me013 | kind of what we 're doing . I mean , we 're not doing exactly that , we 're not"
"[48:32] me013 | trying to generate good examples but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can ,"
[48:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:38] me013 | for these little phonetic categories ,"
[48:40] me018 | You could say it 's sort of built in .
"[48:41] me013 | It 's Yeah , it 's kind of built into that . And and that 's why we have found that it it does help ."
[48:43] me018 | Hmm .
[48:46] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:46] me013 | Um so , um , yeah , I mean , we 'll just have to try it . But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some ."
"[48:53] me013 | I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same , but I would imagine it would help some ."
[48:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:00] me013 | So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system . OK ?"
"[49:03] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[49:04] mn007 | Um ,"
"[49:10] mn007 | Well , actually , this was kind of the first try with this spectral subtraction plus smoothing , and I was kind of excited by the result ."
[49:16] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[49:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:20] mn007 | Um , then I started to optimize the different parameters . And ,"
"[49:27] mn007 | uh , the first thing I tried to optimize is the , um , time constant of the smoothing ."
[49:32] mn007 | And it seems that the one that I chose
[49:36] mn007 | for the first experiment was
"[49:50] mn007 | it 's important to mention is , um , that this has a this has some additional latency ."
[49:58] mn007 | Um .
"[50:01] mn007 | Because when I do the smoothing ,"
"[50:04] mn007 | uh , it 's a recursion that estimated the means , so of the g of the gain curve . And"
"[50:12] mn007 | this is a filter that has some latency . And I noticed that it 's better if we take into account this latency . So , instead o of using"
[50:34] me018 | And that 's what causes the latency ?
[50:35] mn007 | Yeah .
[50:36] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[50:36] me018 | OK .
"[50:41] mn007 | It 's the recursion , so it 's it 's the center recursion , right ?"
[50:45] mn052 | Mm - hmm .
[50:45] mn007 | Um and the latency of this recursion is around fifty milliseconds .
[50:50] me013 | One five ?
[50:50] mn007 | @ @
[50:52] me013 | One five ? Five zero ?
"[50:53] mn007 | Five zero , yeah ."
[50:54] me013 | Five zero . Yeah .
"[50:55] mn007 | Um , mmm ."
"[50:58] mn052 | I 'm sorry , why why is that delay coming ? Like , you estimate the mean ?"
"[51:02] mn007 | Yeah , the mean estimation has some delay , right ?"
"[51:05] mn007 | I mean , the the filter that that estimates the mean has a time constant ."
"[51:06] mn052 | Oh , yeah ."
"[51:08] mn052 | It isn't OK , so it 's like it looks into the future also ."
[51:10] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:11] mn052 | OK .
[51:11] me013 | What if you just look into the past ?
"[51:13] mn007 | It 's , uh , not as good ."
[51:17] me013 | How m by how much ?
[51:20] me013 | By how much ?
"[51:22] mn007 | It 's around three percent , um , relative ."
[51:30] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:32] me013 | Hmm .
[51:38] me013 | It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out we may or may not be able to add any latency .
"[51:43] mn007 | Yeah , but Yeah ."
"[51:46] mn007 | So , yeah , it depends . Uh , y actually , it 's it 's l it 's three percent . Right ."
[51:51] mn007 | Mmm .
"[51:54] mn007 | Yeah , b but I don't think we have to worry too much on that right now while you kno ."
[52:07] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:07] me013 | Because if we completely ignore latency ,"
"[52:11] me013 | and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind ."
"[52:16] me013 | So , um ,"
"[52:18] me013 | you know , maybe you could"
[52:20] me013 | make it twenty - five . You know what I mean ?
[52:21] mn007 | Yeah .
[52:22] mn007 | Oh yes .
"[52:23] me013 | Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something ."
[52:25] mn007 | s
[52:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[52:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[52:30] me013 | OK .
[52:40] me018 | Sorry . A quick question just about the latency thing . If if there 's another part of the system that causes a latency of
"[52:45] me018 | a hundred milliseconds ,"
[52:47] me018 | is this an additive thing ? Or c or is yours hidden in that ?
[52:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:50] mn007 | No , it 's it 's added ."
[52:52] me018 | It 's additive . OK .
[52:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:54] mn052 | We can OK . We can do something in parallel also , in some like some cases like , if you wanted to do voice activity detection ."
[53:01] me018 | Uh - huh .
[53:02] mn052 | And we can do that in parallel with some other filtering you can do . So you can make a decision on that
[53:03] mn007 | Mmm .
[53:09] mn052 | voice activity detection and then you decide whether you want to filter or not . But by then you already have the sufficient samples to do the filtering .
[53:09] mn007 | Yeah .
[53:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[53:16] mn052 | So So , sometimes you can do it anyway ."
"[53:20] me018 | Couldn't you just also I mean , i if you know that the l the largest latency in the system is"
"[53:25] me018 | two hundred milliseconds , don't you couldn't you just buffer up that number of frames and then"
[53:28] mn052 | Yeah .
[53:28] me018 | everything uses that buffer ? And that way
[53:31] me018 | it 's not additive ?
"[53:33] me013 | Well , in fact , everything is sent over in buffers cuz of isn't it the TCP"
"[53:39] mn052 | You mean , the the data , the super frame or something ?"
[53:40] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[53:41] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
[53:42] mn007 | Yeah .
"[53:43] mn052 | Yeah , but that has a variable latency because the last frame doesn't have any latency and first frame has a twenty framed latency . So you can't r rely on that latency all the time ."
[53:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[53:53] me013 | Yeah .
[53:54] mn052 | Because I mean the transmission over over the air interface is like a buffer . Twenty frame twenty four frames .
[53:55] mn007 | Yeah .
[53:59] me018 | Yeah .
[54:00] me018 | Yeah .
[54:01] mn052 | So But the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty - four frame buffer has a twenty - four frame latency . And the last frame doesn't have any latency .
[54:08] mn052 | Because it just goes as Yeah .
"[54:09] me018 | Yeah , I wasn't thinking of that one in particular but more of , you know , if if there is some part of your system that has to buffer twenty frames ,"
[54:15] me013 | Yeah .
"[54:15] me018 | uh , can't the other parts of the system draw out of that buffer and therefore not add to the latency ?"
[54:21] me013 | Yeah . And and that 's sort of one of the all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee .
[54:28] me018 | Oh !
[54:30] me018 | Hmm .
[54:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:36] mn007 | Yeah . So , um ,"
"[54:41] mn007 | there is uh , these parameters that I still have to to look at . Like , I played a little bit with this overestimation factor ,"
"[54:50] mn007 | uh , but I still have to to look more at this , um , at the level of noise I add after ."
"[55:01] mn007 | Uh , I know that adding noise helped , um , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing , but I don't know"
"[55:09] mn007 | right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one . Same thing for the shape of the the noise ."
[55:20] mn007 | Maybe it would be better to add just white noise instead of speech shaped noise .
[55:24] me013 | That 'd be more like the JRASTA thing in a sense . Yeah .
[55:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[55:29] mn007 | Um , yep ."
"[55:35] mn007 | Yeah , for this I just use as noise estimate the mean , uh , spectrum of the first twenty frames of each utterance ."
"[55:46] mn052 | I used ten just ten frames . Yeah , because I mean , the reason was like in TI - digits I don't have a lot . I had twenty frames most of the time ."
[55:48] mn007 | The ten frames ?
[55:52] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[55:54] mn007 | Um . But , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by t"
"[56:00] mn052 | Well , that 's that 's using the channel zero ."
"[56:05] mn007 | Oh , OK . But this is ten frames plus plus"
"[56:10] mn007 | Uh , no , these results with two stage Wiener filtering is ten frames but possibly more . I mean , if channel one VAD gives you Yeah ."
[56:11] mn052 | Hmm .
[56:18] mn052 | f
[56:19] mn052 | Yeah .
[56:21] mn052 | Yeah .
"[56:29] mn007 | So I expected it to be a little bit better , if , uh , I use more more frames ."
[56:36] mn007 | Um .
"[56:39] mn007 | OK , that 's it for spectral subtraction . The second thing I was working on is to , um ,"
"[57:06] mn007 | which is technique that , um , takes a bunch of frame , um , and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes a look at the minima"
"[57:31] mn007 | And there is something more to this actually . What is done is that , uh , these minima are computed , um , based on , um ,"
[57:56] me018 | So you have one minimum for each frequency ?
"[57:59] mn007 | What what I what I d uh , I do actually , is to take a bunch of to take a tile on the spectrogram and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide ."
[58:10] me018 | Mmm .
"[58:16] mn007 | Uh , in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have a voiced sound , because it 's it 's the FTT bins . And when you take the m the minima of of these this tile ,"
"[58:33] mn007 | If you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because"
"[58:41] mn007 | And If you have other other kind of speech sounds then it 's not the case , but if the time frame is long enough ,"
"[58:49] mn007 | uh , like s five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , uh , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy ."
[59:00] me013 | I 'm confused . You said five hundred milliseconds but you said sixty - four milliseconds . Which is which ? What ?
[59:00] mn007 | Mmm ?
"[59:09] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[59:11] mn007 | Um , actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , um , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , uh , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch ,"
"[59:25] mn007 | uh , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha uh , correctly separated ."
[59:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[59:33] mn007 | they will overestimate the noise a lot .
"[59:41] me013 | Uh , what do you do over five hundred ?"
"[59:43] mn007 | So I take to I take a bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds ,"
[59:48] me013 | Ah . OK .
"[59:50] mn007 | and then I look for the minima ,"
[59:53] me013 | I see .
[59:53] me018 | Mmm .
"[59:54] mn007 | on the on on the bunch of uh fifty frames , right ?"
[59:57] me013 | I see .
[59:57] mn007 | Mmm .
"[00:00] mn007 | So the interest of this is that , as y with this technique you can estimate u"
"[00:10] mn007 | of signal , so if the the n the noise varies a lot , uh , you can track better track the noise ,"
[00:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:17] mn007 | which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector . So even if there are no no speech pauses , you can track the noise level ."
"[00:27] mn007 | The only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least ."
[00:34] mn007 | Cuz this these will help you to to track the the noise level .
"[00:41] mn007 | Um . So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate ,"
"[00:52] mn007 | first on SpeechDat - Car Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually . And it 's , uh , slightly worse , like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based estimates ."
"[01:10] mn007 | I think the reason why it 's not better , is that the SpeechDat - Car noises are all stationary ."
"[01:16] mn007 | Um . So , u"
"[01:19] mn007 | y y there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive and Uh , well , they are mainly stationary . Um ."
[01:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:28] mn007 | But , I expect s maybe some improvement on TI - digits because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable ."
"[01:36] mn007 | Uh , so I have to test it . Mmm ."
"[01:45] me013 | Uh , when you compare it with the V A D - based ,"
"[01:51] mn007 | It 's the France - Telecom - based spectra , s uh , Wiener filtering and VAD . So it 's their system but just I replace their noise estimate by this one ."
"[02:04] me013 | Oh , you 're not doing this with our system ?"
"[02:06] mn007 | In i I 'm not No , no ."
"[02:09] mn007 | Yeah , it 's our system but with just the Wiener filtering from their system ."
[02:15] mn007 | Right ?
[02:17] mn007 | Mmm .
[02:18] me013 | OK .
[02:19] mn007 | Yeah .
"[02:20] mn007 | Actually , th the best system that we still have is ,"
"[02:24] mn007 | uh , our system but with their noise compensation scheme , right ?"
"[02:29] mn007 | So I 'm trying to improve on this , and by by replacing their noise estimate by , uh , something that might be better ."
[02:38] me013 | OK . But the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires a a noise estimate .
[02:41] mn007 | Yeah .
[02:45] mn007 | Yeah . But I di
[02:46] me013 | Couldn't you try this for that ? Do you think it might help ?
"[02:48] mn007 | Not yet , because I did this in parallel , and I was working on one and the other . Um ,"
"[02:49] me013 | I see , I see ."
[02:52] me013 | Yeah .
"[02:55] mn007 | Yeah , for for sure I will . I can try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction ."
[02:55] mn052 | Yeah .
[02:58] me013 | OK .
[02:58] mn052 | So I 'm also using that
[03:00] mn052 | n new noise estimate technique on this Wiener filtering what I 'm trying .
[03:03] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:04] mn052 | So I I have , like , some experiments running , I don't have the results ."
[03:04] me013 | Yeah .
[03:07] me013 | Yeah .
[03:07] mn052 | So . I don't estimate the f noise on the ten frames but use his estimate .
[03:11] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[03:11] me013 | Yeah .
[03:13] mn007 | Um .
"[03:22] mn007 | spectral whitening idea which is in the , um , Ericsson proposal ."
"[03:30] mn007 | Uh , the idea is just to"
"[03:33] mn007 | um , flatten the log ,"
"[03:37] mn007 | uh , spectrum ,"
"[03:41] mn007 | um , and to flatten it more if the the probability of silence is higher ."
"[03:50] mn007 | So in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes , because"
[04:01] mn007 | the the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions . Um .
[04:10] mn007 | Yeah .
"[04:11] mn007 | With this , no improvement , uh , but there are a lot of parameters that we can play with and ,"
"[04:18] mn007 | um Actually , this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping because ,"
"[04:24] mn007 | um , you could just put the threshold and say that "" below the threshold ,"
"[04:30] mn007 | I will flatten comp completely flatten the the spectrum "" . And above this threshold ,"
"[04:36] mn007 | uh , keep the same spectrum ."
"[04:48] mn007 | uh , w you would have some kind of dummy frame which is a perfectly flat spectrum ."
"[04:53] mn007 | And this , uh , whitening is something that 's more soft because ,"
"[04:58] mn007 | um ,"
"[05:01] mn007 | you whiten you just , uh , have a function the whitening is a function of the speech probability , so it 's not a hard decision ."
[05:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:11] mn007 | Um , so I think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and"
"[05:18] mn007 | when we are not sure about if it 's speech or silence , well ,"
[05:22] mn007 | maybe it has something do with this .
"[05:27] me013 | in JRASTA we were essentially adding in , uh , white uh , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise ."
[05:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:35] me013 | On the overall estimate of the noise . Uh , I think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there ."
[05:42] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:47] me013 | where the amount that you added in was ,"
"[05:50] me013 | uh , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise ."
[05:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[05:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:00] mn007 | Yeah , w"
[06:06] mn007 | the noise spectrum .
[06:06] me013 | Yeah .
[06:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[06:14] me013 | Cuz that that brings in
[06:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:17] me013 | sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , uh , this other estimate . So it could be it could be interesting ."
[06:22] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[06:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[06:32] me013 | It went a little long ?
[06:40] me018 | I think we 're OK .
[06:41] me013 | OK .
[06:43] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:54] mn007 | as the Ericsson proposal but , um , the probability of speech is not computed the same way . And"
"[07:05] mn007 | I think , i for yeah , for a lot of things , actually a g a good"
[07:15] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[07:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[07:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:27] mn007 | S so , yeah ."
[08:00] mn007 | And so I 'm starting to obtain alignments on these databases .
"[08:06] mn007 | Um , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone ."
[08:14] mn007 | And then I aligned I obtained the Viterbi alignment of the training utterances .
"[08:22] mn007 | It seems to be , uh i"
[08:29] mn052 | No .
"[08:31] mn052 | So , it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one ."
[08:34] mn007 | What ?
"[08:35] mn052 | Uh , you mean their d the frame dropping , right ?"
[08:38] mn007 | Yeah .
[08:51] mn052 | TI - digits .
[08:53] mn052 | @ @
"[08:54] mn007 | Uh , yeah . And it seems to work on Italian but not on the Finnish and Spanish data ."
"[09:00] mn007 | So , maybe one reason is that s s Finnish and Spanish noise are different . And"
"[09:07] mn007 | actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for Finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things , right ?"
[09:16] mn052 | Yeah .
"[09:17] mn007 | Um Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment"
"[09:24] mn007 | to train on these databases , and , um , also to , um , try different kind of features , uh , as input to the VAD network ."
"[09:35] mn007 | And we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try like , um ,"
"[09:41] mn007 | the spectral slope , the , um , the degree o degree of voicing with the features that , uh , we started to develop with Carmen ,"
"[09:51] mn007 | um , e with , uh , the correlation between bands"
[09:59] mn052 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[10:03] mn052 | The energy also .
[10:05] mn052 | Yeah .
"[10:06] me013 | Yeah , right ."
"[10:13] me013 | OK . Well , Hans - Guenter will be here next week so I think he 'll be interested in all all of these things . And , so ."
[10:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[10:19] me013 | Mmm .
[10:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[10:27] me018 | Want to go ahead , Morgan ?"
[10:28] me013 | Sure .
[13:43] me018 | OK .

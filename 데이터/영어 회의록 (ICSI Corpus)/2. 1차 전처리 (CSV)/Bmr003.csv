"[00:22] me022 | This is Eric on channel three , I believe ."
[00:25] me011 | OK .
"[00:31] me011 | Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane ."
"[00:39] fe008 | OK , this is Jane on channel five ."
"[00:41] me011 | Uh , I still don't see you Jane ."
"[00:42] fe008 | Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ?"
[00:43] me028 | Can you see me on channel four ?
[00:44] me028 | Really ?
[00:46] me028 | My lucky day .
"[00:46] fe008 | Uh , screen no , it is , oh , maybe it just warmed up ?"
"[00:46] me011 | Yeah , I s"
[00:50] me011 | No .
"[00:53] fe008 | Oh , darn , can you can't see channel five yet ?"
"[00:55] me011 | Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth , so ."
[01:00] me028 | I like the high quality labelling .
"[01:00] me011 | S uh , try speaking loudly , so , OK , good . Thank you ."
"[01:02] fe008 | Hello , hello . Alright ."
"[01:03] me028 | David , can we borrow your labelling machine to improve the quality of the labelling a little bit here ?"
[01:09] me904 | Numbers from one to zero to X or something ?
"[01:12] me028 | @ @ How how many are there , one to five ?"
[01:12] me025 | One t
"[01:15] me028 | Yeah , please ."
"[01:17] me011 | Well , we don't wanna renumber them , cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them . So , let 's keep the same numbers on them ."
"[01:23] me025 | Yeah , OK , that 's a good idea ."
"[01:24] me011 | OK , Dan , are you on ?"
[01:25] me025 | I 'm on I 'm on two and I should be on .
[01:26] me011 | Good .
"[01:31] me011 | And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones , so I assume the various and assorted P Z Ms are on ."
[01:34] me028 | we ' r This is this this is a meeting meeting .
[01:40] me011 | Stuff .
"[01:42] me011 | Yeah , this is not something you need to attend . So ."
[01:45] fe008 | Yeah .
[01:48] fe008 | OK .
"[01:49] me022 | You 're always having one of those days , Dave ."
[01:49] fe008 | Y you 'd be welcome . You 'd be welcome .
[01:57] me022 | It 's not neck mounted . It 's supposed to be h head mounted .
[02:02] me022 | Right .
"[02:02] me011 | Well , then put it on your head . What are you doing ?"
[02:02] me025 | I don't know .
"[02:05] fe008 | Why didn't I you were saying that but I could hear you really well on the on the transcription on the , uh , tape ."
[02:08] me025 | I I don't know .
"[02:08] me011 | Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head but they were complaining about it ."
[02:09] me022 | i
[02:11] me028 | Why ?
[02:12] me011 | Because it 's not it doesn't go over the ears .
[02:14] fe008 | It 's badly designed .
[02:16] me028 | What do you mean it doesn't go over the ears ?
"[02:20] me011 | Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable ."
"[02:25] me022 | Yeah , that 's that 's what I have ."
"[02:25] me025 | Oh , that 's strange ."
[02:28] me022 | It feels so good when I stop .
[02:31] fe008 | Try it .
[02:32] me011 | So I I again would like to do some digits . Um .
[02:34] me028 | Somebody wanna close the door ?
[02:36] me011 | Sure .
[02:40] me022 | You 're always doing digits .
[02:45] me011 | digit - y g sorta guy .
[02:53] me011 | I doubt it .
[03:32] me011 | I think we 're session four by the way . Or m it might be five .
[03:38] me011 | I didn't bring my previous thing .
"[03:40] fe008 | Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ?"
[03:42] me025 | That 's the microphone number .
"[03:44] me011 | Yeah , d leave the channel blank ."
"[03:45] fe008 | OK , good ."
"[03:48] me028 | But number has to be ? So we have to look up the number . OK , good ."
[04:48] fe008 | Um .
[04:49] fe008 | I just start ? Do I need to say anything more ?
[06:37] me028 | This is Beck on mike four .
[07:19] me011 | Thanks . Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ? Do you think that makes any difference ?
"[07:22] me025 | Oh , God . No , let me do it ."
"[07:24] me011 | Why ? Are you gonna do something other than hit "" quit "" ?"
"[07:28] me025 | No , but I 'm gonna look at the uh , logs as well ."
[07:31] me011 | Oh .
"[07:34] fe008 | Uh , you said turn off the what ?"
[07:34] me011 | Should have done it before .
[07:38] fe008 | Oh .
[07:43] me011 | recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors .
"[07:47] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
"[07:47] me028 | Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ?"
[07:48] fe008 | I See .
"[07:50] me028 | Oh , I 'm sorry y"
"[07:53] me011 | Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug ."
[07:57] me011 | Right ? Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded .
[07:59] me011 | No chance of that . Just because it 's beta .
"[08:02] me025 | Yeah , there there there was there was a there was a bug . There was a glitch last time we ran ."
[08:02] me011 | Look OK ?
[08:10] me025 | No .
"[08:11] me011 | Yeah , we usually do that ."
[08:16] me028 | Why not ?
"[08:16] me025 | But we we ought to st we ought to standardize . I think , uh , I s I spoke to"
"[08:20] me025 | somebody , Morgan , about that ."
[08:21] me028 | Why don't you just do this ?
"[08:23] me011 | I mean , that 's what we 've done before ."
[08:26] me028 | Four .
"[08:28] me025 | Three ,"
[08:28] me028 | Three .
"[08:29] me025 | two , and one . But I think I think we should put them in standard positions . I think we should make little marks on the table top ."
"[08:36] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
"[08:36] me011 | Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things ."
[08:41] me025 | I guess that 's the point . It 'll be a lot easier if we have a if we have them permanently in place or something like that .
[08:46] fe008 | I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling .
[08:49] me025 | You do ?
[08:51] me022 | Would it make you feel more important ?
"[08:52] fe008 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . You know ."
[08:53] me022 | I see .
[08:53] me028 | Wait till the projector gets installed .
[08:55] me011 | That 'll work .
"[08:55] fe008 | Oh , that 'll be good . OK ."
"[08:56] me025 | Oh , gosh ."
"[08:56] me028 | Cuz it 's gonna hang down , make noise ."
[08:58] me025 | When 's it gonna be installed ?
[09:01] me025 | I see .
[09:10] me025 | OK . Cool .
[09:11] me028 | I handed it off to her about a month ago .
[09:13] me025 | I see .
"[09:15] me011 | OK , so ,"
[09:16] me011 | topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription .
[09:42] me011 | how we 're gonna handle some of these factors .
[09:45] me025 | Distribute what ? The data ?
[09:47] me011 | Hmm ?
[09:49] me011 | Right .
"[09:54] me011 | I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before ."
[09:59] me025 | Oh .
"[10:01] me028 | u Using , like , audio D V Ds or something like that ?"
[10:04] me011 | Excuse me ?
[10:05] me028 | Audio D V Ds ?
"[10:06] me011 | Well , or something ."
"[10:07] me011 | Yeah , audio D V Ds , C Ds ,"
[10:09] me028 | Or t
[10:11] me028 | tapes .
[10:17] me011 | how do we just do all that infrastructure ?
"[10:19] me022 | Well , I think I mean , for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance ."
"[10:28] me011 | Right , but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC and what does that mean to what we 've done already ?"
[10:34] me025 | It 's not so much the actu The logistics of distribution are secondary to preparing the data in a suitable form for distribution .
[10:41] me022 | Right .
"[10:43] me011 | Right . So , uh ,"
"[10:44] me011 | as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up , which we may wanna make a little more formal ."
"[10:52] me025 | And the other thing is that , um ,"
"[10:56] me025 | University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well , in which case"
[10:59] me011 | Right .
[11:01] me025 | w w we 'll have to decide what we 've actually got so that we can
[11:04] me025 | give them a copy .
[11:05] me028 | A field trip .
[11:06] me011 | That 's right .
"[11:11] me025 | Oh , really ?"
[11:13] me025 | Different for you . Yes .
[11:13] me011 | Visit my friends and
"[11:16] me011 | spend some time Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits ."
"[11:19] me011 | So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are ."
[11:30] me028 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:36] me011 | um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard ."
"[11:40] me011 | You know , STM files , or XML , or something ."
[11:41] me028 | An - and there 's interest up there ?
[11:42] me011 | What 's that ?
[11:42] me028 | There 's interest up there ?
[11:44] me011 | Well they they certainly wanna collect more data .
[11:49] me025 | I don't know .
[12:05] me025 | I see .
[12:07] me011 | And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room .
[12:10] me022 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:11] me011 | I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well , the the acoustics of this room ."
[12:18] me028 | Including the fan . Did you notice the fan difference ?
[12:18] me025 | All about that .
[12:23] me028 | Hear the difference ?
"[12:24] fe008 | Oh , that 's better ."
"[12:24] me025 | Yeah , it 's great ."
"[12:24] me011 | Oh , it 's enormous ."
[12:25] fe008 | That 's better .
[12:27] me011 | All the others have been on .
"[12:29] me028 | Yeah , the You sure ?"
"[12:30] me025 | Oh , yeah . Absolutely ."
[12:31] me028 | things after the f then
[12:31] me011 | Yeah .
"[12:34] me028 | Uh , I think this is high speed here ."
"[12:37] fe008 | Yeah , it 's noticeable ."
"[12:39] me028 | Well , not clear . Maybe it Maybe it isn't ."
[12:47] me028 | whether the lights made any noise .
[12:51] me011 | There 's definitely Yep . High pitch hum . Wow .
"[12:51] me022 | Yeah , a little bit ."
[12:56] fe008 | I think
[12:57] fe008 | candles would be nice if they don't make noise .
"[12:59] me025 | Oh , yeah ."
[12:59] me011 | They 're very good .
[13:02] me011 | Carbon monoxide poisoning ?
"[13:06] me028 | Yeah , sort of r r"
[13:07] me022 | got to finish this meeting .
[13:09] me022 | That 's right .
"[13:11] me028 | Actually , the a th air the air conditioning 's still working , that 's just an auxiliary fan ."
"[13:14] me022 | Right , I see ."
"[13:16] me022 | So , um , in addition to this issue about the UW stuff there was announced today , uh , via the LDC , um , a corpus from I believe Santa Barbara ."
[13:16] me011 | So -
"[13:26] fe008 | Yeah , I saw it . I 've been watching for that corpus ."
"[13:28] me022 | Um , of general spoken"
[13:29] fe008 | Yeah .
[13:31] me022 | English .
[13:38] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[13:38] fe008 | They had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have DAT recorders .
[13:42] me022 | I see . So it is sort of far field stuff .
[13:46] me022 | Right ?
"[13:50] fe008 | close field later on but , um , I 've listened to some of those data and I , um , I 've been I I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up ."
"[13:59] me022 | Oh , OK ."
[14:00] fe008 | I 'm glad to see that it got released . So it it 's a very nice thing .
[14:00] me025 | What 's it sound like ?
[14:03] me011 | I wish we had someone here working on adaptation because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting .
"[14:13] me011 | No , software , to adapt the speech recognition ."
[14:15] fe008 | OK .
"[14:17] me022 | Well , what I was thinking is it may be useful in"
"[14:20] me022 | transcribing , if it 's far field stuff , right ?"
[14:22] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:27] me022 | speech recognition models , it may be useful to have that kind of data because that 's very different than any kind of data that we have so far ."
[14:33] me011 | That 's true .
"[14:36] me011 | Well that 's not good , right ?"
[14:37] me022 | That 's that 's not great .
[14:37] me028 | Tr -
[14:42] me011 | Just these .
[14:42] me028 | Not head mounted ?
[14:43] me025 | Yeah .
"[14:43] me028 | And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something , or are they using multiple DATs ?"
"[14:47] fe008 | Um , oh , good question and I can't ans answer it . I don't know ."
[14:50] me011 | Well we can look into it .
"[14:50] me022 | No , and their web their web page didn't answer it either . So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them . So it 's that 's sort of a beside - the - point point . But ."
[14:52] fe008 | OK .
"[14:58] me011 | So we can get that just with , uh , media costs , is that right ?"
[14:59] me028 | Still a point .
[15:00] me022 | Right .
"[15:02] me022 | Uh , in fact we get it for free cuz they 're distributing it through the LDC ."
[15:04] me011 | Oh .
[15:05] me011 | Great .
[15:05] fe008 | Yep .
"[15:07] me011 | So that would be yeah , that would be something to look into ."
[15:09] me011 | So .
"[15:16] me011 | Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it , so maybe we need to"
[15:20] me011 | think about it a little bit .
[15:21] me022 | Huh .
[15:29] me022 | Yeah . Maybe we should maybe we should get a copy of it just to see what they did so so that we can we can compare .
"[15:32] me025 | Yeah , absolutely ."
[15:33] fe008 | It 's very nice .
[15:33] me011 | Yeah .
[15:35] me025 | Absolutely .
"[15:35] me011 | OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ?"
"[15:36] me022 | Alright , I 'll do that ."
[15:41] me022 | I can't remember the name of the corpus . It 's Corps -
[15:42] fe008 | CSAE . Corpus of Spoken American English .
"[15:44] me022 | S Right , OK ."
[15:54] me025 | Uh - huh .
[15:54] fe008 | this is clever .
[15:55] me022 | Apparently this was like phase one and the there 's still more that they 're gonna do apparently or something like that unless of course they have funding issues and then
[15:56] fe008 | Got it through the LDC .
[16:01] fe008 | Great .
[16:02] fe008 | Great .
[16:04] me022 | then it ma they may not do phase two but
[16:10] fe008 | Super .
[16:18] me022 | OK .
[16:29] me011 | Right .
[16:30] me022 | So when she gets here maybe that might be a good thing for her .
"[16:32] me011 | Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz ,"
[16:36] me011 | to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked .
[16:43] fe008 | OK .
"[16:48] me025 | Sure , of course ."
[16:48] me028 | That would be a meeting meeting meeting ?
[16:51] me022 | Yeah .
[16:54] me022 | Oh .
[16:55] me022 | Right .
[16:55] me011 | Um .
"[16:56] me022 | But maybe we should , uh find some day that Liz uh , Liz and Andreas seem to be around more often ."
[16:59] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:03] me022 | and Morgan 's gonna be here , and we can meet , at least this subgroup . I mean , not necessarily have the U - dub people down ."
[17:14] me022 | We need we need to talk to them some more .
"[17:15] me011 | you know , say "" this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription "" , if nothing else ."
[17:19] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:19] me011 | So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ? OK , so since that 's what we 're talking about ."
[17:21] me022 | Yeah .
[17:22] me025 | Let 's .
"[17:25] me011 | What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called "" Transcriber "" that seems to work very well ."
"[17:32] me011 | Um ,"
"[17:33] me011 | so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface and , uh ,"
[17:38] me028 | Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ?
[17:41] me011 | Right .
"[17:43] me011 | Yes , yeah ."
[17:44] me028 | the STP stuff .
"[17:46] me011 | Right , right . So we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level . So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time ,"
"[17:54] me011 | and then write down what was said within it , and identify the speaker ."
"[18:05] me011 | But other people are interested in for example stress marking . And so Jane is doing primary stress ,"
[18:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[18:43] fe008 | y y you 'll have different
"[18:45] fe008 | prosodic aspects . And then also if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're like what I just did , then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of"
[18:46] me025 | Hmm .
"[19:03] fe008 | and sometimes or of it 's in the middle . Anyway , so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs which isn't"
"[19:09] fe008 | uh ,"
[19:10] fe008 | very time - consuming .
[19:12] me028 | I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ? Or is it real is that what we 're talking about here ?
"[19:16] me011 | Well , that 's part of the thing we 're talking about . So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth ,"
[19:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:25] fe008 | As a pilot study . Yeah , as a pilot study ."
[19:26] me011 | Yeah .
"[19:29] me011 | Ten times about , is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take ,"
[19:42] me011 | So .
"[19:52] me011 | R right , so so one one option is to get"
[19:55] me011 | linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it . And apparently that 's happened in the past . And I think that 's probably the right way to do it .
"[20:02] me011 | Um , it will require a post pass , I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly ,"
"[20:23] me011 | But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money and , uh ,"
[20:25] me028 | Right .
"[20:30] me025 | Oh , really ."
"[20:31] me011 | I meant Joy . And so again , I have to say "" are we recording "" and then say , uh , Morgan has has consistently"
[20:37] me011 | resisted telling me how much money we have .
[20:40] me011 | So .
[20:44] me028 | Right .
"[20:47] me011 | I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves ."
[20:50] me011 | Right ?
[20:52] me011 | N right .
"[20:55] fe008 | There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks ,"
"[21:05] fe008 | to um ,"
[21:05] me011 | Right .
[21:06] fe008 | to do it in exchange .
[21:15] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[21:15] me025 | Yeah .
[21:17] me011 | Right .
[21:17] me025 | Right .
[21:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[21:22] me025 | Yeah .
"[21:23] me011 | So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students , at is that right ? Talking to people about that ?"
[21:40] me011 | She 's already done quite a bit . Yeah .
"[21:41] me028 | Oh , we have . I 'm sorry ."
"[21:41] fe008 | a bunch of hours , yeah ."
[21:42] me028 | So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ?
[21:45] me028 | Or is that really just a guess ?
[21:49] me022 | How fast are you ?
[21:52] me028 | Yeah i
[21:57] me025 | Mmm .
[21:57] me022 | Right .
"[22:09] fe008 | uh , transcribe it the most quickly . Cuz then , you know , you get like if you get a span of five words , that 's easy ."
[22:11] me025 | Yeah .
[22:14] me025 | Yeah .
[22:23] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[22:34] me028 | D does uh this tool you 're using is strictly it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ?
[22:34] me025 | Yeah .
[22:38] me011 | No .
"[22:38] fe008 | No , it doesn't but what a super tool . It 's a great environment ."
[22:44] fe008 | That 's an interesting idea . Hey !
[22:45] me011 | We 've we 've thought about doing that but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous .
"[22:51] me028 | Well , a couple things . First of all the time marking you 'd get you could get"
[22:52] me025 | Wow .
"[22:54] me028 | by a tool . And so if the if if the issue really uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts . You know , yo"
[22:55] me025 | That 's true .
[22:55] fe008 | That 's interesting .
[23:01] me011 | Most of those are done by a person .
"[23:02] fe008 | Yeah , I"
[23:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[23:10] me011 | Yeah .
"[23:14] me022 | Well , I mean , but sometimes it 's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right I mean , it depends on the error rate , right ?"
[23:15] fe008 | That 'd be fun .
[23:25] me022 | But we don't care about the timing of the words .
[23:27] me028 | Well I thought you just that 's said that was a critical issue .
"[23:28] me011 | We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances ."
[23:29] me022 | We cut it s s
[23:31] fe008 | boundary .
[23:43] me025 | we 're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is .
"[23:47] me011 | more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases ,"
[23:49] me025 | Yeah .
[23:50] me011 | continuous phrases .
[24:01] me011 | Um .
[24:01] me025 | Yeah .
[24:11] fe008 | i t pre - marked cuz it does take time to put those markings in .
[24:14] me025 | Yeah .
"[24:25] fe008 | and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary ."
[24:33] me025 | Yeah .
"[24:43] me028 | Those delays adjustable ? See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay ,"
[24:49] me025 | Yeah .
[24:50] fe008 | Yeah .
[24:54] me025 | It could do that couldn't it .
"[24:55] me011 | We could program that pretty easily , couldn't we Dan ?"
"[24:57] me011 | Yeah , mis Mister TCL ?"
[24:57] me025 | Yeah .
"[24:57] fe008 | Oh , interesting point . Ah ! Interesting point . OK , that would make a difference ."
"[24:58] me025 | I would have thought so , yeah ."
[25:01] me025 | Mmm .
"[25:03] fe008 | I mean , it 's not bad but it does take twice ."
"[25:04] me011 | But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID ."
"[25:07] me011 | I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change ."
[25:10] me025 | But we 've got we 've got the most channel data . We 'd have to do it from your signal .
"[25:15] fe008 | Oh , good point ! Ah ! We 've got volume ."
"[25:15] me025 | I mean ,"
[25:16] me025 | we 've we 've got we 've got a lot of data .
"[25:19] me011 | Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it ."
"[25:30] me011 | We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools ,"
[25:35] me011 | and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway .
[25:44] me028 | Put put it on your sweater .
[25:59] me025 | a week 's work to get to do something like this . So forty or fifty hours .
[26:05] me022 | Right .
[26:11] me025 | Sure .
[26:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[26:24] me022 | So
[26:25] me022 | maybe maybe we could try the following experiment . Take the data that you 've already transcribed
[26:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[26:31] me028 | Is this already in the past or already in the future ?
[26:34] me028 | You 've already you 've already done some ?
[26:35] fe008 | Yes I have .
[26:35] me011 | She 's she 's done about half a meeting .
"[26:36] me028 | Oh - Oh , I see . OK , good ."
[26:37] me022 | Right . Right . I 'm go
[26:38] me011 | Right ? About half ?
"[26:39] fe008 | S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much but anyway , enough to work with ."
"[26:40] me022 | Right . Um ,"
[26:41] me025 | Several minutes .
"[26:43] me022 | and and throw out the words , but keep the time markings ."
"[26:46] me022 | And then go through I mean , and go through and and try and re - transcribe it ,"
[26:46] fe008 | OK .
[26:48] fe008 | Good idea .
[26:50] me022 | given that we had perfect boundary detection . And see if it see if it see if it feels easier to you .
[26:54] fe008 | OK .
"[26:57] fe008 | Yeah , that 's what I was thinking . I 'd I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect ."
"[26:59] me022 | Yeah , I mean uh , that 's part of the problem is , is that what we really need is somebody else to come along ."
[27:23] fe008 | Exactly .
[27:24] me025 | Yeah .
[27:24] fe008 | Yeah .
[27:25] me028 | And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time .
[27:28] me022 | Right .
[27:34] me025 | Yeah .
[27:42] fe008 | a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting .
[27:45] fe008 | Could use it on the next segment of the text .
[27:46] me025 | The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from ?
[27:50] me022 | Right .
[27:50] me025 | Or the boundaries .
"[27:51] me011 | Yeah , one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to I mean that 's easy enough . I could do that ."
"[27:55] fe008 | Oh , I see what you mean ."
[28:00] me025 | That would be the automatic boundaries .
"[28:00] me022 | No , no , no , no . You wanna know given Given a perfect human segmentation , I mean , you wanna know how well I mean , the the question is , is it worth giving you the segmentation ?"
"[28:00] me011 | No , no ."
[28:04] fe008 | Yeah .
"[28:09] fe008 | Oh , I see what you mean . Yeah ."
"[28:10] me011 | I mean , that that 's easy enough . I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words ,"
[28:10] me022 | Right .
[28:15] me011 | and time yourself on it . So .
[28:17] me011 | Yep .
[28:17] fe008 | I see .
[28:18] fe008 | OK .
[28:18] me011 | So it that might be worth doing .
[28:20] fe008 | That 's good . I like that .
"[28:21] me011 | That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations ."
[28:27] me022 | Right .
"[28:33] me028 | UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there ."
[28:38] me011 | Right .
"[28:39] fe008 | And the other thing too is with with speaker identification , if if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big"
[28:45] fe008 | deal .
[28:48] me022 | Right .
[28:50] me011 | Yep .
"[28:50] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[28:52] me022 | I mean , there 's gonna there 's gonna be in the meeting , like the reading group meeting that we had the other day , that 's it 's gonna be a bit of a problem because ,"
[28:53] me025 | OK .
"[28:58] me022 | like , I wasn't wearing a microphone f and there were other people that weren't wearing microphones ."
[29:00] me025 | Yes .
"[29:02] me028 | But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ?"
[29:03] me025 | Right .
[29:03] me011 | That 'll s
[29:05] me011 | it might save ninety percent of the work though .
"[29:07] me022 | but , yes ."
[29:07] me011 | So .
[29:18] me025 | the
"[29:19] me025 | phrase marks , and the speaker , and speaker identity without putting in the words ."
"[29:23] me011 | Yeah . I 've already become pretty familiar with the format , so it would be easy ."
[29:24] fe008 | That 'd be so great .
[29:26] fe008 | Yeah . Yeah .
[29:26] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:28] me011 | If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ?"
"[29:28] fe008 | the part of work already completed on this ,"
"[29:31] fe008 | did we ? I mean , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions ,"
[29:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:41] fe008 | So , I when I i the it 's quickest for me in terms of"
"[29:52] fe008 | to just say , "" A colon "" ,"
"[29:56] fe008 | and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID ."
[30:09] fe008 | If that 's clear .
"[30:09] me011 | It 's pretty cute . But at any rate . So , um ,"
[30:10] me022 | OK .
[30:12] fe008 | It 's Perl script .
[30:14] me011 | Right . So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard .
[30:19] me011 | Everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription .
[30:19] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[30:22] fe008 | Yeah .
[30:22] me028 | Using wh using stone age
[30:24] fe008 | That 's right .
[30:26] me011 | Using using stone age tools .
[30:37] me011 | But it 's gonna be horrible . They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this .
"[30:40] fe008 | What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ?"
[30:40] me028 | Right .
[30:40] me025 | No .
"[30:44] me011 | Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price . They want you to call and and talk . So for other services ,"
"[30:50] me011 | um , they were about thirty dollars an hour ."
[30:53] fe008 | Of of tape ?
[30:54] fe008 | Or of action ? OK .
"[30:54] me011 | Thirty So , yeah . For thirty dollars an hour for of their work ."
"[30:58] fe008 | OK . Oh , of their Oh !"
[30:59] me011 | So so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour .
[30:59] me022 | So that 's three that 's three hours .
[31:03] fe008 | OK .
[31:07] me011 | No .
"[31:08] me028 | Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it ."
[31:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[31:13] fe008 | Interesting .
"[31:13] me011 | Yeah , so so my my search was pretty cursory . It was just a net search ."
"[31:18] me011 | And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff"
[31:22] me011 | through that .
[31:28] me028 | that really this could be a big contribution we could make .
[31:42] me025 | Yeah .
"[31:51] me028 | our time , where "" our "" of course includes Dan , Dan and you guys . It doesn't include me at all . Uh ."
[32:04] me028 | Bec -
[32:05] me028 | Why ? Because they wanted a lot more detail ?
[32:07] me011 | Right .
[32:13] me028 | Only had two .
[32:14] me011 | They had two speakers over the telephone .
"[32:15] me028 | Oh , I see . So what took them so long ?"
"[32:18] me011 | Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time . So they were doing phone and syllable"
[32:20] me025 | Yeah .
"[32:24] me011 | transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription ."
[32:24] me028 | Right .
[32:25] me028 | Right .
[32:26] me022 | Right .
[32:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[32:27] me011 | And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that .
[32:30] me028 | I see .
"[32:32] me028 | But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle ."
[32:34] me011 | Yep .
[32:34] me025 | Yeah .
[32:39] me011 | Right . And so so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour .
[32:44] me011 | I think that 's the ball park . There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents . Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour .
[32:51] me022 | And who
[32:52] me022 | who knows if they 're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data ?
"[32:56] me025 | Yeah , they won't . They w they 'll refuse to do it . Yeah ."
[32:56] me011 | They won't . We 'll have to mix them .
[32:57] me022 | Right .
"[32:58] me025 | No , but I mean , they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material ."
"[33:02] me025 | That 's not what they 're d quoting for , right ?"
"[33:04] me011 | Yes , it is ."
[33:05] me025 | For quoting meetings ?
"[33:06] me011 | Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on . None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID ,"
[33:09] me025 | Wow .
[33:13] me025 | Yeah .
[33:13] me011 | or speaker change mark . They all just said transcription .
"[33:18] me025 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[33:19] me011 | Well , the the way it worked is it it was scaled . So what they had is ,"
[33:37] me025 | I see .
[33:39] me011 | about what they would do . It would probably be a little more because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking .
[33:39] me025 | Yeah .
[33:40] fe008 | Yeah .
[33:40] me025 | Right .
[33:44] me011 | So .
[34:03] fe008 | That 's very interesting .
[34:10] me028 | And
[34:13] fe008 | There you go .
[34:17] fe008 | We could have some telegraphic meetings . That might be interesting .
"[34:23] me011 | So . But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out ."
[34:28] me028 | And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ?
[34:30] me011 | Thirty or forty .
[34:31] me028 | So thirty or forty thousand dollars .
"[34:34] me025 | Well , for ten thousand dollars ."
"[34:39] me028 | Oh , I 'm sorry , three hundred . Right , I w got an extra factor of three there . Yeah ."
"[34:41] me022 | So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? But we can pay a graduate student"
[34:45] me022 | seven dollars an hour . And the question is what 's the difference or ei eight dollars . What do you know what the going rate is ? It 's it 's on the order of eight to ten .
[34:48] me025 | How how much lower are they ?
[34:53] fe008 | I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate .
[34:54] me022 | I think .
[34:56] me022 | But I 'm not sure .
"[34:56] fe008 | I 'd I 'd say yeah , I was gonna say eight you 'd say ten ?"
[34:57] me025 | Ten .
[34:58] me022 | Let 's say ten .
"[34:59] me025 | Yeah , give them a break ."
[35:00] me022 | Cuz it 's easier .
"[35:02] me011 | Right , these are linguistics grad students ."
"[35:03] me022 | Yeah , I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard but there is a standard pay scale I just don't know what it is ."
"[35:07] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right . That 's right ."
"[35:08] me022 | Um ,"
[35:15] me022 | to do graduate students .
"[35:16] me011 | I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper ."
"[35:19] me025 | No , it isn't . So ."
"[35:23] fe008 | you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time ."
[35:32] me011 | And also we would have control
"[35:33] me011 | of I mean , we could give them feedback . Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount ."
[35:37] fe008 | Mmm . Good point .
"[35:38] me025 | Yep , yep ."
[35:41] me025 | Yep .
[35:44] me025 | No .
[35:45] fe008 | Good point .
"[35:45] me011 | And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress , they 're not gonna re provide repairs , they 're not gonna"
[35:57] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[35:57] me025 | Yeah .
[35:57] me028 | Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students . I who who 's the person in charge ? Who 's gonna be the Steve here ? You ?
[36:06] me011 | I hope it 's Jane . Is that alright ?
"[36:06] fe008 | Oh , interesting ."
"[36:08] fe008 | Um , now would this involve some manner of"
"[36:11] fe008 | uh , monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ?"
"[36:16] me011 | Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it ."
"[36:20] me025 | Yeah , out of out of Adam 's pocket ."
[36:20] me022 | Yeah .
[36:21] fe008 | OK .
"[36:28] me011 | Well , I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do , but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor ."
[36:31] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[36:35] fe008 | We 'll see .
[36:37] fe008 | OK .
[36:37] me025 | Yeah .
[36:38] me022 | Right .
[36:41] fe008 | Yeah .
"[36:47] me025 | Yeah , that 's right . Yeah ."
"[36:55] fe008 | Yeah , no , that I I would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that more . Yeah . Uh - huh ."
"[37:07] me011 | Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ?"
[37:12] me025 | What s so what are you so you 've done some portion of the first meeting . And what 's your plan ? To carry on doing it ?
[37:14] fe008 | Yes . Mm - hmm .
[37:24] me025 | OK .
[37:32] me025 | what do they cover ?
"[37:33] fe008 | They 're very minimal . So , it would be good to just to summarize that . So , um , one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change ,"
[37:39] me025 | Yeah .
"[37:40] fe008 | and this is a way which meshes well with with , uh , making it"
[37:42] me025 | Yeah .
"[37:57] fe008 | And then at the same time the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing . You can clip click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you ."
[38:09] me028 | Is there a limit to the number of speakers ?
"[38:10] me011 | Um , the user interface only allows two ."
[38:13] me025 | Hmm .
[38:13] me011 | And so if if you 're
[38:15] me011 | using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two . But my script can handle any . And their save format can handle any .
"[38:24] me011 | And so , um , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want ."
"[38:30] me028 | Do y is this a , uh , university project ?"
"[38:32] me028 | Th - this is the French software , right ?"
"[38:33] me025 | Yeah . Yeah , yeah , their academic ."
"[38:33] me011 | Yeah , French . Yeah . And they 're they 've been quite responsive . I 've been exchanging emails on various issues ."
[38:35] me028 | eh
"[38:37] me025 | Oh , really ?"
[38:37] fe008 | Oh .
"[38:38] me028 | Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ?"
"[38:40] me011 | Yes , and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version ."
[38:40] me028 | Good .
[38:42] me028 | Good .
"[38:43] me022 | Oh , so multi multichannels ."
"[38:45] me011 | Multichannels was also Well , they said they wanted to do it but"
[38:49] me011 | that the code is really very
[38:51] me011 | organized around single channels . So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen .
[38:53] me022 | I see .
[38:55] me022 | OK .
[38:56] me028 | Do - do you know what they 're using it for ? Why 'd they develop it ? Are they linguists ?
[38:58] me011 | For this exact task ?
"[39:00] me028 | But I mean , are they are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ?"
[39:02] me011 | I think they 're linguists .
[39:03] fe008 | Hmm .
"[39:04] me022 | They 're they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process , the Linguistic Data Consortium ."
[39:13] me022 | but a apart from that . Yeah .
[39:15] me011 | It 's also All the source is available . So .
[39:18] me028 | Great .
[39:18] me011 | If you if you speak TCLTK .
[39:21] me028 | Mm - hmm .
[39:27] me028 | Good .
"[39:29] me011 | So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in ."
"[39:33] fe008 | Yeah , I do too ."
[39:34] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[39:38] me025 | Pre - lay .
"[39:45] fe008 | um , it 's it is useful to have , uh , a a break mark to se segment it ."
"[39:50] fe008 | But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the uh , the tabbed key to toggle"
"[40:00] fe008 | uh , that 's a nice feature . And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit ."
[40:10] me028 | Loop it ?
[40:19] me028 | audio people actually use of course . It 's something that wh
[40:33] fe008 | I see .
[40:40] me025 | Mmm .
[40:42] me025 | Mmm .
[40:42] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[40:43] me022 | Yeah .
[40:45] me028 | Mm - hmm .
[40:50] me028 | Ye - Yeah . Right .
"[40:51] fe008 | Yeah , I I agree . They they have several options . So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option . Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary ."
[40:51] me022 | Yeah .
[41:00] me011 | Hmm .
[41:01] me028 | Cool .
[41:02] me022 | Hmm .
"[41:06] me011 | Point , whatever ."
"[41:12] fe008 | within , and But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , uh , basically , uh , it 's strictly orthographic which means with some w"
"[41:21] fe008 | provisions for , uh ,"
"[41:23] fe008 | w uh , colloquial forms . So if a person said , "" cuz "" instead of "" because "" then I put a an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in in double ang angle brackets"
[41:26] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[41:32] fe008 | what the full lexical item would be . And this could be something that was handled by a table or something but I think
[41:44] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[41:45] me022 | Mm - hmm .
[41:45] me011 | Non - canonical .
"[41:45] fe008 | "" Gonna "" or "" wanna "" , you know , the same thing . And and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation ."
[41:53] me022 | How are you handling backchannels ?
[41:56] me011 | Comments .
"[41:57] fe008 | you know oh , yes , there was some in my view ,"
"[42:01] fe008 | when i when you 've got it densely overlapping ,"
"[42:04] fe008 | um ,"
[42:05] me022 | What do you mean by du
[42:07] fe008 | I didn't worry about s specific start times . I sort of thought that
"[42:10] fe008 | this is not gonna be easily processed anyway and maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said "" no "" , or , you know ,"
"[42:18] fe008 | uh , i "" immediate "" . And instead just sort of rendered "" within this time slot ,"
[42:18] me025 | Yeah .
[42:29] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[42:30] me022 | I see .
"[42:30] me011 | Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech , right ?"
[42:37] fe008 | Uh - huh . That happened very seldom .
"[42:40] me022 | Oh , cuz I was I was listening to Dan was agreeing a lot to things that you were saying as you were talking ."
[42:41] me028 | Uh - huh .
[42:43] me028 | Uh - huh .
"[42:45] fe008 | Oh , well , thank you Dan . Appreciate it . Well , if it if there was a word like "" right "" ,"
[42:45] me022 | So .
"[42:47] me011 | Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark ."
"[42:49] fe008 | you know , then I wou I would indicate that it happened within the same tem time frame but wouldn't say exactly when it happened ."
[42:54] me025 | Yeah .
[42:56] me022 | I see .
"[42:59] fe008 | A lot of overlapping , yeah ."
[43:00] me011 | Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end .
[43:00] me025 | Yeah .
[43:03] me025 | Yeah .
"[43:03] me011 | Huge amounts . Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things ."
[43:03] me025 | It was at the beginning .
[43:17] me011 | and but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting .
"[43:20] fe008 | Yeah , well that 's true . That 's another issue ."
[43:25] me022 | Yeah .
"[43:27] me011 | uh ,"
[43:28] me011 | to who who the person was speaking to .
[43:30] fe008 | Yeah . Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling because he was in the other room talking .
[43:31] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:35] me011 | Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that ."
[43:35] fe008 | Yeah .
[43:39] fe008 | That 's true .
[43:40] me022 | Right .
[43:42] fe008 | I know .
[43:47] me025 | You don't have to .
[43:54] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[43:54] fe008 | @ @
[43:54] me025 | Uh - huh .
[44:10] me028 | he he
"[44:13] fe008 | Uh , yeah , I know . Well , you 'll see . You can listen to it ."
"[44:22] fe008 | No , well , but you were you were asking off the wall questions ."
"[44:25] me011 | But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me ,"
[44:30] me011 | it it became OK . So .
[44:31] me025 | I see .
[44:32] me028 | So th
[44:32] fe008 | And that 's w that 's where I added comments . The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who but but this was unusual circum circumstance .
[44:32] me022 | Hmm .
"[44:47] fe008 | volume that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation . You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case ."
[44:52] me025 | No .
[45:02] me028 | Mm - hmm .
[45:07] me028 | Great .
[45:14] fe008 | con what was going on .
"[45:18] me022 | So , s"
"[45:19] me022 | I was just gonna ask , uh , so I just wanted to c sort of finish off the question I had about backchannels ,"
[45:24] fe008 | Yeah . OK . Yeah .
"[45:24] me022 | if that 's OK , which which was , so say somebody 's talking for a while and somebody goes "" mm - hmm "" in the middle of it , and and and what not ,"
[45:24] me025 | Mmm .
[45:31] me022 | does the
[45:33] me022 | conversation
[45:41] me022 | of this other speaker or does it does the fact that there 's a backchannel split
[45:49] me022 | the the it in two .
"[45:51] fe008 | OK , my my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity"
"[45:56] fe008 | and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying . Like I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible . So"
"[46:07] fe008 | uh , intonational contour , I I indicated it as ,"
[46:09] me022 | OK .
[46:13] fe008 | then I indicated it as a segment which contained
[46:18] me022 | OK .
"[46:18] me025 | But that 's but there 's only one there 's only one time boundary for both speakers , right ?"
"[46:25] me022 | I see , I see , OK ."
[46:26] fe008 | Yeah .
"[46:26] me028 | I think whenever we use these speech words we should always do the thing like you 're talking about , accent , @ @ @ @ ."
[46:40] fe008 | Yeah .
"[46:57] fe008 | And "" uh - huh "" ,"
[46:57] me025 | OK .
"[46:58] fe008 | you know , "" UHUH . "" I mean , like a s set of like five . But in any case I didn't mark those ."
[47:01] me022 | Mm - hmm .
[47:12] me011 | I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end . We should probably mark
[47:18] me011 | areas that have no speakers as no speaker .
"[47:22] fe008 | Yeah , that 's a fine idea ."
"[47:22] me011 | Then , so question mark colon is fine for that ."
[47:23] fe008 | That 's a fine idea .
"[47:25] fe008 | Yeah , OK . Yeah ."
"[47:25] me028 | Well , what 's that mean ? You mean re"
[47:25] me011 | Just say silence . No one 's talking .
[47:27] me028 | ye s Oh . Silence all around . Yep .
[47:29] me011 | Yep .
[47:30] me025 | We have to mark those ? Don't they d can't we just leave them unmarked ?
[47:30] fe008 | I d
"[47:33] fe008 | Well , you see , that 's possible too ."
"[47:33] me011 | Well , I wanna leave the marked I don't want them to be part of another utterance ."
[47:37] me025 | OK .
[47:37] me011 | So you just you need to have the boundary at the start and the end .
[47:38] me025 | Sure .
"[47:39] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Now that 's refinement that , uh , maybe it could be handled by"
"[47:48] me025 | it seems like the , uh , tran the transcription problem would be very different if we had these"
"[48:00] me025 | I mean , I don't know , actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels ."
"[48:11] me011 | It can read and write as many as you want , it 's just that it"
[48:14] me025 | But what if you wanna edit it ?
"[48:15] me025 | Right ? I mean , the point is we 're gonna generate this transcript with five five tracks in it ,"
"[48:20] me025 | but with no words . Someone 's gonna have to go in and type in the words . Um , and if there are five five people speaking at once ,"
"[48:32] me011 | the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention ."
[48:37] me025 | Yes .
[48:39] fe008 | Which allows five .
"[48:40] fe008 | And it can be m edited after the fact , can't it also ? But their but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route ,"
[48:42] me011 | Yes .
[48:47] me025 | Yeah .
[48:52] me025 | Right .
[48:53] fe008 | So . But .
[48:58] me011 | Right .
"[49:04] me011 | the the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers ."
[49:12] me028 | Right .
[49:12] me011 | multiple any more than two .
"[49:13] me028 | So your your script solves Doesn't it solve all our problems , cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this"
[49:15] me011 | Yep .
[49:17] me011 | Yep .
"[49:17] me028 | preprocessing uh , assuming it works ."
[49:19] me011 | Yep .
[49:20] fe008 | And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter . So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which worry who the speaker was .
[49:24] me011 | Yep .
[49:24] me028 | I see .
[49:25] me028 | Right .
[49:26] me028 | Good .
"[49:27] fe008 | And then , uh , let 's see what else ."
[49:30] fe008 | So sometimes a pers I uh in terms of like the continuity of thought
[49:38] fe008 | purpose for an utterance . And sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it but you wanna show that it 's continued
[49:45] fe008 | at a later point . So I have I have a convention of putting like a dash arrow
[49:49] fe008 | just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues . And then when it
"[49:53] fe008 | uh , catches"
"[49:55] fe008 | back up again then there 's an arrow dash , and then you have the opposite direction"
"[50:04] fe008 | you know , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance ,"
"[50:08] fe008 | and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde ,"
[50:18] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:22] fe008 | if a different speaker , uh ,"
"[50:23] fe008 | con continuation . But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought ."
[50:28] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:28] fe008 | And then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later ."
[50:33] fe008 | And that was like this person continued and you 'd be able to look for the continuation .
[50:34] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[50:38] me011 | So -
[50:41] me025 | that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers .
"[50:46] me025 | Like , if you If you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across a particular time boundary , you just need"
[50:59] me025 | more than one speaker and that and they sort of
[51:06] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[51:08] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[51:09] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[51:09] me022 | How often does that happen do you think ?
[51:11] me025 | Hopefully not very much .
"[51:13] fe008 | Yeah , I didn't use it very often ."
[51:13] me011 | Especially for meetings .
[51:15] me028 | It l ou
"[51:15] me011 | I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know , if you were trying to do a remembrance agent ."
"[51:29] me011 | uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter . But other people have other interests . So ."
[51:33] me025 | Sure .
[51:34] me025 | I know .
"[51:42] me025 | because it seemed like there was a difference . It 's something you wanted to indicate that it that I this was the end of the phrase , this was the end of"
[51:51] me025 | And I picked up with an ellipsis .
[51:53] fe008 | Excellent . Yeah . Yeah .
"[51:54] me025 | I didn't have the equal , not equal thing ."
"[51:56] fe008 | Well that 's you know , I mean I that 's why I didn't I didn't do it n I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and and re - ev and it didn't do I didn't do it in ten times the the time ."
"[52:01] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
[52:05] fe008 | Yeah .
"[52:06] me011 | Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ? Is that something you want to do , Dan ?"
[52:12] me025 | No . But it 's something @ @ that I feel
[52:13] me011 | No .
[52:14] me025 | we definitely ought to do .
[52:24] fe008 | OK .
[52:31] me028 | So thirty to one 's what you got ? So that 's a new upper limit ?
[52:32] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[52:34] me025 | Yeah .
[52:37] me011 | But I think for a first try that 's about right .
[52:39] me028 | That 's right . a
[52:41] me025 | It was actually it was quite it was a t
[52:43] me028 | It 'd b a a
[52:44] me025 | it w
[52:45] me011 | Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ?
[52:45] me025 | Yeah .
[52:47] me025 | No .
"[52:51] me022 | Is there Maybe we should s consider also , um , starting to build up a web site around"
[52:57] me022 | all of these things . I know .
[53:00] me011 | Dan 's sort of already started .
[53:11] me025 | Yeah .
"[53:27] fe008 | Oh , I don't think so ."
[53:27] me022 | Um . No . The r
[53:29] me022 | w What OK .
"[53:32] me022 | No . Alright , see here 's here 's here 's my thought behind it which is that ,"
[53:35] fe008 | Alright .
"[53:36] me022 | uh , the the stuff that you 've been describing ,"
"[53:39] me022 | Jane ,"
"[53:43] me022 | um , i is very interesting , and"
"[53:45] me022 | I I 'd like to be able to to pore through , you know , the the types of tr conventions that you 've come up with and stuff like that . So I would like to see that kind of stuff on the web ."
"[53:49] me025 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[53:53] fe008 | OK , now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech ."
[53:55] me025 | Yes .
[53:57] me025 | Yes .
[53:58] me022 | Either 's fine .
[54:00] fe008 | that I have on my account but it doesn't matter .
[54:01] me025 | We c
[54:02] me011 | We can do it all .
[54:04] fe008 | OK .
[54:05] fe008 | Web site 's nice .
[54:06] me025 | Yeah .
[54:06] fe008 | Then you have to t
[54:07] fe008 | you have to do an HT access .
[54:07] me028 | Web site 's what ?
[54:08] me025 | We could actually maybe we could use the TCL plug - in .
"[54:19] me028 | But he does such a good job of it . He should be allowed to to , you know ,"
[54:22] me028 | w do it .
[54:32] me025 | Alright . Let 's look at it anyway . So definitely we should we should have some kind of access to
[54:36] me022 | Yeah .
[54:37] me011 | And we have we have quite a disparate number of
[54:37] me025 | the data .
[54:44] me025 | Yes .
[54:46] me011 | Yep .
"[54:48] me025 | Well , yeah . Well so then th"
"[54:52] me025 | the other side is , yeah ."
"[54:52] me022 | Uh , right ."
"[54:56] me025 | Right , that 's the problem ."
[54:58] me028 | Why ? What what 's what 's the issue ?
[55:01] me025 | No one owns the project .
[55:03] me028 | No one what ?
[55:04] me025 | No one owns the project .
[55:07] me025 | No one wants to own the project .
[55:09] me022 | Right .
"[55:12] me025 | Well then you have to do the web site . You know , it 's like , it 's that simple ."
"[55:13] me028 | b but but but what are you what are you talking about for web site hacking ? You 're talking about writing HTML , right ?"
[55:18] me025 | Yeah .
"[55:18] me011 | Yeah , I I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that that is"
"[55:26] me028 | But , is it against the law to actually use a tool to help your job go easier ?"
[55:28] me011 | Absolutely .
[55:29] me011 | It 's it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool .
[55:31] me028 | You y
[55:32] me011 | I haven't found any tools that I like . It 's just as easy to use to edit the raw HTML as anything else .
[55:36] me028 | No kidding ?
[55:38] me011 | It 's obviously not true .
[55:42] me025 | Right . That 's true .
[55:45] me028 | I use something called Trellix .
"[55:47] fe008 | Oh , that 's right . I remember . Yeah ."
[55:49] fe008 | Which produces also site maps .
[55:50] me028 | it 's - it it 's very powerful .
"[55:50] me011 | Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to . But"
[55:57] me011 | most of the web sites I do aren't that complex .
"[56:00] fe008 | Well , would this be to document it also for outside people or mainly for in house use ?"
[56:01] me011 | But .
"[56:04] me022 | No , I think in"
[56:04] me011 | I think both .
[56:05] me022 | I think mostly internal .
[56:05] me011 | Mostly in house .
[56:05] me025 | That 's right .
[56:07] fe008 | OK .
"[56:07] me028 | Well , yeah , but what does internal mean ? I mean , you 're leaving ."
"[56:08] me025 | No , both ."
[56:13] me022 | Right . Internal to the project .
[56:14] me028 | I see .
[56:15] fe008 | We could do an HT access which would accommodate those things .
[56:22] me025 | I 'm not o
[56:22] fe008 | Wonderful .
[56:23] me025 | OK . I 'm not sure how how
[56:30] me022 | No . No .
[56:39] me025 | be coherent and make it a nice presentation .
[56:39] me028 | Right . I agree .
[56:42] me028 | Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later .
"[56:44] fe008 | That 's right . I mean , it 's the early on ."
[56:44] me025 | Yeah .
[56:45] me028 | Even if it 's just writing things up . You know ?
[56:47] fe008 | It 's a great idea .
"[56:49] me011 | OK , um , let 's move on to electronics ."
[56:51] me025 | Ah . Great .
[56:51] me028 | @ @ d we we out of tape out of disk ?
"[56:53] me025 | No , we 're doing we 're doing great ."
[57:05] me028 | right under th the
"[57:06] me011 | Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ? It 's great ."
"[57:07] me028 | the the the lip , yeah . There 's a lip in these tables ."
[57:25] me025 | What ? What ?
[57:29] fe008 | OK .
[57:29] me025 | I see .
"[57:33] me028 | I mean , the the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway . I 'll - I 'll show you the the cro this is the table cross section . I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at ."
[57:51] me011 | Get your paper off my PDA !
"[57:55] me028 | That 's right . "" Or not to be "" . Yeah , yeah ."
[58:28] me025 | Right . All the lights .
[58:34] me028 | would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these
"[58:39] me028 | cables at the same time . Uh , so this this notion of putting down the P Z Ms"
"[58:48] me011 | Right . Well , we wanna do that definitely . So ."
[58:49] me028 | Right .
[58:54] me025 | Velcro .
[59:01] me011 | Sleeve .
"[59:01] me028 | a p piece of yeah , that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the"
[59:06] me028 | wires into that 's sort of shaped like that cross section .
"[59:09] me011 | Oh . OK , not just sleeve them all ?"
[59:11] me025 | No .
[59:11] me011 | And leave them loose ?
[59:12] me025 | Yeah .
[59:16] me011 | Whoo ! Speed -
[59:16] me025 | Speed bump ! Speed bump .
"[59:18] me028 | Yeah , it 's like a speed bum An -"
[59:20] me028 | And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic . They sorta look like this .
[59:24] me011 | Oh .
[59:24] me022 | What does that mean ? Is it a speed bump ?
"[59:25] me025 | That 's the s that 's British for speed bump , yeah ."
[59:25] me028 | So that the wires go through here .
[59:28] me022 | Wow .
[59:29] me025 | Yeah .
[59:30] me028 | So .
[59:34] me028 | s
[59:35] me022 | It could go either way .
[59:36] me011 | So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ?
[59:37] me025 | Yeah .
[59:37] me022 | I guess .
[59:42] me025 | How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables ?
[59:43] me028 | Because they 're there .
"[59:44] me011 | Well , OK , let me rephrase that . Why two each ?"
"[59:47] me025 | Oh , because then you don't have to just have one each . So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box ."
[59:51] me028 | Yeah .
"[59:53] me028 | And to See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table ."
[59:55] me028 | Th -
[59:57] me011 | OK .
[59:58] me028 | Uh .
[00:01] fe008 | Which means two at each station .
[00:03] me028 | Well that that 's the way people sit . That 's how many chairs are in the room .
[00:04] fe008 | Yeah .
"[00:05] fe008 | Yeah , I 'm just saying that for the recording ."
[00:05] me011 | Alright .
[00:05] me028 | Yeah .
[00:06] me028 | Right .
[00:06] me011 | Right .
[00:10] me011 | OK .
[00:10] me028 | And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in .
[00:13] me028 | Uh if if you ha if you had nothing else . Yeah .
[00:14] me011 | But then none of these .
[00:14] me011 | Right . N none of these and no P Z Ms then .
[00:17] me028 | Right . Right . I agree .
"[00:18] me025 | Only if you had Well it depends on this box , right ?"
[00:25] me025 | Exactly .
"[00:26] me011 | Oh , I didn't understand Oh , I see , I see ."
[00:26] fe008 | That being the wiring box .
"[00:40] me028 | he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage ."
[00:46] me011 | in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ?
"[00:53] me028 | Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in ."
[00:53] me025 | Hmm !
"[01:00] me028 | And there 's a there 's a plug on the end of each of these these , uh , ei"
[01:01] me025 | Yeah .
[01:02] fe008 | Each of the blue wires ? Mm - hmm .
[01:03] me025 | But there are only four . Yeah .
[01:07] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[01:09] me025 | Yeah .
"[01:12] me011 | Oh , then it comes on . I see , I see . OK , good ."
"[01:13] me028 | Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this . So , we it 'll have to be convention ."
[01:23] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[01:32] me011 | Right .
"[01:34] me025 | Yeah , I mean , we I had that last time ."
"[01:36] me025 | But uh there are actually that you know , there 's an extra there 's a mix out on the radio receiver ?"
[01:40] me028 | Mm - hmm .
[01:50] me028 | How interesting . D did you do any recognition on the mix mix out ?
[01:51] fe008 | Hmm .
[01:53] me025 | No .
[01:54] me025 | But I subtracted the four that I did have from the mix and got a pretty good approximation of the @ @ . Yeah .
[01:58] me028 | Got the fifth ? Cool .
"[01:59] fe008 | Oh , how great ."
[02:00] me011 | And did it work ? Did it sound good ?
"[02:01] me025 | It 's not bad . It 's not bad , yeah ."
[02:02] me011 | Wow .
[02:02] fe008 | That 's amazing .
[02:03] me025 | Yeah .
[02:05] me011 | So what 's the schedule on these things ?
[02:06] fe008 | Wow .
"[02:07] me028 | Uh , well I was wrestling with th with literally the w"
"[02:13] me028 | the , uh ,"
[02:16] me028 | I was gonna do this very clever phantom power and I decided a couple days ago not to do it . So I 'm ready to build it .
[02:19] me025 | Hmm !
"[02:24] me011 | Mm - hmm . So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up so that it 's a little more presentable and organized ."
[02:26] me025 | See -
[02:32] me028 | I agree .
"[02:33] me011 | And I 'm I 'm just not sure what that is . I mean , some sort of cabinet ."
[02:42] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[03:11] me025 | Yeah .
"[03:11] me011 | Yeah , I understand . So ."
[03:21] me011 | Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ?
[03:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[03:33] me011 | And it 's total crap .
"[03:37] me011 | Right , Kleenex and telephones ."
[03:38] me028 | Right .
"[03:39] me011 | Um , so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ?"
"[03:45] me011 | OK , great ."
[03:48] me011 | Hmm ?
"[03:49] me028 | is security . I mean , we 've been been been lax and lucky ."
[03:50] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[03:51] me025 | Yeah .
[03:53] me025 | Yep .
"[03:59] me025 | Oh , yeah !"
"[04:00] me011 | I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer ."
"[04:03] me025 | Well w yeah , exactly . We 'll know we 'll know to come after ."
"[04:08] me011 | So , um , j uh ,"
[04:10] me011 | then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ?
[04:16] me025 | Sorry ?
"[04:18] me011 | A user interface . I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ?"
[04:22] me011 | Or just something .
[04:22] fe008 | Oh .
[04:24] me011 | And how do we want to do that ?
"[04:25] fe008 | You mean like see see meter readings , from while sitting here ."
[04:26] me011 | J just so we see something .
[04:28] fe008 | Wow .
[04:30] me025 | Yeah .
[04:31] me028 | use the thing that um
[04:34] me028 | ACIRI 's doing .
[04:37] me028 | laptop with a wireless .
"[04:38] me025 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . Sure ."
[04:39] fe008 | Oh .
"[04:40] me025 | Which we 'll borrow from them , when we need it ."
"[04:44] me025 | Oh , a Applecard . Sure . Right . Yeah , you could use my machine ."
[04:47] me028 | What ?
"[04:54] me011 | Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ?"
"[04:57] me025 | Uh , that 's an ethernet connection ."
[04:58] me028 | Yeah no no I 'm a
[05:00] me011 | We jus
[05:07] me025 | Yeah .
[05:09] me025 | And given given that we 've got a wireless that we 've got a we got the field . Right .
[05:14] me025 | Yeah . Yeah .
[05:15] me025 | I don't know .
"[05:15] me028 | Y I mean , we need obviously need to clear this with ACIRI but , uh ,"
"[05:19] me028 | how tough can that be ? There it you 'd all you need 's web access , isn't it ?"
"[05:23] me025 | W we don't need X access but I mean that 's fine . That 's that 's what it does , yeah ."
[05:23] me028 | In in theory .
"[05:25] me028 | OK , great , great ."
"[05:27] me011 | Um ,"
"[05:28] me011 | right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem ."
[05:30] me025 | With a with a with a w 1 x
[05:33] me025 | No .
"[05:35] me025 | Yeah . I do ! Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
"[05:40] me025 | No , I would love to but I 'm not sure if my laptop is compatible with the"
[05:44] me025 | wave LAN thing they 're using .
[05:46] me028 | Really ?
[05:47] me011 | To Mac .
[05:47] me028 | Your new one ?
"[05:47] me025 | Well Apple has their own thing , right ?"
[05:49] me028 | I 'm sorry ?
[05:49] me011 | Airport .
[05:52] me028 | I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port .
"[05:56] me025 | I think you I think it just plug plugs in a PC card , so you could probably make it run with that , but ."
"[06:00] me011 | The question is , is there an Apple driver ?"
[06:06] me028 | But the two t
[06:06] me025 | there are there are abs there are a bunch of machines at ICSI that have those cards and so I think
[06:11] me025 | if w if it doesn't we should be able to find a machine that does that .
[06:20] fe008 | Hmm . Hmm .
[06:22] me025 | Yeah .
[06:26] me025 | Yeah .
"[06:27] me028 | i is fairly straight forward . The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , "" oh , can I borrow your machine for a while "" , is is is a non - starter ."
[06:28] me025 | Yeah .
[06:32] me025 | Yeah .
[06:34] me028 | That I I don't think that 's gonna work .
[06:34] me025 | I see .
[06:39] me025 | Yeah .
"[06:39] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
[06:42] me025 | Absolutely .
[06:46] me025 | Yeah .
[06:46] me028 | e exactly for that purpose . Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time .
[06:51] me025 | Yeah .
[06:55] me011 | Right .
[06:58] me011 | Yeah .
[07:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[07:04] me011 | Right .
[07:04] me011 | I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM
"[07:08] me011 | VAIO Sony thingy , and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back ."
[07:09] me028 | Right .
[07:09] me025 | Yeah .
[07:12] me025 | You 're kidding !
[07:14] me011 | Sure .
[07:14] me028 | Yeah .
[07:15] me011 | But that does mean so we can use that as well .
[07:20] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:22] me028 | Uh , ask them what it costs . Ask them if they have an extra one . Who knows , they might have an extra hardware s"
[07:26] me025 | I 'd trade them a flat panel display for it . Yeah .
"[07:30] me022 | What is the , um , projector supposed to be hooked up to ?"
[07:56] me028 | It a
[07:58] me025 | Yeah .
[08:00] me028 | But but but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's that 's
[08:03] me028 | there in front of you is really cool .
"[08:03] me025 | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
[08:05] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:06] me025 | I think and uh , having having it on wireless is is the neatest way neatest way to do it ."
[08:07] me028 | R
[08:12] me025 | Yeah .
[08:13] me011 | I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the
"[08:16] me011 | cards to do wireless stuff and they said , "" sure , whenever you want "" . So I think it won't be a problem ."
[08:17] me025 | Yeah .
"[08:21] me025 | Oh , cool ."
"[08:22] me028 | And and it 's a a PCMCIA card , right ? PC card , so you can have a slot , right ? In your new machine ?"
[08:22] me025 | OK .
[08:24] me011 | Yep .
"[08:25] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
[08:27] me028 | Is it with s
[08:27] me022 | It 's it really come down to the driver .
[08:30] me025 | Yeah .
"[08:30] me011 | Right , I mean , and if and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC ."
[08:34] me028 | It 'll work the first time .
[08:36] me028 | I I trust Steve Jobs .
[08:39] me011 | Good .
"[08:40] me025 | Um , well , that sounds like a d good solution one way or the other ."
[08:44] me011 | So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ?
"[08:48] me028 | Uh , y yeah . We we need to"
[08:49] me011 | Great .
"[08:54] me028 | Hey , what are those green lights doing ?"
[08:56] me011 | They 're flashing !
[08:56] me025 | Uh - oh ! Uh - oh ! Does that it means it means it 's gonna explode . No .
"[09:04] me011 | When people talk , it they go on and off ."
"[09:08] me025 | So again , Washington wants to equip a system . Our system , we spent ten thousand dollars on equipment not including the PC ."
"[09:15] me025 | However , seven and a half thousand of that was the wireless mikes ."
[09:19] me028 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:25] me025 | Yeah , that 's true but we haven't spent that , right ?"
"[09:32] me025 | uh , we can just knock them out , right ? We can start we you can make a hundred of them or something ."
[09:32] me011 | Cheap .
"[09:34] me028 | Oh , of the of the boards ? Yeah , yeah , sure , right ."
[09:41] me028 | Mm - hmm .
[09:43] me028 | Peanuts .
[09:44] me011 | A PC and a peanuts .
[09:45] me025 | PC and two thousand dollars for the A - to - D stuff .
[09:47] me011 | Yeah .
[09:48] me025 | And that 's about cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the Oh th
[09:50] me028 | Right .
[09:59] me025 | might be attractive .
[10:01] me028 | Right .
"[10:03] me025 | OK , I can move my thumb now ."
[10:05] fe008 | That 's a great idea .
[10:07] fe008 | It 's nice it 's nice to be thinking toward that .
[10:13] me025 | Yeah .
"[10:14] me011 | There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this , cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits ."
[10:28] me025 | Yeah .
"[10:37] fe008 | Oh , interesting ."
[10:39] fe008 | And shorter words .
[10:40] me011 | Shorter words .
[10:50] me022 | Huh .
"[10:57] me011 | OK , can you do one more round of digits ? Are we done talking ?"
[11:08] me028 | Sure .
[11:09] me011 | Do we have more to talk about ?
"[11:09] me028 | No , I 'm done ."
[11:10] me022 | I 'm done .
[11:11] me011 | Are you done ?
"[11:12] fe008 | I 'm done , yeah ."
[11:12] me011 | I 'm done .
[11:14] me022 | Dan isn't but he 's not gonna say anything .
[11:22] me011 | I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time .
"[11:23] me028 | or or or or a little , uh you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist ."
[15:17] me011 | It 's harder at the end than at the beginning .
"[15:21] me028 | No , I know . I 'm just giving you a hard time ."
[15:23] me011 | It 's it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer . Me .
[15:24] me025 | Tha - tha
[15:26] fe008 | I also think you said channel four and I think you meant microphone four .
[15:37] me028 | And there shouldn't be a colon .
"[15:39] me028 | Because see , everything else is stuff you fill in ."
"[15:41] me025 | Yeah , that 's been filled in for you ."
[15:43] me028 | Right ? Automatically . But real
[15:52] me028 | Where 'd they come from ?
"[15:53] me025 | And they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are have the numbers in digits ."
[15:59] me025 | And so they 're actually this is like all the all utterances that were generated by speaker MPJ or something . And then within MPJ they 're sorted by what he actually said .
[16:05] me011 | Ugh ! I didn't know that . I should have randomized it .
"[16:08] me025 | It doesn't matter ! It 's like Cuz you said "" six , seven , eight "" ."
"[16:11] me028 | Well , we think it doesn't matter ."
"[16:14] fe008 | Oh , interesting ."
[16:27] me011 | we don't have to transcribe .
[16:38] me011 | Bet we could do it .
[16:43] me025 | Alright .
"[16:43] me011 | Actually , this I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora . So . We can compare directly ."
[16:50] me025 | Looks good . Looks like there were no errors .
[16:53] me011 | What ?
"[16:53] me025 | There were no there were no direct driver errors , by the look of it , which is good ."
"[16:55] me011 | Great . OK , the mike 's off . Thank you all ."
[16:55] fe008 | Good news .
"[16:57] me025 | So I 'm gonna stop it . Yeah , OK ."
[17:02] me025 | Uh - oh .

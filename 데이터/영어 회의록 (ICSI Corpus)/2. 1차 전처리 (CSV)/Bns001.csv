[00:03] mn035 | @ @
"[00:06] me011 | OK , so we should be on ."
[00:08] mn082 | So
[00:08] me011 | And I 'm gonna go ahead and
"[00:09] me011 | start by reading the digit strings ,"
[00:11] me011 | just to give you an example of how to do it .
[00:12] me011 | And so the first thing to do is read the transcript number
[00:15] me011 | which is on the right hand side there .
[00:48] me011 | And so if you could just go around the table
[00:51] me011 | and read them out .
"[00:51] fn083 | OK , should I next ?"
[00:52] me011 | Yep
[03:34] me011 | Thanks .
[04:56] me011 | Thanks
"[04:57] me011 | So , I wanted to just era it reiterate"
[04:59] me011 | cuz we did have have one person come in
"[05:00] me011 | a little later that , um"
[05:02] me011 | there will be an opportunity
[05:03] me011 | to remove anything from the transcript that you don't want made public
"[05:07] me011 | after it 's transcribed , so that 'll be some months off , but you will have that opportunity"
[05:11] me011 | OK ? Thanks .
[05:12] mn021 | OK .
[05:13] mn082 | OK . Thanks Adam .
[05:14] mn082 | We could start with our meeting ?
[05:16] me011 | Yep !
[05:16] mn082 | Yep !
[05:16] me011 | Thanks very much .
[05:17] mn082 | You have to stay all the time here ?
[05:18] me011 | I don't have to
[05:19] me011 | Um .
[05:19] mn082 | But ch you wanna do ?
"[05:21] me011 | At the end of the meeting ,"
[05:22] me011 | don't turn off the mikes
[05:24] me011 | just leave them on .
[05:25] mn021 | OK .
[05:25] me011 | And uh
[05:26] me011 | Uh .
[05:28] me011 | Actually
"[05:28] me011 | could y actually , could you call me ,"
[05:29] me011 | At the end of the meeting ? I 'll leave my number on the board there
[05:31] mn082 | Yeah . OK . We can do that .
[05:32] me011 | Thanks .
"[05:35] fn083 | Hey , Adam , you know what ? It must be funny to do an a"
[05:39] fn083 | behave while reading these numbers .
[05:41] me011 | Numbers are strange !
[05:43] me011 | It is !
[05:43] fn083 | Yeah !
[05:46] fn083 | to see their behavior .
[05:47] me011 | the the meetings are strange .
[05:49] fn083 | Oh y yeah !
[05:49] me011 | People interrupt each other much more than I thought they did .
[05:59] mn082 | Right .
[06:00] me011 | two nine seven seven .
[06:00] mn082 | OK . Yeah . I will call you then .
[06:01] mn021 | OK .
[06:02] me011 | Thanks .
"[06:03] mn082 | Uh , OK ."
[06:06] mn082 | our weekly meeting . The last time 's uh
"[06:08] mn082 | we learned too much , I believe , so"
"[06:11] mn082 | uh , today ,"
[06:12] mn082 | I have two topics .
"[06:14] mn082 | And the first topic ,"
"[06:16] mn082 | um , we have a new member in our group , Miguel Sanchez ."
[06:19] mn082 | I believe everybody
[06:20] mn021 | Hi .
[06:21] mn082 | knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here
[06:24] mn082 | quite a little time and I think he is talking to everybody in the meantime .
"[06:28] mn082 | So , but , anyway , I would like that Miguel Sanchez will introduce himself a little bit ,"
"[06:32] mn082 | concerning his background , what he intend to do ."
"[06:35] mn082 | And Because I discussing with him uh , uh"
"[06:38] mn082 | many things concerning , uh , his skills and"
[06:40] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[06:42] mn082 | what the NSA group intends to do .
"[06:45] mn082 | I hope there will be a match , uh , then , for his future work ."
[06:48] mn082 | And the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail .
[06:53] mn082 | I believe we still haven't left
[06:56] mn082 | our starting position .
"[06:58] mn082 | And , um , yesterday I also discussed with Wilbert"
[07:03] mn082 | some
"[07:08] mn082 | "" What problem we are"
"[07:10] mn082 | going to solve with such a proposal . "" Not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside ,"
"[07:18] mn082 | but , the technical problem ."
"[07:20] mn082 | But that 's under the s second topic , so first"
[07:22] mn082 | I would like that Miguel
[07:24] mn082 | will
[07:25] mn082 | told us a little bit about his skills and and uh
[07:27] mn021 | OK .
[07:28] mn082 | his background .
"[07:29] mn021 | OK , thank you Joe ."
"[07:30] mn082 | So , please ."
"[07:30] mn021 | Well ,"
"[07:31] mn021 | I , uh , as all of you know I came from from Spain , from the"
[07:36] mn021 | uh Polytechnic University of Valencia
"[07:39] mn021 | and i uh I um ,"
[07:41] mn021 | just finished my
[07:43] mn021 | PHD thesis
[07:44] mn021 | about uh um
[07:47] mn021 | power - saving techniques for wireless networking .
"[07:52] mn021 | uh , In fact , I have developed an"
[07:54] mn021 | algorithm
[07:55] mn021 | to control
[07:56] mn021 | the ra radio frequency power
[07:59] mn021 | uh of a wireless transceiver .
[08:04] mn021 | also
"[08:05] mn021 | in routing issues , especially"
[08:08] mn021 | in the so - called ad - hoc netw wireless networks .
[08:12] mn021 | Where
"[08:13] mn021 | uh , you have"
"[08:15] mn021 | a set of , uh , mobile nodes"
"[08:17] mn021 | and , no other"
"[08:19] mn021 | infrastructure ,"
[08:20] mn021 | no base stations .
[08:21] mn021 | So all the routing functions are done
[08:25] mn021 | by the same nodes .
"[08:27] mn021 | OK ? So , nodes act"
[08:29] mn021 | as both end points
[08:31] mn021 | and
[08:31] mn021 | routers .
[08:33] mn021 | eh
[08:34] mn021 | I 've in the study for some time
[08:37] mn021 | these kind of networks .
[08:42] mn021 | research uh
[08:43] mn021 | articles about this this kind of networks because
"[08:47] mn021 | You know , uh ,"
[08:48] mn021 | mmm
"[08:51] mn021 | network has been a long topic of research . So ,"
"[08:55] mn021 | for example , routing"
[08:56] mn021 | on on wired networks
[08:59] mn021 | a topic still to be researched but
[09:01] mn021 | it has an important background .
[09:03] mn021 | But
[09:03] mn021 | mobile network this kind of mobile networks
"[09:06] mn021 | is a little bit uh newer , especially because"
"[09:10] mn021 | uh , until not so long"
"[09:12] mn021 | uh , the the things were too heavy"
"[09:16] mn021 | to have a computer ,"
"[09:17] mn021 | a wireless transceiver ,"
[09:19] mn021 | on a more or less portable thing .
"[09:21] mn021 | So ,"
"[09:22] mn021 | with the advent of this new technology , low power"
"[09:25] mn021 | uh , high , uh , processing capability"
"[09:29] mn021 | and wireless eh networking capability , in a really small package ,"
[09:34] mn021 | new kind of devices are are being built and
"[09:36] mn021 | are appearing , in the market ."
"[09:39] mn021 | And , eh , well"
[09:40] mn021 | this is more or less what I have done .
[09:43] mn021 | And
"[09:44] mn021 | the kind of , uh , things , I 'm interested is"
[09:50] mn021 | these kind of networks .
[09:51] mn021 | But
"[09:52] mn021 | I could say , uh"
"[09:54] mn021 | in general ,"
"[09:55] mn021 | mobile service is not only about , uh"
[09:58] mn021 | these specific kind of networks .
"[10:00] mn021 | But , in general , about , uh"
[10:03] mn021 | services uh over
"[10:08] mn021 | uh , capability of nodes to move around ."
"[10:15] mn021 | I 've been teaching now for twelve years ,"
[10:18] mn021 | comp eh
"[10:18] mn021 | At a computer sciences school in my university ,"
[10:22] mn021 | I 've been teaching computer networks .
"[10:24] mn021 | And , well , I am more or less"
"[10:27] mn021 | uh , knowledgable about , well ,"
"[10:30] mn021 | TCP IP networking ,"
"[10:32] mn021 | ISO uh , networking ,"
"[10:35] mn021 | and , uh"
"[10:36] mn021 | well I 'm I 'm a computer guy , so"
[10:40] mn021 | um
"[10:41] mn021 | Well , I can say"
"[10:43] mn021 | uh , proudly"
"[10:44] mn021 | uh , more or less , computer skilled . I mean , uh , operating systems uh , programming languages"
"[10:50] mn021 | uh , networking @ @ . So this kind of things I think I 'm"
[10:54] mn021 | more or less well - trained .
[10:56] mn021 | So
"[10:57] mn021 | this is , I think , um ,"
[10:59] mn021 | my first presentation .
[11:01] mn021 | Next maybe next meeting
[11:03] mn021 | I will
"[11:04] mn021 | uh , do a small sketch about"
"[11:09] mn021 | well , presenting some det a little bit more detailed approach"
"[11:15] mn021 | and some things from previous talks ,"
[11:17] mn021 | so you can have a better idea of w the kind of work I 've been doing .
[11:22] mn021 | OK ?
[11:23] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[11:23] mn021 | Thank you .
"[11:23] mn082 | So , thanks , Miguel ."
[11:27] mn021 | Y
[11:28] mn082 | will have a talk next Tuesday
[11:29] mn021 | Yeah .
"[11:30] mn082 | But ,"
[11:31] mn082 | Give me a sign and send me an abstract
[11:32] mn021 | Yeah .
"[11:33] mn082 | so that I can announce it , then , for the next meeting ."
[11:35] mn021 | That 's OK .
[11:37] mn082 | Um . One short other topic is
[11:40] mn082 | Uh .
[11:42] mn082 | Claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime .
"[11:46] fn083 | Oh , OK ."
"[11:46] mn082 | And , despite"
[11:48] mn082 | busy stuff with waivers and uh
"[11:53] mn082 | uh , she found the time to"
"[11:56] mn082 | um write , with what we discussed before and"
[12:00] mn082 | in the form of HTML stuff . And
[12:04] mn082 | we wanna
[12:05] mn082 | put it on the web pages
[12:07] mn082 | in the next days .
"[12:09] mn082 | So , I will send an email , then , to everybody that they should"
[12:13] mn082 | check their web pages
"[12:14] mn082 | whether they 're aligned with , um ,"
[12:17] mn082 | their own views and opinions
[12:19] mn082 | of what we should what should be
"[12:22] mn082 | presented on the web pages . And any feedback is then , well appreciated ."
[12:26] mn021 | OK .
[12:27] mn082 | Let 's switch to the project proposal .
"[12:29] mn082 | Um , I mentioned that it is"
[12:32] mn082 | still
[12:32] mn082 | f
[12:32] fn083 | Ah . Sorry .
[12:33] fn083 | Can I ?
[12:34] fn083 | Maybe I can add something .
"[12:35] fn083 | Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site . So ,"
[12:39] fn083 | p
"[12:40] fn083 | For example , if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever , about the work you did before , what you are planning to do here ,"
[12:46] mn021 | OK .
"[12:46] fn083 | that would be fine , cuz now we can add some more stuff there ."
"[12:50] fn083 | Or if you have something or if somebody has some slides , o or articles , whatever he wants to be"
[12:56] mn082 | Yeah .
[13:00] fn083 | Yeah and
[13:01] mn082 | really structured . Then maybe you wi
[13:03] mn082 | can easy
"[13:04] mn082 | offer some additional input which should be presented , then , on the web pages ."
"[13:07] fn083 | Yeah , it depends what what everybody wants to do ."
[13:08] mn082 | Yeah .
[13:09] mn082 | Yeah .
[13:10] fn083 | So
"[13:15] fn083 | Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i"
"[13:18] fn083 | Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful"
"[13:23] mn082 | Yeah , it is ."
[13:24] mn082 | Yeah .
[13:24] fn083 | when somebody arrives or
[13:25] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[13:25] mn082 | Half collection of necessary information .
[13:26] fn083 | stuff like that .
[13:26] mn030 | But there 's no personal homepage for
"[13:30] mn082 | Yeah , you can have it ."
"[13:33] mn082 | Uh , uh , le"
[13:39] mn030 | Yeah .
[13:39] mn030 | OK .
[13:45] mn082 | for for everything . So .
"[13:47] mn082 | uh , everybody 's responsible for his own , yeah ."
"[13:50] fn083 | Yeah , but but what is planned is that I do something like a"
[13:50] mn030 | Sure .
"[13:54] fn083 | previous , you know , layout , and give everybody"
[13:59] fn083 | the chance to put his content inside so
"[14:00] mn030 | OK , his name and so on ."
[14:02] mn030 | Yeah .
"[14:02] mn021 | Well , like have a blueprint ."
"[14:02] fn083 | that the layout is for everybody the same , so about the projects and stuff ."
[14:05] mn030 | OK Mm - hmm .
"[14:06] fn083 | So , there will be something ."
[14:06] mn082 | Yeah .
[14:08] mn082 | Yeah .
"[14:10] mn082 | OK , thanks . So ,"
[14:11] mn082 | let 's switch to the proposal .
[14:21] mn082 | Yeah ?
[14:21] mn030 | Yes .
"[14:22] mn082 | Yes , OK . Um ."
"[14:26] mn082 | From my point of view ,"
"[14:27] mn082 | As I mentioned before , we still in the starting position . I think the"
[14:32] mn082 | four building blocks on the network level
[14:36] mn082 | will have really a major impact on on f
[14:39] mn082 | current
"[14:40] mn082 | um ,"
"[14:41] mn082 | available wireless networks and , uh , also for future generations ."
"[14:47] mn082 | And , what the missing thing is really"
[14:49] mn082 | what kind of problem
[14:53] mn082 | wan wanna s solve
[14:56] mn082 | with such a project proposal .
"[15:02] mn082 | that , what kind of ,"
"[15:04] mn082 | maybe , service"
[15:06] mn082 | we are really going to offer .
"[15:08] mn082 | The linkage between such kind of application , also interactive multimedia application"
"[15:13] mn082 | and , uh , this kind of networking stuff is , um ,"
"[15:18] mn082 | maybe not very well aligned ,"
[15:21] mn082 | because
[15:22] mn082 | there will be
"[15:23] mn082 | of course , a portion of mobile access to such kind of application ."
"[15:27] mn082 | But , I think that 's not the majority and that is not the major focus of"
[15:34] mn082 | this kind of application anyway .
[15:36] mn082 | So I would like to to uh
[15:40] mn082 | what kind of application
[15:43] mn082 | um f far away
"[15:45] mn082 | and I would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t concerning these building blocks and the network ,"
"[15:51] mn082 | Um , What kind of problem we are going to solve . What kind of , uh , um ,"
"[15:57] mn082 | um , glue between these four building blocks exists and"
"[16:01] mn082 | what kind of synergy effects , in principle , as if they work and fit very well together"
[16:06] mn082 | exists for networking stuff .
[16:07] mn082 | And what kind of service
[16:10] mn082 | could we provide in that area .
[16:13] mn082 | We will have these
"[16:14] mn082 | kind of , uh , really"
[16:17] mn082 | closely working together of these four building blocks .
"[16:21] mn082 | So maybe uh , Wilbert , you can start to discu oder to to"
[16:26] mn082 | tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday
[16:31] mn082 | concerning certain kind of ideas . Maybe it 's a brainstorming
"[16:35] mn082 | um , of of these things"
[16:38] mn082 | and maybe we can comment
[16:41] mn082 | later on th
[16:42] mn082 | these uh
[16:44] mn082 | these ideas .
"[16:46] mn082 | And I saw you sk still discuss with with uh Mark , right ? some stuff ."
"[16:50] mn082 | Was it also related with with these things . No ? OK , It was @ @ ."
[16:51] mn081 | No .
"[16:53] mn081 | This afternoon you mean ? No , this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks"
[16:57] mn082 | OK
"[16:58] mn082 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[17:00] mn082 | Then , maybe then , one one w uh sentence before ."
[17:03] mn082 | I believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things .
"[17:07] mn082 | Because from the mathematical description with QS - in - Advance ,"
"[17:11] mn082 | me , as an expert for"
"[17:12] mn082 | quality of service and , uh , Michael as an expert for"
"[17:17] mn082 | uh , MPLS and Wilbert an expert for for Multicast ,"
"[17:20] mn082 | and , uh , I discussed with Miguel ."
"[17:23] mn082 | It 's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing , but it is still in the area of routing ."
[17:29] mn082 | So .
"[17:30] mn082 | My idea is , in principle , to have ,"
[17:31] mn082 | independently of
"[17:32] mn082 | any funding , independently of any outer contact ,"
"[17:37] mn082 | core activity , in principle . And we can"
[17:40] mn082 | see how much from the outer world can fit in .
"[17:43] mn082 | First of all , the first stage is"
[17:45] mn082 | the institution which is behind
[17:48] mn082 | everybody .
[17:49] mn082 | That means uh KPN in your case and Siemens in our case .
"[17:53] mn082 | And maybe , then , in the broader world here"
[17:55] mn082 | other partners registered in the
[17:57] mn082 | proposal migh
"[17:57] mn082 | Tomorrow , I will go to Cisco , for instance ,"
[17:59] mn082 | and I will discuss
"[18:01] mn082 | uh , all"
"[18:03] mn082 | this kind of things . Maybe they have certain additional activities and they 're interested in the results before The benefit here is , in principle , that the"
[18:10] mn082 | results are available . They are not restricted any way .
[18:13] mn082 | If you have your own common activity .
[18:15] mn082 | That makes a little bit more easier .
"[18:17] mn082 | And , uh , if there is a technical linkage between such , uh"
"[18:22] mn082 | um , between the outer world and us"
"[18:24] mn082 | OK , the better it is ."
"[18:26] mn082 | But , anyway , if we come to a certain kind of uh , common work"
"[18:30] mn082 | within the core of the NSA group ,"
[18:33] mn082 | I think
[18:34] mn082 | that 's really beneficial to
[18:35] mn082 | everybody .
"[18:38] mn082 | And uh , especially , Wilbert , if you have in mind to"
"[18:43] mn082 | mmm ,"
"[18:44] mn082 | uh , really from the"
"[18:46] mn082 | project proposal view ,"
[18:47] mn082 | I think we can
[18:50] mn082 | this core .
"[18:51] mn082 | You know ,"
[18:51] mn082 | and
"[18:52] mn082 | go to the outer world with , and and and align it in a certain way ."
"[18:55] mn082 | For instance , that it also fit , maybe , to KPN , and Siemens , and in other companies ."
[19:00] mn082 | Yeah .
[19:02] mn081 | This probably has to be a brainstorm right now .
[19:04] mn082 | Yep .
"[19:05] mn081 | Um What I told Joachim yesterday was that , uh"
"[19:09] mn081 | uh for my company the company I work for ,"
"[19:12] mn081 | they are more interested in in an explicit service ,"
[19:15] mn081 | than in
[19:16] mn081 | core technology .
[19:19] mn081 | u
"[19:19] mn081 | Me , on the other hand , I 'm more interested in"
"[19:22] mn081 | uh , core service , or c core technology , myself ."
"[19:25] mn081 | So I 'm u I was thinking about uh , how I could combine the both of them ."
"[19:30] mn081 | KPN was , um they 're interested in having , uh"
"[19:34] mn081 | like , six people or something , working on the project for one year or maybe ,"
"[19:38] mn081 | uh , three people fo working on the project for two years ,"
[19:41] mn081 | and have a kind of a demonstration
"[19:43] mn081 | uh , for a specifically in UMTS service ."
[19:46] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[19:47] mn081 | I was thinking that
[19:48] mn081 | um
"[19:51] mn081 | as a well , not really a UMTS service , but yesterday , what I discussed with Joachim was uh ,"
[19:58] mn081 | a w little bit based on your ad - hoc networking also .
[20:02] mn081 | That it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you
[20:05] mn081 | can switch
[20:06] mn081 | from
[20:07] mn081 | w a WaveLAN Technology
"[20:09] mn081 | to , um , UMTS ."
"[20:11] mn081 | I think that 's , uh , it 's in in the future that will be a main competitor of , uh ,"
"[20:16] mn081 | of UMTS ,"
[20:17] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[20:18] mn081 | too , like"
"[20:18] mn081 | the the the Lucent , uh , equipment has a l"
"[20:22] mn081 | huge scope already , like five hundred feet , or or even more sometimes ."
"[20:27] mn081 | so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building"
[20:31] mn081 | or whatever is available on that network .
[20:34] mn081 | You can switch from UMTS or
[20:37] mn081 | uh
"[20:38] mn081 | uh , to WaveLAN Technologies ."
[20:40] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[20:51] mn081 | Of course , it sounds strange for a company that does UMTS to"
[20:56] mn081 | to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to WaveLAN but
[21:00] mn081 | at the end it makes
[21:01] mn081 | it easier for your and cheaper for your customers .
"[21:06] mn081 | So , if they don't do it , somebody else will probably do it ."
"[21:11] mn021 | an a a double technology adapter , too ."
[21:15] mn021 | So you can market these
[21:16] mn021 | double - technology adapters .
"[21:19] mn021 | And , this can be a a potential"
[21:22] mn081 | Yeah .
"[21:22] mn021 | uh um you know , uh , income , too ."
"[21:26] mn021 | Because you just have to license , uh"
[21:28] mn021 | uh
[21:28] mn021 | WaveLAN technology .
"[21:30] mn021 | You can build , uh , the whole thing ."
"[21:33] mn021 | This U - UMTS WaveLAN , uh"
[21:36] mn021 | mixed together .
"[21:37] mn081 | Yeah , something like that could be possible , maybe even a UMTS - to - WaveLAN - gateway , or I 'm not sure if that 's possible like we U - if UMTS re contains redirects or"
"[21:48] mn081 | whatever , like switches ."
[21:49] mn081 | I 'm not sure about it . It could be .
"[21:51] mn021 | Mmm . I think , they are using different , uh , radio technologies . So , uh , at the physical level , they 're they 're they are not compatible ."
[21:56] mn081 | It 's not a problem .
"[22:01] mn081 | No , but s"
[22:02] mn081 | You could have a UMTS gateway
[22:04] mn081 | that translates everything to that uh w local @ @ .
[22:04] mn021 | Yeah .
[22:08] mn021 | Yeah .
[22:09] mn081 | If you will
[22:09] mn021 | That that 's right .
"[22:10] mn082 | Yet the basic idea is , in principle , to switch seamlessly between"
"[22:14] mn082 | wireless LAN technology , whatever"
"[22:17] mn082 | and UMTS , right ?"
[22:19] mn081 | Yes .
"[22:20] mn082 | And you see the benefit that , in principle , the customer will save a lot of money ."
[22:25] mn082 | Because if in - house communication like WaveLAN or maybe
"[22:29] mn082 | I see it also in the American market , some WaveLAN communication in the outer world"
[22:34] mn082 | m
"[22:35] mn082 | and that is your assumption , that the more cost"
[22:38] mn082 | uh extensive um
[22:40] mn082 | U M T S connection
[22:42] mn082 | could be
"[22:44] mn082 | principle used ,"
"[22:46] mn082 | I would like to say , over WaveLAN , and then I have a normal WaveLAN connection , right ?"
[22:49] mn081 | Yes .
[22:50] mn082 | And the router and the WaveLAN connection
[22:53] mn082 | goes into the core internet elsewhere and
[22:57] mn081 | Mm - hmm .
[22:58] mn082 | the connection is not dropped between this
[23:01] mn082 | seamless
[23:02] mn082 | hand off I would like to say .
"[23:05] mn081 | Well ,"
"[23:06] mn081 | If connection is lost , I am I 'm not sure if sometimes you 'd"
[23:09] mn081 | simply have to drop a connection .
[23:11] mn081 | If you have outstanding connections .
[23:13] mn035 | Yeah .
[23:14] mn081 | But that 's uh
"[23:15] mn081 | one thing of the internet , right ?"
"[23:17] mn081 | should be able to unplug a host , bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be ."
[23:23] mn081 | I 'm not sure i
[23:30] mn081 | I don't think so .
"[23:32] mn082 | Yeah , but if this is the final goal , it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets ' technology"
[23:39] mn082 | Right ?
"[23:39] mn021 | Yeah but I I have a point uh regarding the this question ,"
[23:44] mn021 | is eh the cost function .
[23:46] mn021 | I mean .
[23:46] mn021 | uh
[23:48] mn021 | What about the user
[23:50] mn021 | who is switching from one let 's say zero - cost area
[23:54] mn021 | network
[23:55] mn021 | to another network
[23:57] mn021 | where he has to pay .
[23:58] mn021 | It is OK for the service to continue
[24:01] mn021 | when he
[24:02] mn021 | uh switches from one network to another .
"[24:04] mn021 | But probably ,"
[24:05] mn021 | the user
[24:06] mn021 | wants to be aware that he 's switching from one place from one network to another .
"[24:11] mn021 | Because maybe ,"
"[24:12] mn021 | while he 's uh having , let 's say , a vide video conference"
[24:17] mn021 | uh over the the WaveLAN
[24:19] mn021 | oh he 's not paying any extra cost .
[24:22] mn021 | But when he continues with this service
"[24:25] mn021 | on the UMTS , he 's having to cover"
"[24:28] mn021 | uh an important let 's say , an important cost or some cost ,"
[24:32] mn021 | non - null cost .
"[24:33] mn082 | Yeah , non - null @ @"
[24:33] mn021 | So uh
[24:36] mn021 | this can
[24:37] mn021 | be something that probably the user
[24:39] mn021 | wants to be aware of .
"[24:40] mn021 | Of course , this doesn't mean"
[24:42] mn021 | that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches .
[24:50] mn021 | to the uh um
[24:52] mn021 | non - null cost area network . But
[24:54] mn021 | maybe
[24:55] mn021 | some users want to do this .
"[24:58] mn021 | I 'm not willing to pay any back for this service , because I 'm just watching uh you know the sports news ."
"[25:06] mn021 | If if , because of my"
"[25:08] mn021 | motion , I 'm switching ,"
[25:10] mn021 | or I 'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh
"[25:13] mn021 | wave uh wireless uh local area network , well , I I want the service to be uh stopped . """
[25:18] mn021 | And this
[25:19] mn021 | can be some pattern then that some users will follow .
[25:24] mn035 | Yeah .
"[25:24] mn082 | Yeah , but if your s"
[25:25] mn082 | uh I believe everybody is aware about the USAIA architecture .
"[25:31] mn082 | this stuff is , here , also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system ."
"[25:36] mn082 | And in my conf uh considered end system ,"
"[25:39] mn082 | there is a certain kind of policy ,"
[25:42] mn082 | concerning how to use subnets technologies
"[25:44] mn082 | and and all these kind of things . How to use quality of service , you know ,"
"[25:47] mn082 | in advance , because you have to pay"
[25:49] mn082 | for certain technologies and maybe for certain services .
[25:52] mn082 | And that should not be done automatically . But it could be done automatically . But nevertheless there must be a certain kind of
[25:58] mn082 | um
"[25:58] mn082 | user interaction always possible ,"
[26:00] mn082 | that you could set up a certain kind of
[26:02] mn082 | mini - database how to deal with all these kind of things .
[26:06] mn082 | I think that 's not a problem .
[26:07] mn082 | But uh what I I would like to ask
"[26:09] mn082 | Wilbert here , and we discuss it yesterday ,"
"[26:15] mn082 | instead of GSM today , UMTS , and instead of wireless LAN today"
[26:19] mn082 | also wireless LAN . Remember your four and one card
"[26:23] mn082 | uh concerning um ,"
"[26:24] mn082 | what is the name ,"
[26:25] mn082 | from Dataco - ? No .
[26:27] mn082 | Dacom
"[26:28] mn081 | Oh , the one I have Sitcom ? Yeah ."
"[26:28] mn082 | Where you can enable four technologies , and you"
"[26:30] mn082 | plug in , in your laptop and then you have"
[26:32] mn082 | every four
[26:34] mn082 | uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop .
"[26:39] mn082 | Is that the problem ? Yeah , that 's not the problem . Right ."
[26:42] mn081 | Um .
"[26:44] mn081 | Well , the switching itself could be a problem ."
[26:47] mn082 | Why ?
[26:47] mn081 | Becau - well it 's a
[26:49] mn081 | depends like y you 're not going to probe on four different networks
"[26:52] mn081 | if one of the other networks is available , maybe you are , I don't know ."
[26:57] mn081 | So that could be a t
"[26:58] mn081 | topic for research , so maybe you know more about it ."
"[26:58] mn082 | Yeah , but this i"
"[27:00] mn082 | Yeah , but this is th only the probing to"
[27:02] mn082 | figure out that you get at a certain location
[27:05] mn082 | the information that a s certain coverage of a certain subnet techn technology is available .
"[27:11] mn082 | And if so ,"
[27:11] mn081 | Yeah .
"[27:11] mn082 | then what Miguel mentions , then you add a certain kind of policy , to switch or not to switch ,"
"[27:16] mn082 | to this kind of technology , right ?"
[27:18] mn081 | Y Yes .
[27:19] mn082 | But this is end - system related .
[27:22] mn082 | That 's not network related .
[27:24] mn081 | Um .
[27:28] mn082 | in this uh idea .
[27:30] mn082 | It 's only to set up i u
[27:32] mn082 | For me it 's like a laptop t to plug
[27:34] mn082 | one
[27:35] mn082 | PCMCIA and currently will have two
[27:38] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[27:38] mn082 | PCMCIA cards , and I compare GSM with UMTS ."
"[27:41] mn082 | And today I would like to have GSM , and then I have my GSM connectivity ."
"[27:47] mn082 | other technology , only"
"[27:49] mn082 | GSM , because the interfaces , the driver interface ,"
[27:54] mn082 | between different technologies . So if I want to go to wireless LAN
[27:58] mn082 | I have to stop my connection and
"[28:00] mn082 | put in my wireless LAN PCMCIA card , and then I can go on and set up the the same connection one more time ."
"[28:06] mn082 | And what you have in mind , to do it a bit more seamlessly ,"
[28:09] mn082 | and that makes an only sense for me
"[28:11] mn082 | if both technologies ,"
"[28:13] mn082 | in principle , were close together in that sense for application ."
"[28:16] mn082 | For instance ,"
"[28:17] mn082 | the application would be that I have my laptop here ,"
"[28:20] mn082 | and I work here with wi with my device ,"
"[28:22] mn082 | any kind of device , and I work here in wireless LAN area ."
"[28:25] mn082 | And then I go outside , and want to go still on ,"
[28:28] mn082 | leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless LAN .
"[28:32] mn082 | And at a certain state , the device"
[28:34] mn082 | uh receives certain signals that the coverage of UMTS or GSM is available .
"[28:39] mn082 | And at that state ,"
"[28:40] mn082 | you automatically , or based on the certain kind of user profile ,"
[28:43] mn082 | switched
[28:44] mn082 | to the
[28:45] mn082 | um
[28:46] mn082 | UMTS or GSM st uh network .
[28:49] mn082 | That 's the only
"[28:50] mn082 | senseful application . From my understanding , that means"
[28:52] mn082 | only to have a certain kind of control layer
"[28:56] mn082 | for the different drivers ,"
[28:57] mn082 | which you also mentioned as a USAIA architecture .
[29:00] mn082 | and uh then to
[29:02] mn082 | do the switching
[29:05] mn082 | for an existing stream or application
"[29:08] mn082 | uh , transparently to this application ,"
[29:10] mn082 | between those
[29:11] mn082 | uh these both technologies .
"[29:14] mn082 | Maybe there 's more potential . I don't s see it , but maybe you have a"
[29:18] mn082 | additional idea . And I don't think
[29:20] mn082 | that
[29:22] mn082 | this end system device
"[29:25] mn082 | uh architecture ,"
[29:27] mn082 | which will come automatically .
"[29:29] mn082 | And I believe there 's a lot of activity throughout the world ,"
[29:32] mn082 | because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned
[29:35] mn082 | elsewhere where you cou
[29:39] mn082 | uh uh
[29:39] mn081 | If if you can leave it out the network
[29:41] mn081 | that will be really cool .
[29:43] mn081 | That 's
[29:46] mn081 | Yes .
"[29:47] mn021 | But when quality of service comes to the uh scene ,"
[29:52] mn021 | a bigger problem because
[29:54] mn021 | maybe this this uh
[29:56] mn021 | uh seamless migration cannot be
"[29:59] mn021 | seamless at all , because"
[30:01] mn021 | maybe the the quality of service we are getting
"[30:05] mn021 | when we are connected to a certain network ,"
"[30:08] mn021 | let 's say high - speed networking ,"
[30:10] mn021 | cannot be sustained when we are
[30:12] mn021 | switching to a different technology .
"[30:14] mn021 | So , this is another"
[30:17] mn021 | thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble
[30:22] mn021 | our
"[30:25] mn082 | Now , I would like not to hear only"
[30:25] mn035 | Hm -
[30:27] mn082 | three opinions . But maybe there are also other opinions . And
[30:28] mn021 | OK .
"[30:28] mn021 | Yeah . Oh , sorry ."
"[30:33] mn082 | Let us understand ,"
[30:34] mn035 | Yeah .
[30:34] mn082 | built for everybody and
[30:36] mn082 | their com whether their comments .
[30:38] mn035 | In this
[30:39] mn035 | thing of seamless
[30:41] mn035 | handoff or handovers should think more
[30:45] mn035 | maybe in different layers ?
[30:47] mn035 | So one layer is having the seamless
[30:49] mn035 | handover .
"[30:50] mn035 | It 's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service ,"
[30:54] mn035 | you can't do magic and have it .
[30:56] mn035 | There are
[30:57] mn035 | certain constraints on that .
"[31:04] mn035 | There , it is possible ."
[31:06] mn035 | So that should be made possible then ?
[31:09] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[31:10] mn021 | Yeah .
[31:10] mn021 | Yeah .
[31:10] mn035 | So
[31:13] mn035 | Yeah .
[31:14] mn021 | Mmm uh
[31:14] mn035 | There are still enough problems i
[31:14] mn021 | Trying to to to to poi to pinpoint
[31:17] mn035 | Yeah .
[31:17] mn021 | The the possible problems .
[31:19] mn035 | Yep .
[31:20] mn035 | But it might be
[31:21] mn035 | the wrong
"[31:22] mn035 | thing to promise ,"
"[31:24] mn035 | uh , ten megabits to everywhere . There you are ."
"[31:28] mn035 | But saying "" OK"
"[31:31] mn035 | if the technology is OK , you can do it . """
[31:38] mn035 | Yep .
"[31:39] mn021 | to support , you can"
[31:41] mn021 | offer this warran this uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you you can get .
[31:43] mn035 | Yep .
[31:46] mn035 | Yeah .
"[31:46] mn021 | So , if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount ,"
[31:51] mn021 | no problem at all .
"[31:52] mn021 | But in this case , maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service because you just have"
[31:59] mn021 | a usually a huge bandwidth compared
[32:02] mn035 | Yeah .
[32:03] mn021 | on a a w with what the user is is using .
[32:05] mn035 | Yep .
[32:07] mn035 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:08] mn021 | I mean , if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second , of course , you can uh build"
[32:15] mn021 | uh
[32:17] mn021 | certain reserve mechanisms
[32:20] mn021 | to warranty the user these
[32:22] mn021 | two kilobits per second bandwidth . But probably
[32:25] mn021 | in it isn't it is not worth because you have so
[32:29] mn021 | many uh available bandwidths that
[32:32] mn021 | maybe uh it is not a problem .
"[32:35] mn082 | Oh , please come in ."
[32:36] mn021 | Hi .
[32:36] mn035 | Hi .
[32:37] fn083 | Hmm ?
[32:43] fn083 | OK .
[32:45] mn082 | Uh . OK Good luck .
"[32:46] mn021 | Oh , OK ."
[32:53] mn081 | The the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those
[32:54] mn082 | Yeah .
[32:59] mn081 | uh four areas .
[33:00] mn082 | Yeah .
"[33:01] mn082 | And the building blocks , yeah . Multicast , not a topic ."
[33:04] mn082 | Routing ?
[33:05] mn081 | So so we went through uh uh
[33:08] mn081 | to through multicast .
[33:10] mn081 | So this architecture with m
"[33:12] mn081 | well , at least no wireless environment or a mobile IP environment ,"
[33:17] mn081 | comparable to uh UMTS environments .
"[33:23] mn081 | well , difficulties there ."
"[33:26] mn081 | On the blackboard , that is ."
"[33:27] mn081 | Of course , in real life there will b probably be some problems ."
[33:30] mn021 | Have you have you read about this uh Barwan project held at Berkeley University ?
"[33:35] mn082 | Well , what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday ."
[33:36] mn081 | Iceberg ?
[33:38] mn021 | Yeah .
"[33:38] mn082 | Yeah , I c I didn't find the time ,"
[33:40] mn021 | OK .
"[33:40] mn082 | yeah , to do so , but ,"
[33:42] mn082 | uh
[33:42] mn081 | You mean the Iceberg project ?
[33:43] mn021 | Barwan .
[33:44] mn081 | Barwan of uh ES
[33:45] mn021 | Barwan .
[33:46] mn035 | How 's it start ?
[33:46] mn081 | I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz .
[33:49] mn021 | Uh da it was another related
[33:51] mn021 | project called Daedalus .
[33:53] mn081 | Yes .
[33:55] mn021 | And uh well it seems they
[33:59] mn021 | uh things si somehow similar to this .
[34:04] mn081 | They worked together wi little bit with Nokia ?
[34:05] mn021 | u
[34:07] mn021 | Uh Don't know .
[34:07] mn081 | Palo Alto ?
[34:09] mn081 | Mountain View ?
[34:11] mn021 | I just uh
[34:17] mn021 | uh read
[34:18] mn021 | about this uh a long time ago .
[34:21] mn021 | And it the the latest report I I found
[34:25] mn021 | was in nineteen ninety eight .
"[34:27] mn021 | And in this report , well , they they pres they have uh some slides , some uh papers , some well , a lot of things ."
[34:29] mn081 | Hmm .
[34:34] mn021 | And well
[34:36] mn021 | the main thing
[34:37] mn021 | and the quick uh thing I I was uh looking at was a a video
[34:42] mn021 | available in MP - thr in MPG M - peg format .
[34:47] mn021 | well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of
[34:51] mn021 | one guy
"[34:52] mn021 | with a portable computer ,"
[34:54] mn021 | moving
[34:55] mn021 | across different networks .
[34:57] mn021 | So starting at the CS department at Berkeley
[35:00] mn021 | and then going out the street
"[35:02] mn021 | switching to the a campus - wide network ,"
[35:04] mn021 | uh um I think it 's a Metricom
"[35:07] mn021 | uh network ,"
"[35:10] mn082 | A Ricochet here , right ?"
"[35:12] mn021 | Ricochet , yeah , that 's right ."
[35:12] mn082 | Yeah .
[35:13] mn082 | Yeah .
[35:13] mn082 | Yeah .
"[35:14] mn021 | And then , finally switching to I think it was city PD or something like this ."
[35:19] mn021 | OK .
[35:20] mn021 | I as lo uh as the as the user is moving
[35:23] mn021 | out of the of the coverage area of this second network .
"[35:27] mn021 | And , well , what they have built is a"
[35:30] mn021 | a kind of uh proxy structure .
[35:33] mn021 | So
[35:34] mn021 | they are they are putting most of the work
[35:37] mn021 | of this adaptational layer
[35:40] mn021 | on the side of the proxies . So the client or the server is not
"[35:45] mn021 | It is the proxy , the one that does the work ."
[35:47] mn081 | Yeah .
[35:51] mn021 | It 's the same ?
[35:51] mn082 | Ah we just discussed a lot about proxies .
"[35:54] mn021 | Oh , OK ."
[35:55] mn081 | I like them so
[36:04] mn021 | oh maybe a more in - depth look at this project just to see
[36:08] mn021 | if
[36:08] mn021 | we are
"[36:09] mn021 | doing the same , or if we are doing something similar ."
[36:14] mn081 | Yeah .
[36:15] mn021 | to to highlight the differences .
"[36:17] mn021 | Because if not , well , they can say , "" Oh , you are doing the same thing . """
[36:21] mn081 | Or maybe talk to them about s
"[36:24] mn021 | Yeah , well we are close ."
[36:24] mn081 | operations they thought of but didn't touch yet .
[36:27] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:27] mn082 | Uh maybe a few comments . First of all ,"
"[36:30] mn082 | Um . Do you mind Mi - Miguel , to write the name of the project on the whiteboard ?"
[36:33] mn021 | Yeah .
[36:34] mn021 | No problem .
[36:35] mn082 | Uh I I will send also the pointer
"[36:38] mn082 | which Miguel sent to me , to everybody so that everybody can"
[36:42] mn082 | take a look to this
"[36:43] mn082 | uh , project ."
[36:45] mn082 | And uh I don't know what avail information is available because
[36:48] mn082 | I didn't find the time currently to check it out .
[36:51] mn030 | It 's a project of the UC .
"[36:53] mn021 | Yeah , UC Ber - uh Berkeley , yeah ."
"[36:53] mn030 | Oh , yeah ."
[36:53] mn082 | Yeah .
[36:54] mn081 | Wh - when did you go through this ?
[36:58] mn021 | I seen uh
[37:00] mn021 | uh reports from
"[37:02] mn021 | nineteen ninety uh ninety - six , ninety - seven and ninety - eight ."
[37:07] mn081 | Cuz yesterday I was uh
"[37:08] mn081 | Well coincidentally , I b bumped into this project here ."
[37:09] mn021 | n uh
[37:12] mn081 | It 's funny .
"[37:14] mn082 | Uh , sorry ?"
"[37:14] mn081 | Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit ."
[37:17] mn082 | Mm - hmm . Ah !
"[37:18] mn081 | And then from Nokia I came to this that project , so ."
"[37:20] mn082 | Ah ! OK , I see ."
[37:21] mn082 | Yeah ? @ @ OK .
[37:23] mn021 | I think that that the leader was uh Professor Katz .
[37:25] mn081 | That 's right . And he 's also
[37:27] mn081 | board
[37:28] mn081 | in Nokia
[37:29] mn021 | OK .
[37:30] mn082 | Mm - hmm . Then the second thing is that uh Daimler - Chrysler research here
"[37:34] mn082 | in Palo Alto as well as in Germany , Ulm ,"
"[37:37] mn082 | is doing , in principle , the same with a car ."
[37:39] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[37:39] mn082 | They have a specific antenna for
"[37:42] mn082 | uh GSM Oh , GPS and and fu for future"
[37:46] mn082 | extended G - uh GSM networks and wireless LAN and and other thi and other network technology .
[37:52] mn082 | In the roof of the car .
[37:54] mn082 | They have a s
[37:55] mn082 | lot of servers
[37:56] mn082 | in
[37:57] mn082 | the trunk of the car .
[37:59] mn082 | Then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things and they
[38:03] mn082 | are driving around the different areas . And the same car exists here in Palo Alto
[38:07] mn082 | uh based on
"[38:08] mn082 | wireless LAN , GSM and 2 x Ricochet networks ."
[38:11] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[38:11] mn082 | They collect the dat collect collecting a lot of data .
[38:15] mn082 | concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed
[38:20] mn082 | and um
"[38:22] mn082 | uh , Thomas is going to"
[38:25] mn082 | build mobile IP
[38:27] mn082 | stuff in
[38:29] mn082 | their servers .
[38:30] mn082 | uh
[38:31] mn082 | because they want to
[38:33] mn082 | use current technology with a c a combination of mobile IP .
[38:37] mn082 | So I think there is a lot of activities in the area .
[38:39] mn082 | Uh . And my third uh comment is
[38:43] mn082 | uh if we are going something in that direction
[38:46] mn082 | that is quite different from this thing here .
"[38:49] mn082 | But , anyway , maybe as a core technology with a real"
[38:52] mn082 | product in mind .
[38:53] mn082 | I see some difficulty because nobody
[38:56] mn082 | currently has here certain kind uh of UMTS know how .
[39:00] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[39:02] mn082 | And you need it definitely because then it j must be your
[39:04] mn082 | uh
[39:05] mn082 | Bible I would like to say
[39:07] mn082 | that you are very familiar with UMTS if you wanna go
[39:10] mn082 | in in that way .
[39:11] mn082 | And
[39:12] mn082 | As far as I know the UMTS standardization is not finished yet .
"[39:16] mn082 | Ninety percent , maybe , or eighty percent . I kno I 'm not sure ."
[39:20] mn082 | But uh
[39:20] mn021 | Yeah b le let me let me ask you
[39:22] mn082 | Yeah .
[39:22] mn021 | a question about eh UMTS or or
[39:25] mn021 | third or possible fourth
[39:27] mn021 | generation
[39:28] mn021 | communic wireless communication systems .
"[39:31] mn021 | Uh , from the point of view of the user ,"
"[39:33] mn021 | uh is there uh something more that nnn , that than more speed ?"
"[39:40] mn021 | Is there any other advantage ,"
[39:43] mn021 | from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals ?
[39:46] mn082 | Users of of UMTS ?
[39:48] mn021 | Yeah .
[39:49] mn082 | You can request certain kind of QS .
[39:52] mn082 | You can even request it in GPS but
[39:55] mn082 | it 's not end - to - end quality of service .
[39:56] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[39:57] mn082 | It is only um what the gateways
[40:01] mn021 | OK . Yeah .
[40:01] mn082 | get .
[40:02] mn082 | And within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up
"[40:06] mn082 | in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core ."
[40:10] mn082 | And you use certain kind of tunnel
[40:12] mn082 | mechanism to
"[40:14] mn082 | combine , in principle , the base"
[40:19] mn082 | uh is controlled by a certain kind of node .
[40:21] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[40:22] mn082 | And you have the gateway to the PDN , or the Public Data Network ."
[40:25] mn082 | And between both there 's a certain kind of tunnel set up .
"[40:28] mn021 | But in fact now , at the GSM level ,"
[40:32] mn021 | what you have
[40:33] mn021 | is that every voice channel you use
[40:35] mn021 | provides a a p a pretty fine fixed
[40:39] mn021 | uh data speed .
"[40:41] mn021 | So , we can say that every voice channel"
[40:47] mn021 | implied
"[40:50] mn021 | quality of service ,"
[40:51] mn021 | which is
[40:52] mn021 | nnn ninety six hundred
[40:55] mn021 | bits per second .
[40:56] mn021 | Full duplex .
[40:58] mn021 | Doesn't it ?
[41:00] mn021 | Yeah .
[41:00] mn082 | Yeah .
[41:00] mn082 | Yeah .
[41:01] mn021 | So .
"[41:02] mn082 | Yeah , what is what means quality of service . A certain degree . Right ?"
[41:06] mn021 | Yeah .
[41:07] mn082 | Uh .
"[41:09] mn021 | No , but um but not only because of of data speed , but also"
"[41:13] mn021 | about delay ,"
"[41:14] mn021 | you know , because"
[41:15] mn021 | GSM networks
[41:17] mn021 | were
[41:18] mn021 | developed to y uh with a voice service in mind .
"[41:22] mn021 | Ah , delay is also considered in these networks ."
"[41:26] mn021 | So ,"
"[41:27] mn021 | uh , in fact for every voice channel you have"
"[41:30] mn021 | uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter ,"
[41:34] mn021 | and a a a specified
[41:37] mn021 | um data speed .
[41:38] mn021 | So
[41:41] mn021 | scale up this uh
[41:43] mn021 | this um thing
[41:45] mn021 | by using several channels .
"[41:47] mn021 | So , in fact ,"
"[41:48] mn021 | you have ,"
"[41:50] mn021 | using just GSM technology ,"
[41:52] mn021 | you have more or less the same
[41:53] mn021 | building blocks
[41:55] mn021 | as you can get
[41:56] mn021 | uh with the UMTS .
[41:58] mn021 | I mean
"[41:59] mn021 | that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different ,"
[42:03] mn021 | that uh the base station thing is different and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different but from the point of view of the mobile things
[42:13] mn021 | uh
[42:16] mn082 | It 's packaged data oriented .
[42:23] mn082 | a involvement in the core network .
"[42:26] mn082 | You have , in principle , the path which still is available"
"[42:29] mn082 | for for the GSM network . Also they use , in principle , the same"
[42:33] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[42:33] mn082 | uh the same mechanism .
[42:37] mn082 | dat uh packet
[42:38] mn082 | oriented
[42:39] mn082 | communication that 's on the GPS stuff .
"[42:41] mn082 | And that 's also related to UMTS . So ,"
"[42:44] mn021 | You know , it is also being d uh"
"[42:47] mn021 | developed , this G uh P - DPRS thing ,"
[42:50] mn021 | GPRS thing .
"[42:52] mn021 | which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM . So ,"
[42:56] mn021 | I mean .
"[42:57] mn021 | Uh , I don't see that"
[42:59] mn021 | a a lot of difference . We can expect a lot of differences
[43:03] mn021 | f uh from the uh mobile terminal
[43:06] mn021 | point of view .
"[43:07] mn021 | Uh , when uh UMTS"
[43:09] mn021 | be deployed .
"[43:14] mn021 | well , uh"
[43:14] mn021 | maybe
[43:15] mn021 | uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh
[43:19] mn021 | be uh um were um a UMTS expert because
[43:24] mn021 | uh I I don't see it I think that
[43:26] mn021 | the UMTS thing is more
"[43:28] mn021 | a technology issue ,"
[43:30] mn021 | than a research issue .
[43:32] mn021 | Maybe I 'm wrong .
"[43:34] mn082 | No , I think there 's a lot Yeah . I think there 's a lot of research . But the question is "" is this uh"
[43:35] mn021 | explaining my m
"[43:39] mn082 | a research wh in which direction we are going ? """
[43:43] mn082 | For inf
[43:51] mn021 | But the point is that uh this is probably not here .
"[43:55] mn021 | Because uh well , you know the the the orientation of our group which is"
"[43:59] mn021 | uh "" Networks"
"[44:00] mn021 | Services and Applications "" , not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology ."
[44:07] mn030 | You think more about hardware technology .
"[44:09] mn021 | Yeah . You know , radio frequency technology , wide - band w uh CDMA ."
[44:13] mn021 | These kind of things
[44:15] mn021 | all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched . But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing here .
"[44:23] mn082 | Right , but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different ."
"[44:26] mn082 | The picture I have in mind concerning UMTS is , first of all , if you use UMTS only for voice ,"
"[44:31] mn082 | Like you did it or are doing now for GSM ,"
[44:34] mn082 | it 's not worth to have this kind of network .
"[44:37] mn082 | And , currently in Europe , where it will be deployed first , I believe ,"
"[44:40] mn082 | it will be very hard , in principle , to get some money back if you have only"
[44:44] mn082 | for using it for voice . Because they paid a lot of money . So .
"[44:45] mn021 | Voice , yeah ."
[44:47] mn082 | What is the point ? The point is that
[44:49] mn082 | you use the UMTS to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which
[44:53] mn082 | are still not available up to now .
[44:56] mn082 | But the problem is if you have the internet
"[44:58] mn082 | content , and you have maybe your small uh"
[45:01] mn082 | um device
[45:07] mn082 | certain mobile
"[45:09] mn082 | phones ,"
[45:09] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[45:09] mn082 | then you have certain kind of problems , you know , because you cannot use these things ."
"[45:13] mn082 | And WAP is not an answer for for these kind of things , you know ."
[45:16] mn082 | So .
"[45:17] mn082 | The I believe there is a lot of research work and also if you see the end - to - end scope of the internet ,"
"[45:21] mn082 | from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server , "" correspondent node "" , or whatever you call this destination ,"
"[45:27] mn082 | then you have certain kind of models , for instance , for the quality of service and all these kind of things ."
[45:31] mn082 | And then is UMTS
[45:32] mn082 | only one link where you have certain kind of subnet
[45:35] mn082 | layer technology .
[45:36] mn082 | And you have to match these things anyway .
[45:39] mn082 | It 's like a normal ethernet .
[45:41] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[45:41] mn082 | Whatever you see , it is only an additional subnet layer technology ."
[45:42] mn021 | Yeah .
[45:44] mn082 | And you have all the
[45:45] mn082 | things mapped
"[45:47] mn082 | to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff , in principle , to this technology ."
"[45:53] mn082 | And furthermore , you see that the trend is to put more"
"[45:55] mn082 | IP technology ,"
"[45:57] mn082 | really , really IP technology , and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations ,"
[46:02] mn082 | to their access network itself .
"[46:05] mn082 | And th there 's a lot of potential , as I believe , for for uh certain research work ."
"[46:12] mn082 | But the question is , first of all ,"
"[46:13] mn082 | "" Do we have the competence to do something like that ? """
[46:16] mn082 | First of all .
"[46:17] mn082 | Second , we are not hardware builders ,"
[46:19] mn082 | in that sense to set up certain kind of
[46:22] mn082 | end systems .
"[46:23] mn082 | We can design them ,"
"[46:25] mn082 | yeah , from the protocol layering and and maybe have some simulations , or whatever ."
[46:30] mn082 | But isn't the final outcome really such a device ?
"[46:33] mn082 | Prototype , Linux based ."
"[46:35] mn082 | And we go around here and we have maybe a GPS - base station sponsored by Ericsson ,"
[46:39] mn082 | since they are living not so far away and and
"[46:42] mn082 | maybe WaveLAN connection , here now a testbed and then then figure out that it works ?"
"[46:46] mn082 | So , that 's my point ."
"[46:50] mn081 | Well , just to make the list a little bit longer ."
[46:52] mn082 | Yep .
"[46:54] mn081 | Um , you could also"
"[46:55] mn081 | think about uh session management . I do along with uh the network applications and services , uh"
[47:01] mn081 | as you might know . It 's a a
[47:03] mn081 | if you can do it in the end systems or
"[47:06] mn081 | at sp specific servers , then ,"
[47:08] mn081 | I 'm in favor of that .
"[47:09] mn081 | But se session management , I mean uh the authentication , if you go from one network to the other ,"
"[47:14] mn081 | it 's not solved . uh ,"
[47:15] mn081 | Nobody really wants a a guest
[47:18] mn081 | on your network .
"[47:27] mn081 | at the Barwan project , as you said ,"
[47:29] mn081 | go through proxies .
"[47:31] mn081 | There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies ,"
[47:36] mn081 | s zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit .
[47:40] mn081 | That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management .
[47:44] mn081 | Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets . It 's almost perfect .
"[47:48] mn081 | They s kind of skipped uh layer five ,"
"[47:51] mn081 | uh session management or session layer ,"
[47:54] mn081 | I think .
"[47:55] mn081 | That 's um normally with if you do a socket programming , it 's directly"
"[48:00] mn081 | the prot application protocol on layer four ,"
"[48:03] mn081 | uh TCP socket , or layer five for"
[48:07] mn081 | UDP socket .
"[48:08] mn081 | There might also be some research Well ,"
[48:14] mn081 | Norm - what they do right now is they
[48:16] mn081 | make it part of the
[48:18] mn081 | application - level protocol .
[48:20] mn081 | That 's what they do most often . Like with session management ? for mobile the uh
[48:25] mn081 | applications such as ist instant messaging or
"[48:28] mn081 | uh talks , and so on , uh like zip ."
[48:32] mn081 | It 's just doing a a reconnect .
[48:34] mn081 | If they think that the network is different or
"[48:37] mn081 | different capabilities come into play , they simply do a reconnect so it 's part of the protocol ."
"[48:42] mn081 | That 's all what I think about session management , like"
[48:45] mn081 | part of in proxies or
[48:47] mn081 | is it en embedded in application level protocols ?
[48:50] mn082 | But it 's really
[48:52] mn082 | higher level .
[48:53] mn082 | Right ? It 's no more related to a network . We are leaving the network area .
[48:57] mn082 | That 's dangerous .
[49:00] mn081 | So how do you want to focus on network services .
"[49:00] mn082 | Cuz if you go to the app If you For me that 's starting with middleware aspects , you know ?"
"[49:05] mn081 | Well the So "" network applications "" , if you look at the name of the group ,"
[49:11] mn081 | one thing is that um
[49:13] mn081 | the
"[49:14] mn081 | they used to call a a n a "" network """
[49:17] mn081 | that was uh if it was
[49:19] mn081 | like distributed between two systems connected
[49:22] mn081 | by a network .
"[49:23] mn081 | If you look at "" network """
[49:25] mn081 | from the
"[49:27] mn081 | OZ layer ,"
[49:28] mn081 | then it 's
"[49:31] mn081 | maybe level three , but"
[49:33] mn081 | everything below three .
"[49:36] mn081 | So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh "" network "" ."
"[49:41] mn082 | No , I believe "" network "" is , if you see it really from from the IP"
"[49:46] mn082 | protocol suite ,"
[49:47] mn082 | is
"[49:48] mn082 | then layer one , in principle , up t including layer four ,"
"[49:52] mn082 | despite the fact that layer four is only residing , normally ,"
[49:55] mn082 | in the end system and in the gateways .
"[49:57] mn081 | But are there "" network applications "" , then ?"
[49:57] mn082 | Yeah .
"[50:01] mn081 | So , the the name is "" Network Services and Applications "" , s so what could be an en example of a network application if you"
[50:07] mn081 | look at the OZ stick ?
"[50:10] mn082 | Yeah , we have , I think , some . Yeah ."
"[50:12] mn082 | Do you see this word "" application "" related to a network ?"
[50:15] mn082 | Or do you see this word independently ? That was never discussed in detail .
"[50:20] mn082 | "" Network Services and Applications "" . So , everything"
[50:23] mn082 | in the world . Or is the application related to the network ?
"[50:26] mn082 | For my understanding and as far as we discussed , so such a long time"
"[50:32] mn082 | For instance , e - commerce ."
"[50:34] mn081 | OK , OK , well , they will I didn't want to get a discussion now ."
"[50:34] mn082 | And it 's really , really yeah"
[50:36] mn082 | You know ? That Yeah .
[50:43] mn082 | uh to the network . But not any application .
"[50:46] mn082 | And we also have the aspects for security . Miguel , you mentioned here authentication and and triple - A , but we do not have any expert anymore ."
[50:54] mn082 | Because
[50:54] mn082 | Hannes was an expert for that .
[51:03] mn082 | basic building blocks
[51:04] mn082 | in the proposal from the networking side .
[51:07] mn082 | We could have a certain kind of application
[51:10] mn082 | and there 's a
[51:11] mn082 | lot of activities in the outside world and I believe there 's a lot of contacts .
[51:16] mn082 | Or there could be
[51:17] mn082 | a lot of contacts uh with with these people .
[51:21] mn082 | Especially at uh Georgia Tech . I know on next week on
[51:24] mn082 | Tuesday .
"[51:25] mn082 | Tuesday , right ?"
[51:26] mn082 | We will go to UCB .
[51:28] mn082 | There are three guys .
[51:30] mn082 | Then
[51:31] mn082 | Morgan mentioned one .
[51:33] mn082 | I do not know exactly um
"[51:35] mn082 | uh what he is doing , but ,"
[51:37] mn082 | he 's also interesting in some kind of collaboration . He 's also a professor in the UCB .
"[51:43] mn082 | And uh many universities maybe Claudia mentioned Duisburg . And uh in principle ,"
[51:49] mn082 | most of the university have some activities in that area .
"[51:52] mn082 | We will not take care about these one , but we can use them as"
[51:56] mn082 | for field ex uh field trial access and and and maybe some support and and whatever kind of thing .
[52:02] mn082 | And we focus really on the networking stuff and going in more detail in this
[52:07] mn082 | area .
[52:07] mn082 | And the alternative is maybe what
[52:10] mn082 | uh
[52:10] mn082 | currently we have only
[52:12] mn082 | uh this
[52:13] mn082 | uh proposal from Wilbert
[52:15] mn082 | to go more in the
[52:16] mn082 | smaller scope .
[52:18] mn082 | Figure out some potential from
[52:22] mn082 | maybe this
[52:26] mn082 | and starting from that .
"[52:29] mn082 | Or , are there other suggestions ?"
[52:31] mn030 | I think we uh
"[52:33] mn030 | have already so much work put into this proposal , why to switch now ?"
[52:39] mn030 | So I don't see the reason for that .
[52:42] mn030 | Maybe
[52:43] mn030 | the application we suggested is not the best one .
[52:47] mn030 | So we have to think about an application which which is um
"[52:52] mn030 | um , for mobile users , more relevant ."
[52:57] mn030 | I don't know . Maybe video games . If you are traveling
"[53:00] mn030 | uh , it 's boring to travel and then"
[53:02] mn030 | you decide to play a g video game with somebody else who 's traveling .
"[53:08] mn082 | Yeah , you know , it 's still mentioned in the proposal ."
[53:08] mn030 | So .
[53:10] mn082 | And
[53:11] mn082 | th um
"[53:13] mn082 | I 'm sure , OK , that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application ,"
[53:19] mn082 | but uh And In in the end of the text in the end of the pr text of the proposal .
[53:25] mn082 | But it is mentioned that it is only an example .
[53:27] mn082 | And that we use this
"[53:29] mn082 | application , in principle , while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access"
[53:34] mn082 | to these kind of things .
[53:36] mn082 | When you have a video
[53:38] mn082 | game server
[53:39] mn082 | and and you want to have mobile access
"[53:42] mn082 | you must at least have one in your consortium ,"
"[53:45] mn082 | or as a partner whatever ,"
[53:47] mn082 | who provides this service .
[53:48] mn082 | And then
"[53:50] mn082 | we we are playing videos , in principle , if you have a field trial ."
"[53:57] mn082 | certain kind of access to the University ,"
"[54:00] mn082 | and uh to this server , which is run on the campus of the University ."
"[54:04] mn030 | OK , that 's right ."
[54:04] mn082 | And that is the point .
[54:10] mn082 | and the the um
"[54:13] mn082 | um , now , how to say , the requirements of this application using"
[54:17] mn082 | this
[54:18] mn082 | classroom scenario .
"[54:19] mn082 | But nevertheless , it 's not the best for 3 x"
[54:21] mn082 | and and and and uh
[54:23] mn082 | s networking stuff .
[54:25] mn082 | You are right .
[54:28] mn082 | But it Does anybody see
"[54:31] mn082 | certain kind of potential here to go on ,"
[54:34] mn082 | and to start the work
[54:36] mn082 | maybe in this
[54:37] mn082 | little bit smaller
[54:40] mn082 | oh uh scope
[54:43] mn082 | based on these building blocks ? Because Multicast you still mentio uh you mentioned that there is no potential . I think it 's
"[54:48] mn082 | described here that the potential , if you use it for the mapping to the"
[54:52] mn082 | next generation networks
[54:54] mn082 | in the wireless
[54:55] mn082 | access
[54:56] mn082 | area
[54:57] mn082 | they are still some potential to map
[54:59] mn082 | Multicast
[55:01] mn082 | because they do not use it .
[55:04] mn082 | And to figure out whether they 're useful inse instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels and
[55:10] mn082 | have the mapping between a PSDN uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using
"[55:15] mn082 | to IP addresses and then there 's the tunnel I Ds , and and"
"[55:18] mn082 | all this kind of things , I think , is very beneficial"
[55:21] mn082 | as well for for telecommunication providers .
[55:25] mn082 | as well as for ISP 's .
[55:28] mn082 | I I think the potential is still there . You you
"[55:30] mn082 | neglected that , but I don't think that you are right in that sense ."
[55:42] mn082 | In next generation ? Yeah .
"[55:44] mn081 | That 's or CDMA or whatever that 's uh ,"
[55:46] mn082 | Yeah .
"[55:48] mn081 | yeah ,"
[55:49] mn081 | probably a thing that has to be
[55:52] mn081 | find out . I don't know
"[55:53] mn081 | what statuses . Maybe they already did it par as part of UMTS , I 'm not sure ."
[55:58] mn081 | I don't have a clue .
[55:59] mn081 | I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet and on PS PPP over something
"[56:07] mn081 | and how it works like that , but on the wireless"
[56:09] mn081 | I 'm not sure .
[56:10] mn082 | Now what do you see about the
"[56:12] mn082 | um , um ,"
[56:15] mn082 | KPN
[56:16] mn082 | interests ?
"[56:17] mn082 | Because , I believe s"
[56:19] mn082 | if
[56:20] mn082 | the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar
"[56:25] mn082 | with uh the Multicast stuff ,"
"[56:28] mn082 | and KPN is very interesting in UMTS stuff ,"
[56:31] mn082 | and this is one
[56:33] mn082 | potential target
"[56:34] mn082 | network environment we are focusing on , but only for the uh"
"[56:38] mn082 | IP - layer technology ,"
"[56:40] mn082 | then , why do the mapping of multica also potential"
"[56:44] mn082 | mapping of Multicast , I think , must be of major interest for them . Right ?"
[56:49] mn021 | One question .
"[56:49] mn081 | Yes , but if if it 's available"
[56:52] mn081 | that means so so if uh
[56:54] mn081 | if it 's already part of the UMTS standardization
"[56:58] mn081 | then uh it 's immediately finished , like ,"
"[57:00] mn081 | OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ?"
[57:05] mn081 | And if it 's not in there yet
"[57:07] mn081 | well , it could be a suggestion and"
[57:10] mn081 | then the hardware people will
[57:12] mn081 | make it part u like the ETSI or whatever where U wherever UMTS is standardized
"[57:18] mn081 | they will d well ,"
[57:20] mn081 | go for it .
[57:21] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[57:21] mn081 | Of course , yeah , this this group could do that , too ."
[57:26] mn021 | I have a an important doubt about
[57:29] mn021 | the IP availability over UMTS .
[57:34] mn021 | you know that
[57:35] mn021 | the carriers and some manufacturers
[57:37] mn021 | have done an important effort
[57:39] mn021 | in developing
[57:40] mn021 | this web thing
[57:42] mn021 | and uh
[57:44] mn021 | I 'm not sure
[57:45] mn021 | what they plan to do with next
[57:50] mn021 | are they holding the same web technology ?
[57:57] mn021 | and forgetting about the thing ?
[57:59] mn021 | I I don't know what will happen .
"[58:01] mn021 | uh , I I don't have a clue . Probably ,"
[58:04] mn021 | if after
[58:05] mn021 | searching a little bit on the on the net
"[58:07] mn021 | I can get the answer , but"
[58:09] mn021 | initially
[58:11] mn021 | this is something to to to have in mind . I mean .
[58:14] mn021 | Because maybe
[58:16] mn021 | this UMTS thing will appear
[58:19] mn021 | on the market without IP as a native protocol .
[58:23] mn021 | And
[58:23] mn021 | if this is the case
"[58:25] mn021 | well , thus seamless integration could be"
[58:28] mn021 | we
[58:28] mn021 | strongly affected .
"[58:29] mn021 | At least , uh , if you we want to use U M T S ."
[58:35] mn021 | I 'm I 'm just uh
[58:37] mn021 | throwing the question .
"[58:38] mn021 | uh I mean ,"
[58:40] mn021 | looking for an answer because I don't know if uh some of you have
[58:45] mn021 | what
[58:46] mn021 | carriers are planning to do about this .
"[58:51] mn081 | I 'm not really sure ,"
[58:53] mn081 | but I thought I I had the impression that we can
[59:03] mn081 | let alone UMTS .
"[59:07] mn082 | Now , WAP is ja not only related now to available bandwidth . That 's not the only thing . It 's only the adaptation towards the"
[59:08] mn081 | That 's the impression I get .
[59:13] mn082 | capabilities of the end device .
[59:17] mn082 | Right ?
"[59:17] mn081 | Yeah , definitely ."
[59:18] mn082 | So .
[59:19] mn081 | But but still a le d it 's a it 's a fundamental
[59:22] mn082 | Huh .
[59:23] mn082 | Yeah .
[59:27] mn081 | the terminal has a WAP stick .
[59:30] mn081 | And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick .
[59:32] mn082 | So yeah .
"[59:33] mn081 | And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address ."
[59:38] mn081 | But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all . It 's l just a thirty - bit number
[59:41] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[59:43] mn081 | that a actually is an assigned number .
[59:45] mn081 | But it 's all only used for identification .
[59:47] mn081 | That 's the only thing .
"[59:48] mn081 | It 's stored in a WAP cookie ,"
[59:50] mn081 | much like HTP
[59:52] mn081 | in a cookie and from the WAP gateway
[59:54] mn081 | then it will be HTP real HTP or something .
[59:58] mn081 | So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection .
"[00:03] mn081 | It looks a little bit like uh the the well ,"
[00:09] mn081 | It 's not IP at all .
[00:11] mn082 | Right .
"[00:11] mn081 | Because there is a gateway , you can access with"
"[00:14] mn081 | almost the same microbrowser ,"
[00:16] mn081 | the same i uh web servers .
"[00:20] mn081 | If they provide the right content uh , spit out the right"
[00:24] mn081 | uh WML language .
[00:26] mn081 | So it 's it 's really a different network technology I think .
[00:30] mn082 | Yeah .
"[00:34] mn082 | Anyway , you have the gateway ."
[00:37] mn081 | Yeah .
[00:37] mn082 | The ca uh c uh t conversion of the media
"[00:41] mn082 | @ @ of the contents , in principle ."
"[00:46] mn082 | It 's too late , I believe ."
"[00:47] mn082 | If WAP was available in the beginning of GSM ,"
[00:50] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[00:51] mn082 | then I think it was there would be a good chance that it is
"[00:54] mn082 | well - deployed . But now , the first generation of"
[00:56] mn081 | I i
[00:56] mn082 | web - browsers are in the ha
"[00:57] mn082 | and and uh I would say "" handies "" , so that 's wrong in the mobile phones ,"
[01:02] mn082 | but
[01:02] mn082 | the the next generation of networks are still available .
[01:05] mn082 | and the ba uh the bandwidth constraints are no more
[01:09] mn082 | applicable ?
"[01:09] mn081 | Ri - right now there is still a lot of WAP , actually ."
[01:13] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:13] mn082 | Yeah , but The hype but"
[01:15] mn082 | uh
"[01:15] mn081 | Well , users usage ."
[01:16] mn082 | I never saw a user using WAP .
"[01:18] mn082 | Please raise your hand , who is using WAP ."
"[01:20] mn081 | My colleagues are . Yeah . Yeah , they are using WAP ."
[01:21] mn082 | Yeah ?
[01:22] mn082 | Yeah ?
"[01:24] mn082 | OK , one of six ."
[01:25] mn082 | So .
[01:28] mn081 | Yeah .
[01:29] mn081 | i
"[01:30] mn081 | Bu - well , you don't have a mobile phone in in the USA here ."
[01:34] mn021 | No . No .
[01:35] mn081 | So that 's maybe the reason . And I 'm not I doubt that it 's not available in Germany . It 's would be unbelievable to me .
[01:35] mn021 | Not me .
"[01:42] mn082 | Now , do you yeah , do you see the chance for WAP ?"
[01:44] mn082 | I don't see it .
[01:45] mn081 | It i it is . In in in Sweden it is also there .
"[01:48] mn081 | And in the Netherlands , it is also available ."
"[01:50] mn021 | In Spain it 's available but uh you know ,"
[01:53] mn021 | uh
[01:54] mn021 | my main complaint has been all the time
[01:57] mn021 | that it is difficult to me to believe
[02:00] mn021 | that I can do interesting work with a 4 lines display .
[02:06] mn081 | Oh .
"[02:11] mn081 | I 'm the first one to admit that 's a h that it is a hype ,"
[02:15] mn081 | but and but I 'm I just wanted to say it is being used .
"[02:19] mn081 | But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between ,"
[02:25] mn081 | no . I 'm not a supporter of it .
[02:27] mn021 | Huh - huh - huh .
"[02:27] mn081 | So they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ASCII bytes that can rescr refresh the screen with a different animation every , well , second , a few times ."
[02:40] mn082 | Yeah .
"[02:40] mn081 | So , that 's that 's true . I immediately agree ."
"[02:43] mn081 | But the thing was , y you just asked well , "" will will it be the same , will there be WAP for UMTS "" and so on , QPRS . And well I don't have the answer , but I thought it was not ."
[02:55] mn081 | I 'm just It 's weird it 's weird to stop doing it with GPRS .
[02:55] mn035 | Yeah .
[03:00] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[03:05] mn035 | is so general that it can be used with UMTS .
[03:08] mn035 | So if you still want to use
[03:10] mn035 | WAP
[03:11] mn035 | with UMTS you might be able to do it .
[03:14] mn035 | But
[03:14] mn081 | Yes .
"[03:17] mn081 | if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it , as a light stack or something . Yes ?"
[03:18] mn082 | Yeah .
[03:19] mn082 | Yeah .
[03:22] mn082 | Yep .
[03:24] mn081 | Sure .
[03:24] mn035 | But usually that 's not the reason to have UMTS .
[03:33] mn035 | Yep .
[03:34] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[03:39] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:40] mn082 | So maybe I would like to ask Claudia , you read the proposal in the meantime ?"
[03:40] mn081 | Hmm .
"[03:44] fn083 | Yeah , but the task changed really a lot , so , I 'd I rather would like to"
[03:44] mn082 | Yeah .
"[03:46] mn082 | Yes , that 's right ."
[03:48] mn082 | And do you have some comments on it
"[03:50] mn082 | from the next this is version zero dot five right , yeah ."
"[03:54] fn083 | Yeah , but I 'd rather like to follow the discussion"
"[03:57] fn083 | before I gave any comments , cuz it 's really"
"[04:00] fn083 | The first point is it 's much more than it was before I left , so it 's like five weeks in between , so it 's like that whew ! that big now ."
[04:07] mn082 | That 's right . Yeah .
"[04:07] fn083 | And it really changed a lot cuz the I mean I found the classroom inside but , the thing where I left the discussion was that we are talking about uh"
[04:17] fn083 | a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever . So .
"[04:34] fn083 | narrow than before so I 'd rather like to to follow it a bit , and then to get more into the ideas ."
[04:37] mn081 | So -
[04:42] mn082 | OK .
"[04:42] mn081 | c Can I do another one , like"
[04:45] mn081 | UMTS or wireless u i generally are will be m more expensive .
[04:52] mn081 | And especially UMTS . If they want to get back the money .
[05:02] mn081 | but at least the different application of protocol - based usage .
"[05:07] mn081 | So you have uh one connection , one application uses FTP whatever ,"
[05:14] mn081 | That those type of application you m may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something .
[05:23] mn082 | Also we want to go more in the triple - A
[05:25] mn082 | area .
[05:26] mn082 | Right ? Because billing alone
[05:27] mn081 | Or is n
"[05:29] mn082 | Or or ac um Billing is related to accounting , Accounting is related to Authentification and Authorization ."
[05:31] mn081 | e
"[05:32] mn081 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[05:36] mn082 | So . And then you are still at the triple - A service
"[05:39] mn081 | Yeah ,"
[05:40] mn081 | that 's right .
[05:41] mn082 | uh activity
[05:46] mn082 | has the skills to deal with that .
[05:48] mn082 | And then we are leaving our scope anyway .
[05:49] mn081 | OK .
[05:53] mn035 | My impression on this
[05:55] mn035 | proposal is that
"[05:58] mn035 | every single block has some research done already . So , multicast ."
[06:05] mn035 | This means that there are many things done .
"[06:08] mn035 | Oh , what was it ? Maybe I was routing mobility management"
[06:13] mn035 | But no one actually put them together .
[06:16] mn035 | But So that 's the big problem . But
"[06:18] mn035 | the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too big"
[06:22] mn035 | to put all these big pieces to
"[06:23] fn083 | What do you mean by "" put together "" ?"
"[06:25] mn082 | As it What I mean , the synergy effect , right ? From from Yeah ."
[06:27] mn035 | a complete scenario .
"[06:28] mn035 | You have ,"
[06:28] mn082 | Yeah .
[06:29] fn083 | Ah .
"[06:29] mn035 | in one scenario , multicast , quality of service , routing and mobile um networking ."
[06:37] fn083 | Mm - hmm .
[06:38] mn035 | Not just the islands alone .
"[06:38] fn083 | So why I wasn't ,"
"[06:40] fn083 | well , yeah , uh hold myself back a bit with comments , is"
"[06:44] fn083 | uh cuz when I left the discussion , the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point , here ."
[06:55] fn083 | And so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now . And there I had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing . Right ? Or wrong ?
"[07:07] mn082 | Yeah , in principle , it is related to the current state . But the networking stuff is more explained in much more detail"
"[07:11] fn083 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is . Of course ."
[07:14] mn082 | and the work packages are
[07:16] mn082 | better ident
[07:17] mn082 | oder what c
[07:18] mn082 | could be derived for work packages is much better aligned .
"[07:20] fn083 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . That 's that 's clear ."
"[07:21] mn082 | But that has not changed , yeah ?"
[07:22] fn083 | But -
"[07:23] fn083 | Yeah , that 's that 's clear , but then I don't get because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago ,"
"[07:31] fn083 | uh I had the impression that ,"
"[07:33] fn083 | you know , everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella ."
[07:40] fn083 | And now it sounds different . So that 's what I don't understand .
"[07:46] fn083 | Ah but , it 's also because I missed the last four weeks . So ."
"[07:52] fn083 | It 's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks , why it changed so ."
[07:55] mn082 | Yeah OK maybe one sentence one sentence . If you 're focussing on the argument chain as follows . I have an application .
[08:04] mn082 | This application has certain kind of requirements .
"[08:07] mn082 | These requirements are ,"
"[08:08] mn082 | maybe , Multicast and and and quality of service and mobility"
[08:17] mn082 | That is it . I want to focus on it .
[08:19] mn082 | Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind
[08:23] mn082 | that all other applications and all other networking stuff
[08:26] mn082 | is not affected by this .
"[08:28] mn082 | That you can use it with every application and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network ,"
"[08:33] mn082 | that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom ,"
"[08:38] mn082 | it must be fit end to end . And if you assume something , like we discussed it ,"
"[08:42] mn082 | very hard with with Multicast ,"
[08:44] mn082 | that you assume that Multicast will be available
[08:54] mn082 | all throughout of the internet .
"[08:56] mn082 | Otherwise it makes no sense ,"
[08:57] mn082 | and we
"[08:58] mn082 | come to the conclusion , "" OK ,"
"[09:00] mn082 | uh Multicast , we must deal with both approaches "" ,"
[09:03] mn082 | that you have eh application layer Multicast as well as maybe
[09:07] mn082 | some other Multicast and maybe
[09:09] mn082 | really Multicast @ @
[09:11] mn082 | and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have
[09:14] mn082 | not a certain kind of
[09:16] mn082 | access to the
[09:17] mn082 | server
[09:19] mn082 | elsewhere in the network
[09:21] mn082 | you want to use any application .
"[09:27] fn083 | So Cuz what 's difficult for me is what is meant by "" application "" ? So . Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining "" application "" in different way . So , what exactly is mean by "" application "" ?"
"[09:40] mn082 | The application , for instance , here ,"
[09:42] mn082 | that eh the
[09:44] mn082 | interactive classroom .
[09:45] mn082 | But elsewhere any application in in in any kind of
[09:45] fn083 | Yeah .
[09:51] mn082 | game server what - whatever kind of interactive multimedia
[09:55] mn082 | especially do uh downstreaming applications maybe eh video on demand
"[09:59] mn082 | then , eh"
[10:00] mn082 | whatever kind of application you can consider .
"[10:02] fn083 | So what has changed is that we 're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom , but on everything ."
[10:09] mn082 | Not on everything .
[10:11] mn082 | That 's not true .
[10:12] mn082 | But we s
[10:13] mn082 | That 's why we say
"[10:14] mn082 | here ,"
[10:15] mn082 | that we have a certain kind of eh possibility to change in the access networks .
[10:21] fn083 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:22] mn082 | That means the wireless networks because that provides , in principle , the mobility ."
[10:27] mn082 | And these mechan
[10:27] mn082 | And you see that there 's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks .
[10:33] mn082 | But the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network . You have to have in mind always the end to end scope .
"[10:43] mn082 | And if you see , for instance We have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things , u especially also for Multicast ,"
"[10:52] mn082 | different things really for different providers , and uh and it 's uh very easy to change it , maybe in the access network , for novel things ."
"[11:02] mn082 | For instance , that 's one provider domain and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain ?"
[11:07] mn082 | So it means that
[11:13] mn082 | It 's impossible
"[11:15] mn082 | to deal with that in the whole internet ,"
[11:17] mn082 | because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible . So how to combine these
"[11:23] mn082 | pos uh potential um extensions in the um access networks ,"
[11:30] mn082 | and without losing the end to end scope in the internet .
"[11:35] mn082 | Then you can have certain n novel features give the providers like KPN or whatever ,"
"[11:41] mn082 | the po the potential , in principle , to to uh"
"[11:53] mn082 | There will be a fifth generation , I 'm sure ."
"[12:00] mn082 | uh uh full I P , end to end ."
"[12:07] mn082 | because u you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet , using any application ."
[12:13] mn082 | And then this mechanism must fit it there .
"[12:15] mn082 | But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime , based on its success ,"
[12:19] mn082 | impossible to change .
"[12:21] mn082 | You see the difficulties with IP version six , eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast ."
"[12:26] mn082 | They are discussed since , you know , ten years or whatever ."
[12:29] mn082 | The specification are rather stable and and available but we have only islands in that . We cannot assume that everything is end to end available .
[12:38] mn082 | And so you have to mi to have to have in mind
"[12:44] mn082 | at a certain stage end to end available , maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other or the same applies for MPLS , for instance ,"
"[12:52] mn082 | maybe they are only portions available ,"
"[13:00] mn082 | But you have to select it because I have a mobile phone , a mobile node or whatever kind of device , and I want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet ."
[13:09] mn082 | So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with .
[13:18] mn082 | I always say that the success of internet make it unflexible .
[13:22] mn082 | It 's impossible to change something very easy .
[13:25] mn082 | s
[13:29] mn082 | So that is eh overall picture
[13:31] mn082 | that we have in mind with these things .
[13:33] mn082 | And we can not u
[13:35] mn082 | We we are six people
[13:36] mn082 | or seven or whatever
"[13:38] mn082 | if Hannes come ,"
[13:38] mn082 | We are not able to solve the problems
[13:41] mn082 | uh in in uh w in the few years or whatever
[13:45] mn082 | what the whole internet community has um
[13:49] mn082 | done in in si since uh since a decade .
[13:52] mn082 | But we can f pick up
[13:54] mn082 | some f some um potential and and and to start with something .
[14:00] mn082 | And that 's my missing point . That we
"[14:02] mn082 | have here , in principle , really the description of this problem I mentioned"
[14:06] mn082 | and focus really on the reasonable size of the project
"[14:10] mn082 | maybe in the first stage fo for the NSA core itself ,"
"[14:14] mn082 | and maybe possible extension from , for instance , if KPN say "" yes , that 's great , """
[14:25] mn082 | mmm University of Berlin or something and maybe University of Mannheim or Duisburg or in Spain oder whatever .
[14:31] mn082 | So if we have all the similar project
"[14:33] mn082 | then you have only to take care about that 's a little bit aligned ,"
[14:36] mn082 | that there 's some transparency concerning the results and
[14:39] mn082 | and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace .
[14:46] mn082 | So that 's the basic idea .
[14:48] mn082 | But really it 's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it .
"[14:53] mn082 | That 's the point . And if we get some funding back ,"
"[14:56] mn082 | and we have certain potent uh potential partners in the boat ,"
"[15:00] mn082 | OK , we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing , yeah ."
[15:01] mn021 | u
[15:04] mn021 | a a reasoning way .
"[15:07] mn021 | Uh let 's assume that we are successful with this proposal ,"
[15:11] mn021 | so we get the funding
[15:13] mn021 | to do
[15:14] mn021 | whatever what we want to do .
"[15:16] mn021 | So my question is , what we want to do is ?"
[15:20] mn021 | Let 's assume that we have the funding .
[15:22] mn021 | What will be our first and or or and second steps ?
"[15:30] mn021 | eh we will buy , what kind of things we will eh program or we will deploy ?"
[15:43] mn021 | know much better what the application we want .
"[15:49] mn082 | Yeah , but the problem is that f f f funding is the second step ."
"[15:54] mn081 | Well , I 'm not sure ."
[15:55] mn081 | I I th I think I agree with him .
[15:57] mn081 | But uh right now
[15:58] mn082 | Yeah .
[15:59] mn081 | we 're looking at b a th
[16:01] mn081 | You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing .
[16:04] mn081 | So if you
[16:05] mn081 | d
[16:10] mn081 | then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction .
"[16:14] mn081 | If you already assume "" well , OK , they paid money "" ,"
"[16:17] mn081 | and now you think , OK , what what great thing you want to do ,"
[16:21] mn081 | then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to m do .
"[16:27] mn082 | Yeah , but we have no eh current no public funding ,"
"[16:32] mn081 | No . But you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align KPN with Siemens , for instance ."
"[16:32] mn082 | OK , everybody 's paid here ."
[16:32] mn021 | Yeah .
[16:32] fn083 | Yeah .
[16:33] mn082 | Yeah .
[16:34] mn082 | Yeah .
"[16:37] mn035 | But for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question , "" if we would have the money what would we do with that ? """
[16:38] mn081 | Uh .
"[16:45] mn035 | So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money ,"
[16:48] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[16:49] mn035 | we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know .
[16:52] mn082 | That 's right . That 's right . Yeah . Yeah .
[16:52] mn021 | Absolutely .
"[16:54] mn035 | So that 's why , I think ,"
[16:55] mn082 | Yeah .
"[16:56] mn035 | yeah ,"
[16:56] mn035 | it 's a good question .
[16:59] mn035 | Yep .
"[17:00] mn082 | Yeah . I want to have really the activities you know ,"
[17:03] mn082 | what is really the outcome what is really the problem we are going to solve .
[17:07] mn082 | These are my questions .
[17:08] mn082 | And if we have identified this block
[17:11] mn082 | then it is possible to raise some money .
[17:13] mn082 | Yeah .
[17:15] mn035 | That 's just the same question just other way around .
"[17:24] mn021 | This is a PDA eh three com uh Palm Pilot compatible , nothing nothing that great , but it has some some possibility of being expanded ."
[17:37] mn021 | in here The only thing wireless thing I can put on on this
"[17:40] mn021 | is just uh this Omnisky modem ,"
"[17:44] mn021 | which is uh , I think it is a subscription - based uh thing ."
"[17:48] mn021 | You have to pay every every month ,"
"[17:51] mn021 | and eh of course ,"
"[17:53] mn021 | I cannot imagine that uh tomorrow I 'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks , four different providers on it ."
[18:03] mn021 | Maybe I 'm wrong but
"[18:05] mn021 | if I have the funding I say "" OK , well , I can buy this or even I can buy a mobile computer ,"
"[18:10] mn021 | a notebook "" ."
[18:11] mn021 | OK ?
"[18:12] mn021 | A lot more expensive , but that 's OK , I have the funding"
"[18:15] mn021 | Then I can add a couple of cards at most ,"
[18:18] mn021 | because mmm the majority of the of the notebooks only have two PC cards uh type two slots . So
"[18:27] mn021 | In in the better case , maybe I 'm only able to add two different networks to this thing ."
[18:34] mn021 | So ah
[18:38] mn021 | ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies
"[18:45] mn021 | um , maybe we are uh too advanced too , um , let 's say , uh too in advance for the current technology ."
"[18:55] mn021 | Which is not bad , but"
"[18:56] mn021 | uh , I 'm just saying that it will be"
[18:59] mn021 | able It will Sorry . It will be difficult for us
[19:02] mn021 | to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology .
"[19:06] mn021 | If somebody tell us , "" OK , now here you have the thing , and just put these four networks you want on the thing . "" How can I do it now ?"
[19:16] mn021 | So mmm
"[19:22] mn021 | you know , to get used to the uh all the ideas and to see that all the things are really connecting because this the eh most difficult thing I see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align ."
[19:40] mn021 | So that 's why I was proposing this this question .
[19:43] mn021 | Let 's assume we have the funding .
"[19:45] mn021 | Now let 's proceed . What what kind of things we can buy , we can put together , we can program ."
[19:51] mn021 | Because oh at the end uh
[19:59] mn021 | So .
[20:01] mn082 | It 's clear .
"[20:09] mn082 | Now from my point of view in the beginning ,"
"[20:12] mn082 | one more time , if I see the four building blocks ,"
"[20:16] mn082 | and eh I could speak only for my skills ,"
[20:19] mn082 | I believe to derive a certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance scheme
[20:24] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[20:26] mn082 | Much more uh general
"[20:31] mn082 | as it is done for for USAIA , but"
[20:34] mn082 | mapped then really to desired network
[20:37] mn082 | subnet layer technologies .
[20:39] mn021 | But for different networks ?
[20:39] mn082 | @ @
[20:41] mn082 | Yes .
"[20:44] mn082 | But first of all , a generic system , but because you can have several mechanism"
[20:49] mn082 | really using certain kind of of um
"[20:52] mn082 | um quantitative description ,"
"[20:55] mn082 | you can have more of a qualitative description ,"
"[20:59] mn082 | you can have taken into account moving patterns ,"
"[21:03] mn082 | whatever kind of things , but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of QS Reservation - in - Advance , and I see it as definitely is necessary to have this one"
[21:11] mn082 | if I want be mobile and I want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service . So .
[21:13] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[21:18] mn082 | Um
"[21:18] mn082 | But then , to go , for instance , to UMTS ,"
[21:22] mn082 | and figure out what is available within UMTS .
"[21:25] mn082 | And if I really have an IP application ,"
[21:28] mn082 | where I need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of QS will be available in the rest of the internet .
[21:36] mn082 | So how can I map these things uh to the UMTS stuff ?
[21:39] mn082 | And what is the trend towards UMTS to the first generation ?
[21:43] mn082 | And how it is possible to map this one to this technology ?
[21:47] mn082 | And if you have the building blocks
"[21:49] mn082 | identified ,"
"[21:50] mn082 | what is really necessary for QS eh QS - in - Advance for for mobile systems ,"
"[21:57] mn082 | then you have , in principle , the ideas for the following generation what you could improve ."
[22:01] mn021 | Hmm - hmm .
[22:03] mn082 | maybe no more related to this kind of thing .
[22:05] mn082 | I believe the same applies for Multicast .
[22:08] mn082 | And I believe the same applies for routing .
"[22:11] mn082 | So , in principle , in the beginning , there would be a certain kind of uh paperwork anyway ,"
"[22:17] mn082 | some theoretical examination of these problems ,"
[22:21] mn021 | I think so
[22:21] mn082 | and then some prototypes
[22:25] mn082 | must be derived from that . And then maybe we will start here with a certain kind of uh testbed equipment we still have here . We have four
"[22:34] mn082 | uh P Cs available . Maybe we have to extend it then ,"
"[22:37] mn082 | and figure out some real scenarios ,"
[22:40] mn021 | Oh yeah .
"[22:40] mn082 | Because uh , despite the fa"
"[22:42] mn082 | uh uh Hopefully , then we have"
[22:42] mn021 | W
"[22:43] mn082 | with the money also not eh only for the room , that would be great , but"
[22:47] mn082 | there are also some sponsors then then
[22:49] mn082 | then we add a certain kind of field trial .
"[22:53] mn082 | that 's years , you know ."
[22:54] mn082 | That 's years .
[22:55] mn021 | That 's right .
[22:56] mn082 | But in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework
[23:02] mn082 | with the relevant
[23:04] mn082 | technology .
"[23:06] mn082 | Real technology . Maybe you can start with GPS or or UMTS , or whatever ."
[23:10] mn082 | because these technology will definitely available in Europe .
"[23:14] mn082 | There 's some money spent on it , so that it will be in a certain kind of flavor ."
[23:19] mn082 | It will be available .
[23:19] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[23:20] mn082 | And it will be also available in the USA .
"[23:24] mn082 | Because there is a big eh harmonization effort ,"
"[23:27] mn082 | despite the fact they are not aligned to each other anyway , but they will have s also certain kind of thr third generation and fourth generation networks ."
"[23:36] mn082 | So . And after this theoretical framework , if this one is aligned , OK you have some specification and you set up some Linux or Free BSD or whatever kind of prototype ."
[23:45] mn082 | So that is what I have in mind with that .
"[23:50] mn082 | OK , and then you will see ."
[23:51] mn021 | Hmm - hmm .
[23:55] mn082 | The problem is which I see is that it could be
[23:59] mn082 | fruitful to standardization
[24:01] mn082 | that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers .
[24:10] mn082 | But there 's not a real product like you say .
[24:15] mn082 | There 's not the selling idea behind it .
[24:16] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[24:17] mn082 | Yeah , if you go with something what what Wilbert mentioned "" OK , let 's have this one here "" ."
[24:22] mn082 | We have a new PCMCIA card and and
"[24:25] mn082 | extend something and the end system , or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter - working in the end s ,"
[24:32] mn082 | then you have an an a device which you can sell .
[24:35] mn082 | If you go for a networking pfff um
"[24:38] mn082 | uh improvements , in principle , and and understanding next generation building blocks ,"
[24:44] mn082 | uh there 's no product .
[24:46] mn021 | Hmm - hmm .
"[24:50] mn082 | But it is a long term it 's long term , I think , uh work you can do ."
[24:56] mn082 | And it 's more related I believe to the skills
[24:59] mn082 | to what is available and and currently as I see what uh will be available within the NSA group .
[25:09] mn021 | OK .
"[25:09] mn082 | And uh , the point is if"
[25:11] mn082 | we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff
[25:16] mn082 | and em
"[25:18] mn082 | some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff ,"
"[25:23] mn082 | whatever this means ,"
"[25:24] mn082 | It might be we have then the active classroom , but it could be another one"
"[25:28] mn082 | that is not representative ,"
[25:31] mn082 | it 's only Hmm ?
[25:33] mn082 | Yeah . Then then is something available but
[25:39] mn082 | We have some content . We will then discuss it on next Tuesday as I mentioned .
[25:41] mn021 | Bless you .
[25:41] fn083 | Bless you .
"[25:43] mn082 | Uh Anyway , but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available ."
"[25:50] mn082 | The good thing is that the money is available , because everybody is paid here ."
[25:54] mn082 | So that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available .
[25:59] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[25:59] mn082 | But first of all Wilbert need more , definitely ,"
"[26:03] mn082 | because maybe then KPN is uh no more interesting to go on with this work ,"
"[26:07] mn082 | or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind ,"
[26:12] mn082 | uh companies like KPN .
[26:15] mn082 | So
[26:17] mn082 | And if we have other suggestions and eh have this as a long term
"[26:24] mn082 | NSA core group activity ,"
"[26:27] mn082 | and this theoretical framework , whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter , in principle , because"
[26:33] mn082 | the road map for the the next generation networks is is eh is for many years .
"[26:39] mn082 | And b before UMTS will be deployed very well , I believe eh it will be common t uh two thousand four or something like that ."
[26:48] mn082 | So .
"[26:50] mn082 | And and have an intermediate project , which is related in this direction , something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever ."
"[26:58] mn082 | This is a smaller portion in the gen more generic framework , I would like to say , from this proposal ."
[27:05] mn021 | OK
[27:05] mn082 | I don't know .
[27:06] mn082 | But uh that 's the point eh we are sitting here together .
[27:09] mn021 | Yeah .
"[27:13] mn082 | But for for Dietmar I think eh eh he mentioned it to me ,"
"[27:17] mn082 | it 's very clear that he will go on with a portion of time , with this USAIA stuff ,"
"[27:24] mn082 | in the matical sense because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent , you are decoupled from networking stuff ."
"[27:34] mn030 | Well , I 'm foc"
[27:38] mn082 | Yeah . Yeah .
[27:41] mn082 | Yeah .
[27:42] mn030 | I never eh e um dealed with um mobile communications . So why not ?
[27:49] mn082 | Yeah . So . There is it still ongoing activity
"[27:50] mn030 | So that 's eh , to open my mind ."
[27:53] mn082 | with uh maybe a portion of time at the University of Berlin Berlin .
"[27:57] mn082 | And independently whether I will leave the uh uh ICSI in in the mid of December or not ,"
[28:02] mn082 | I will still focus on on on these QS - in - Advance schemes
[28:08] mn082 | eh also within Siemens and also with some project there .
"[28:13] mn082 | And I believe your routing stuff is also available , uh ,"
[28:16] mn021 | Hmm - mmm .
"[28:18] mn082 | And when you when you will go back to Spain , right ?"
[28:19] mn021 | Yeah .
[28:21] mn021 | Yeah . Sure . Yeah . And and
"[28:22] mn082 | Yeah , so ."
"[28:23] mn082 | and and that 's why , in principle , the skills will be always available I guess ."
[28:23] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[28:23] mn021 | I 'm fortunate be
[28:28] mn082 | if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the
[28:34] mn021 | N Not only this . We can even use this u
[28:38] mn021 | to get some European projects in the future because
[28:41] mn082 | yeah
[28:43] mn082 | maybe
"[28:49] mn021 | I think w This will improve over time , I 'm sure ."
[28:54] mn021 | Probably .
"[28:55] mn021 | You know , this kind of joint work of different countries de companies , universities ."
[29:06] mn021 | Because it is involving different partners from different points of of Europe .
"[29:12] mn082 | Now , I will not prevent anybody from getting some cake and we are sitting here together it 's"
"[29:17] mn082 | uh very uh very slow , in principle , but my last question is for Wilbert ."
"[29:22] mn082 | Wilbert , you"
[29:24] mn082 | I I think you got the basic idea because it was mostly discussed with you here from this current available scrap project proposal .
[29:34] mn082 | Don't you think that KPN could be convinced to go on this way what I mentioned before ?
[29:39] mn082 | There 's no way ?
[29:39] mn081 | No .
"[29:41] mn082 | They needed definitely , in principle , some kind of service or device or product or whatever ."
[29:45] mn081 | Yeah .
[29:48] mn081 | That 's right now the s the status . Yes .
"[29:55] mn082 | Can we both have together ,"
"[29:57] mn082 | maybe , I think it 's a little bit more easier ,"
[29:59] mn082 | a discussion on Thursday ?
[30:04] mn081 | I 'm out for th one a week and a half .
"[30:08] mn081 | So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop at Stanford and next week I have a week on holiday ."
[30:09] mn082 | OK .
[30:14] mn082 | OK .
[30:15] mn082 | Maybe that 's enough time for you to consider a little bit more
[30:19] mn082 | in this direction ?
[30:20] mn081 | Could be .
[30:22] mn082 | And then we could have eh discussion and maybe
[30:26] mn082 | this one is an overall
[30:29] mn081 | Yeah .
"[30:30] mn082 | work , in principle , where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it"
[30:38] mn082 | and
[30:39] mn081 | for KPN would be that
[30:41] mn081 | there is a p a project in this area .
[30:44] mn081 | So that makes sense to do in this ar
"[30:47] mn081 | This ,"
[30:47] mn081 | I mean the Bay Area @ @
[30:49] mn021 | Hm - hmm .
"[30:50] mn081 | with a group of uh a few people , like four or something ,"
[30:54] mn081 | and that connects to this project .
"[30:56] mn081 | So , one somebody or two somebodies can be found uh founded or get money"
[31:02] mn081 | to join this project .
"[31:04] mn081 | But that the other four should build a service on top of it ,"
[31:08] mn082 | mm - hmm .
[31:08] mn081 | that has a clear business focus .
[31:10] mn081 | It means eh a a UMTS service basically .
[31:15] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:16] mn082 | Can you consider poten also in the meantime ,"
[31:20] mn082 | some potential UMTS services
[31:25] mn082 | besides this one ?
[31:25] mn081 | Yeah .
"[31:28] mn081 | Yeah , but"
[31:29] mn081 | you see the the they ask something pretty strange .
"[31:33] mn081 | They they want something pretty strange from me that I think of a service , a network service ."
[31:38] mn081 | There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day
[31:44] mn081 | and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start - ups or whatever .
"[31:49] mn081 | And just think of a service like that , if I could do this ."
"[31:53] mn082 | No , but , uh fff maybe based on this one and you see the networking stuff"
[31:54] mn081 | w
[31:59] mn081 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:01] mn082 | the core network technology in the access network , I would like to say . And this is aligned then"
"[32:07] mn082 | as much as possible to the internet . That 's the basic idea ,"
[32:10] mn082 | that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things .
[32:17] mn081 | Mm - hmm .
[32:18] mn082 | Because normally I I believe the the the people are
"[32:21] mn082 | either on the application layer ,"
"[32:22] mn082 | that means higher than layer four ,"
[32:23] mn082 | or they are on layer f one to l l up to layer four .
[32:27] mn081 | Bu -
"[32:27] mn082 | And the service people are considering "" OK , UMTS you have some location information , and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car ,"
"[32:36] mn082 | so , if I provide a certain kind of service , independently what the network is offering , you know ."
[32:41] mn082 | Because they do not consider it very well . They know there is a certain kind of location information
"[32:46] mn082 | and you have a GPS , and they know , OK , it 's based on satellite . And there 's UMTS , that is based on base station ."
"[32:52] mn082 | There 's all that they consider . And then assume , OK , I can do that ."
"[32:56] mn082 | And the networking guy said OK it would be great to have Multicast and all these kind of things in the network ,"
[33:01] mn082 | but do not consider really what a sense of benefit
"[33:04] mn082 | uh for applications , there were new app old application make use of it and how can new application arise"
[33:11] mn082 | which we
[33:12] mn082 | haven't considered up to now
"[33:17] mn082 | enriched network function , LAT ."
[33:24] mn082 | to consider something in that way
"[33:30] mn081 | Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it , but eh f to me u"
"[33:34] mn081 | what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by ,"
[33:40] mn081 | like the industry is already behind this .
[33:43] mn081 | So they they want to make this available pretty soon .
"[33:47] mn081 | So I 'm just trying to think uh m more ahead , like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something ."
"[33:57] mn081 | So so whenever you come in with your uh GSM phone and there is a PC available , like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something ."
[34:06] mn081 | So more services like that .
[34:07] mn081 | I think the they are working pretty hard to get IP available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices .
[34:23] mn082 | Not currently there is a techno technology split .
[34:23] mn081 | a th thing
[34:28] mn082 | Of course you have IP in the mobile device
[34:30] mn082 | but if you see the strange protocols text
"[34:33] mn082 | there 's IP over IP and tunnels and and whatever , so , but it 's uh"
"[34:36] mn082 | looks very strange to me because you have different numbering screens , concerning you have a phone number ,"
"[34:41] mn082 | you have to map it to IP addresses and and so on , but"
"[34:44] mn082 | for me , you have not the end to end parts of for for IP functionality ."
[34:48] mn082 | We are far away from that .
[34:51] mn082 | And if you take a really look to the GPRS protocols texts and I believe also they apply for UMTS but I 'm not
"[34:57] mn082 | eh very familiar with that ,"
[35:00] mn082 | and the next generations access network is will come soon .
[35:05] mn082 | You see it 's every three years or four years they will have a new generation .
[35:10] mn081 | And there 's a We m
[35:10] mn082 | But anyway you yeah ? yeah ?
[35:18] mn082 | Why ? What kind what kind IP over what do you call it ?
"[35:20] mn081 | N no nets ,"
[35:21] mn082 | No net .
[35:22] mn081 | Yeah .
[35:24] mn081 | Like only over ether .
[35:26] mn081 | carefully integrated for net but there is no net .
"[35:31] mn081 | If you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end IP available , that could be a vision ."
[35:37] mn081 | Like .
[35:43] mn082 | Can you repeat it ?
"[35:45] mn081 | Well , so he he says well IP to IP or end to end IP , is far well , it 's far away ."
[35:55] mn081 | um
[35:57] mn081 | So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there
[36:02] mn081 | and just do uh I Ps playing over radio .
[36:06] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[36:07] mn082 | Something like that is my final vision .
"[36:08] mn081 | Like like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM - WDM ."
[36:11] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[36:12] mn082 | @ @
"[36:13] mn081 | This gets rid of the SDH . Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first and then get rid of SDH ."
[36:15] mn082 | Yeah . ATM stuff . Yeah .
[36:16] mn082 | Yeah .
[36:17] mn082 | @ @
"[36:19] mn082 | There 's the problem is is , you see"
[36:21] mn082 | that the providers eh have always there broken view for for the management .
"[36:28] mn082 | If you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system , and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff , in principle , but you still need it ,"
[36:32] mn081 | Yeah .
[36:39] mn082 | is eh not aligned . We have it for different islands and and
[36:42] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[36:44] mn082 | @ @ Well , that 's my final vision you know ."
[36:47] mn082 | If you have really then IP networks at a certain generation
[36:50] mn082 | where you have really the physical media and where necessary
[36:54] mn082 | uh additional maclear
"[36:56] mn082 | protocols ,"
"[36:57] mn082 | and then you have really always end to end . It makes you things much more simple much more easier ,"
[37:02] mn021 | Uh .
"[37:02] mn082 | uh , but is far far away , you know . Yeah ."
"[37:04] mn021 | Unless unless we speak about quality of service ,"
[37:05] mn082 | Yeah .
[37:05] mn082 | Yeah .
[37:08] mn021 | which is not eh embedded on on IP services .
[37:12] mn082 | Yeah but you have the extension for the eh quality of service mechanism which you have to map then to the underlying technology .
[37:20] mn021 | Yeah but for example nobody 's really using RSVP .
[37:24] mn082 | Yeah but maybe in the LAN interface it makes since to use it
"[37:29] mn081 | Eh you guys do that discussion later on please , uh ? RSVP ."
"[37:30] mn082 | And and But yeah but I think we sh we will miss the cake and I think we should stop now but please everybody ,"
"[37:31] mn021 | OK , sorry , sorry ."
[37:37] mn082 | short
[37:38] mn082 | eh s
[37:39] mn082 | go on with considerations and potential and and uh
[37:43] mn082 | um we didn't make s
"[37:46] mn082 | much progress today in the meeting ,"
[37:48] mn082 | but anyway
"[37:49] mn082 | this kind of activity lives from all , from the input of all ."
[37:53] mn082 | And so I really
[37:55] mn082 | if somebody has an idea send an email and then I would like to
[38:00] mn082 | enforce everybody not that I 'm doing everything
[38:02] mn082 | I could not I f didn't have the time in the past and I will not have it in the future and
[38:07] mn082 | maybe I will stay here only s four weeks or five weeks .
[38:11] mn082 | So it would be really
[38:13] mn082 | not the best thing if the activity is dead when I am leaving
[38:17] mn082 | and if I stay longer of course we can go on but nevertheless I rely heavily
"[38:21] mn082 | uh also from the contributions of everybody , and it 's in their own interest"
[38:25] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm . That 's right .
"[38:25] mn082 | of of everybody , also from the institution behind . So"
"[38:29] mn082 | If there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever , we are s only a small group of people"
"[38:36] mn082 | we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion . It must not be on every Tuesday , you know ,"
[38:42] mn021 | OK .
[38:42] mn082 | at a certain time .
[38:44] mn082 | And I try to motivate the people . That it 's free . That 's a starting . That 's a ramp .
[38:48] mn082 | And we can go in different directions .
"[38:51] mn082 | And if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or UMTS or whatever , great ."
"[38:57] mn082 | If not , the long term and then these things must be , nevertheless must be defined in much more detail ."
[39:04] mn082 | Yeah .
[39:04] mn082 | OK ?
"[39:05] mn082 | So , thanks"
[39:05] mn021 | OK
[39:06] mn081 | OK
"[39:06] mn082 | please do not ,"
"[39:08] mn082 | um what Adam mentioned to uh switch off ,"
[39:11] fn083 | Do not Don't switch it off .
"[39:13] mn021 | OK , yeah , that 's right ."
"[39:16] mn021 | Oh , can you call Adam ?"
[39:19] mn021 | At this number ?

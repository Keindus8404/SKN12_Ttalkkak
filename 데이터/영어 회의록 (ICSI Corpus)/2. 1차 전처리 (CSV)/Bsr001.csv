"[00:13] fe016 | No , I mean , just like no one would know if something 's actually"
"[00:21] mn057 | Well , it 's being recorded anyway , right ? Why listen to the guy ?"
"[00:27] fe016 | Yeah , you just say , "" Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm "" ."
"[00:29] me055 | You need me , yeah ."
[00:30] mn057 | Then we can get Liz 's X marks later to see if there are any important things .
"[00:38] me025 | Oh , so ,"
[00:38] me011 | So .
[00:39] me055 | I really count .
[00:42] mn057 | Mine is on .
[00:44] mn057 | Where am I ?
[00:44] me025 | There 's a switch on top .
[00:45] mn057 | Which one ?
"[00:45] me011 | There 's a switch on top . So . "" On - off "" ."
[00:47] mn057 | Which one ?
[00:48] fe008 | Hello ?
[00:49] mn038 | This is on .
"[00:50] mn038 | Hi , hi , hi ."
"[00:52] mn057 | Channel Oh , I 'm on two . Good ."
[00:54] mn038 | Hello ? Hello ? I 'm I 'm on zero ! Yes !
[00:56] mn057 | You are on zero .
"[00:56] mn038 | Oh , uh I 'm being recorded by the wire ."
[00:57] me056 | Hello ?
[00:57] me011 | The the wireless ones are actually labeled .
[00:58] fe016 | Hello ?
[00:58] me025 | Yeah .
"[00:59] fe008 | I 'm on channel four ? Channel four , channel four , channel four ?"
"[01:01] mn057 | Oh , they 're already labeled ?"
[01:02] me011 | They have a little piece of tape .
[01:05] fe008 | Why ? That was good .
[01:05] me055 | And is that the channel number or the microphone number ?
"[01:06] mn057 | Well , I mean , you 're counting maybe from one instead of zero , so ."
[01:08] fe008 | Hey .
[01:09] me011 | Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number .
[01:10] fe008 | Hey .
[01:10] fe008 | Hey .
"[01:11] fe008 | You know , I have a feeling we 're on reversed . Does yours say "" three "" ?"
[01:11] me055 | Right .
[01:11] me056 | Right .
[01:11] mn057 | Right .
[01:12] me025 | Yeah .
[01:12] fe016 | And what about these ?
[01:12] mn038 | @ @ and Mike are coming on my channel .
[01:13] me011 | Or maybe add one .
"[01:13] me025 | No , no , no , no , no , no ."
"[01:15] me056 | No , no . You subtract He was just saying trap subtract one ."
[01:15] fe016 | Is it labeled ?
[01:15] fe008 | No ?
"[01:17] fe008 | Oh , thank you . Sss - this is the problem ."
[01:19] mn057 | Right .
"[01:20] fe008 | Good . OK , good , good , good ."
[01:22] fe008 | Thank you .
[01:25] me056 | Hmm .
[01:31] me011 | You look ni You look nine .
"[01:33] fe008 | Yeah , I 'm number three . That 's right . OK ."
"[01:35] mn057 | So , yeah ."
"[01:39] fe016 | Well , thank you ."
[01:40] fe016 | This is kinda fun .
"[01:45] me055 | Yeah , yeah ."
[01:47] fe016 | But it won't last long .
[01:47] mn057 | No !
[01:47] me025 | That 's right .
"[01:48] me011 | Yeah , so it 's r it 's remarkable how quickly people forget ."
[01:51] fe016 | Right .
"[01:52] me011 | So far , e"
[01:54] me055 | you can you can hear the shadow it creates .
[01:55] me055 | There was this like little acoustic shadow
"[01:57] me055 | from having this in front , yeah ."
[01:58] mn038 | Yeah ? Uh - huh .
[01:59] me056 | Uh .
"[02:00] me055 | Well , I can I can feel it ."
[02:03] fe016 | That 's amazing .
"[02:13] mn057 | So , Harry , we should maybe record some of your clicks and , you know ."
[02:16] me056 | I 've been clicking plenty .
[02:18] me056 | But they don't show up .
[02:18] mn038 | the sound effect man .
[02:21] me056 | They don't show up on that thing .
"[02:22] me011 | Well , I I bet they 're recorded"
[02:22] fe008 | Yeah .
"[02:24] me025 | Oh , yeah ."
[02:24] me011 | quite loudly .
[02:29] me056 | They tend to clip .
[02:30] me055 | Hmm .
"[02:32] me011 | That 's a nice user interface , Dan . Very what does "" solo "" mean ?"
"[02:35] me025 | Uh , it means I was trying to think of things they put on real mixers that I should have on mine ."
[02:42] me056 | Ahh .
"[02:43] me055 | feed it through the headphones , for example ."
"[02:44] me025 | cuz it 's actually you know , it 's it 's how to it 's what can I what application can I have for a for a , uh ,"
"[02:49] me025 | a class method rather or a class you know , a class procedure . So the solo by sa satellite . Then if you click on one of the other ones , it clears that one ."
[02:55] me055 | Hmm .
"[02:56] me011 | Oh , but it doesn't actually do anything else ?"
[02:56] mn038 | OK .
[02:59] me056 | So you 've implemented radio buttons .
[03:00] fe008 | It looks pretty slick though . That 's great .
[03:01] me025 | Yeah .
[03:02] fe008 | Ca - can can we fast forward through this conversation ?
"[03:07] me025 | Yeah , the uh ,"
[03:08] mn057 | Actually I think this thing is really cutting the blood flow . I 'm gonna pass out .
[03:09] fe008 | No .
"[03:17] me011 | Yeah , I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up ."
[03:22] me055 | Hmm .
"[03:22] me011 | I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it ."
[03:24] mn057 | Maybe this is a little better .
[03:26] fe008 | That 's really nice .
[03:27] mn057 | Boy !
"[03:28] mn038 | Clearly I mean , my impression is i if I have to wear this thing ,"
"[03:32] mn038 | you know , more than five minutes , uh , uh , uh , I mean , I I will be completely affected by it somehow ."
[03:38] mn038 | So .
[03:39] me011 | This this thing ? Or or just that one ? Yeah .
"[03:41] fe008 | I mean , on on the temple 's the pressure ?"
"[03:43] mn038 | They really press my temples , otherwise my ear channels , otherwise my joints here . I mean , depending where I put it , it press different things ,"
[03:44] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[03:45] fe016 | Oh yeah . That would give you a headache .
[03:46] me056 | What happened ?
[03:49] me055 | Mmm .
"[03:54] mn038 | Yeah . So , I mean , this this thing of course is"
"[03:55] me055 | Yes , that 's right . The medical ."
[03:58] me011 | Yeah .
"[04:02] me011 | Oh , yeah . But this is very comfortable . I mean , I I could wear this without any difficulty ."
[04:03] mn038 | Th -
[04:04] mn038 | Is it ?
"[04:05] fe016 | Can you convert these ear ones to something comfortable ? I mean , just by"
"[04:10] mn038 | But but there there I think , is a t you know ,"
[04:11] me011 | We c we 'd we 'd have to buy new ones .
[04:11] me055 | Mmm .
[04:12] me056 | Yeah .
[04:13] fe016 | Or j
"[04:14] fe016 | Yeah , I mean , you can just use the microphone and take the headband off ."
[04:16] me011 | The the other wa
"[04:17] me011 | the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear"
[04:21] me011 | and then you can adjust the other one .
[04:23] fe008 | Uh - oh .
[04:25] me011 | That doesn't work for you ?
[04:27] mn038 | No .
"[04:28] mn038 | A Anything which is distracting or painful , is going to impact negatively with this ."
[04:31] me055 | Mmm .
[04:33] me011 | So so you see how Jane 's wearing it ?
[04:33] me055 | Mmm .
[04:35] me011 | That seems to work OK too .
[04:36] mn038 | Yeah .
[04:36] me025 | Yeah .
[04:37] fe008 | It 's very comfortable .
[04:37] me011 | And you just have to bring it up .
"[04:38] mn057 | Yeah , go to that ."
"[04:41] me025 | Right , right ."
"[04:41] me011 | Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth ."
[04:46] mn038 | Hhh . OK .
[04:47] me011 | So .
"[04:49] mn038 | I mean , but probably this is designed in such a way that it should be closer . And this , eh , eh but this is designed to be worn like this to be worn like this ."
[04:53] me025 | Yeah . Yeah .
[04:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[04:56] me011 | Right . So .
"[04:57] me011 | Yeah , we maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement . If they 're eighty bucks ,"
[04:58] fe008 | Sure .
[05:01] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[05:02] me011 | that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable .
"[05:02] mn038 | I mean , I really like this . Uh I I mean , if I have to design the thing , uh I I would rather , you know , use this type of thing than the other ones ."
[05:10] fe008 | Wow .
[05:11] me056 | Just trying to give you a hard transcription task . No . I 'm sorry .
"[05:11] me011 | of course ,"
"[05:12] me011 | but to get to get a good quality I mean , if if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality ."
[05:12] mn038 | Yeah .
[05:13] mn038 | Yeah .
[05:15] mn038 | Yeah .
"[05:17] fe016 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[05:18] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , I noticed that . I noticed that ."
[05:18] fe008 | Do you s do you know Have you studied a click language ?
[05:19] me011 | So .
"[05:21] me056 | No , I wish . No ."
[05:23] fe008 | Wow .
[05:23] me056 | No . Just studied phonetics in general .
[05:23] me011 | Yeah .
"[05:24] fe016 | If it didn't if it didn't hurt , you know , if it was comfortable but you knew it was there , would it bother you ?"
[05:25] fe008 | OK .
[05:32] mn038 | OK .
[05:32] fe016 | Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional .
[05:33] me011 | Because I find this one doesn't bother me at all .
"[05:37] fe008 | I didn't know that you could whistle that You 're a very soft whistler , you 're mostly able to do that without much air at all , aren't you ?"
[05:38] mn038 | OK .
"[05:40] mn057 | Actually , I use something like this on on the telephone and it 's very comfortable ."
[05:40] fe016 | Yeah .
"[05:40] mn038 | I , uh ,"
"[05:40] mn038 | I , uh ,"
[05:40] me011 | I think you forget pretty quick .
"[05:42] fe016 | Your telephone , and people use it for cell phones and ."
"[05:43] mn038 | I mean , no ."
"[05:43] mn038 | I mean , no ."
[05:43] me025 | Yeah .
"[05:45] mn038 | Still , I I I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way ."
"[05:45] mn038 | Still , I I I mean , I 'm kind of more deaf on this ear , whatever this is on . Uh , I could wear it this way ."
[05:47] me056 | apical - alveolar kind of thing . I don't know . It 's You know ?
[05:48] me025 | Yeah .
[05:49] fe008 | OK . OK .
"[05:52] mn038 | I don't know , I feel distracted ."
"[05:52] mn038 | I don't know , I feel distracted ."
"[05:54] me025 | Yeah it is , yeah ."
"[05:56] fe008 | Oh , how fun !"
[06:00] me056 | No . Not too well . Yeah .
[06:00] fe008 | OK . OK .
"[06:01] fe008 | But they 're just very , very sensitive ."
[06:06] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[06:08] fe008 | Huh .
[06:13] me011 | And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous .
[06:13] mn038 | OK .
[06:17] mn038 | OK .
[06:19] mn038 | OK .
[06:19] fe016 | I think you can't do any research otherwise .
"[06:21] me011 | Yeah , I agree ."
[06:23] me011 | Training s Training speech recognition systems .
[06:23] fe016 | It 's too hard .
[06:26] me055 | Right . But it will train them to the microphone characteristics of this c
[06:26] fe016 | I think you should collect both simultaneously .
[06:29] me011 | We wanna do both . So so the the point is that
[06:30] me055 | Right .
[06:32] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:32] me011 | if you if we try ,"
"[06:34] me011 | from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything ."
"[06:36] fe016 | Yeah , forget it ."
[06:37] me055 | Yeah . Yeah . Absolutely . I agree . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[06:37] me011 | You won't be able to align . You won't be able to segment . You won't be able to do anything .
[06:37] mn038 | Yeah .
[06:38] fe016 | You won't be able to get grants .
[06:41] fe016 | You won't be able to get funding .
"[06:43] fe016 | No , I 'm serious ."
[06:44] me055 | Yeah .
"[06:44] fe016 | I mean , you won't be able to show any results ."
[06:46] me055 | Mmm .
[06:46] fe016 | So .
[06:47] me025 | I mean th
"[06:51] me011 | Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad ,"
[06:53] fe016 | It was pretty bad .
[06:55] mn038 | Yeah . Yeah .
[06:56] fe016 | It takes off quite a lot .
[06:57] me011 | whereas these are m are
"[06:59] mn057 | Well , yeah , I mean , that 's really like having one of these almost , so ."
"[07:01] me011 | That 's why if you if you use DragonDictate or or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these . There 's just no other way around it ."
[07:02] me055 | Hmm .
"[07:04] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[07:06] me055 | Hmm .
[07:06] mn038 | Yeah .
[07:11] fe016 | there are too many applications to for them not to not do that .
[07:12] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:14] fe016 | I mean , it may not look like this but ."
[07:18] fe016 | Yeah .
[07:20] me025 | Yeah it 's y
[07:20] me011 | a little bit of audio a a little bit of audio
"[07:21] fe016 | Yeah , this one 's fine ."
"[07:24] me011 | degradation in one ear ,"
"[07:25] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[07:25] fe016 | Right .
"[07:25] me011 | and I get a little bit of peripheral vision , but other than that ,"
[07:27] me025 | Yeah .
[07:28] me055 | Hmm .
[07:29] me011 | it 's not bad at all .
"[07:30] me011 | Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable ."
[07:30] fe016 | I
"[07:32] mn038 | Yeah , those are really"
[07:33] me011 | So .
[07:34] mn038 | bad .
[07:41] me055 | U i
[07:41] me055 | It must have numbed the areas .
"[07:44] me011 | you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version ."
[07:45] fe016 | Yeah .
"[07:48] me025 | No , we got a Japanese version , you know that 's that 's it , yeah ."
[07:50] fe016 | Sorry .
"[07:50] mn038 | And so and what about this one ? I mean , this thing wearing sideway that that can ?"
[07:53] me011 | It 's wired .
"[07:58] me025 | from you know , the fact this thing 's stuck in your ear ."
"[08:01] fe016 | Oh , this would drive me crazy . I absolutely people are very picky about this ."
[08:01] me055 | Mmm .
[08:02] mn038 | Oh .
[08:05] me056 | Mmm .
"[08:05] me025 | Oh yeah , it does ."
"[08:06] me025 | When I bought those things I originally got this version , cuz Plantronics makes uh you know , an in - the - ear one ."
[08:07] mn038 | Uh Uh - huh .
[08:10] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:12] me025 | And I really liked it but , other people didn't . So it just depends . I guess , you know , I 've"
"[08:16] me025 | been using in - the - ear Walkman headphones , for you know , a long time , so I 'm kind of used to that weird sensation having something stuck in my ear ."
[08:19] mn038 | Yeah .
[08:19] me055 | Mmm .
"[08:24] me011 | Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these , so I 'm used to this ."
[08:29] mn038 | You do .
"[08:30] me011 | I don't use it anymore . Uh , my hands got better so I stopped using it . But , uh ."
[08:30] mn038 | Y
[08:31] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[08:33] mn038 | OK .
"[08:35] me011 | So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking"
[08:38] mn038 | OK .
[08:39] me011 | to do all my work .
[08:42] me011 | Yeah .
[08:42] mn057 | Yeah ?
[08:43] me011 | It was really a pain .
[08:44] me055 | Code ! Right .
"[08:44] me011 | Yeah , but I didn't have a choice . I mean , I couldn't type . So ,"
[08:45] mn057 | Wow .
[08:46] me055 | That 's an interesting language model I 'm sure .
[08:47] mn057 | Uh .
[08:48] mn057 | Huh .
[08:48] me011 | uh .
[08:50] me011 | Yeah .
[08:51] me025 | Right .
[08:51] me055 | Mmm .
"[08:51] fe008 | Mm - hmm , yeah ."
"[08:52] me011 | In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on , "" voice environments for programmers "" , but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better . So"
[09:00] me011 | that 's how I ended up working on this project instead .
[09:00] me025 | Hmm .
[09:03] fe016 | Huh .
[09:05] mn038 | Good .
"[09:09] me025 | So , yeah . I don't know ."
[09:10] me025 | Yeah .
"[09:12] mn038 | Well , basically ,"
"[09:14] mn038 | the the the original project looks a lot like , you know , the the p your project . I mean , basically we set up with this , uh ,"
[09:23] mn038 | idea of
"[09:24] mn038 | the the the meeting the the mediated spaces idea in general and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting , and will be like two kind of"
[09:28] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:40] mn038 | eh , f main functions . One"
"[09:42] mn038 | is the interaction with the computer which , as you said , you know , is your interaction with the PDA in your case ,"
[09:44] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:48] mn038 | where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera . At the same time ,"
[09:49] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:52] mn038 | our process is somehow ,"
"[09:54] mn038 | you know , getting all this multi - channel information ,"
"[09:57] mn038 | doing some sort of , you know ,"
"[09:59] mn038 | cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and"
[10:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[10:02] me055 | Mmm .
"[10:05] mn038 | transcribing the individual streams ,"
[10:08] mn038 | not necessarily in real time .
[10:10] mn038 | And the idea is y you can eventually after the meeting
[10:14] me011 | Right .
"[10:15] mn038 | and there is all this work on transcription ,"
[10:18] mn038 | similar probably to what we do in Switchboard but with
[10:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:22] mn038 | better bandwidth ,"
"[10:25] mn038 | you know , environmental conditions ."
[10:26] me011 | Worse acoustics . Yeah .
"[10:27] mn038 | An - and then ,"
"[10:28] mn038 | you know , there is , all all these issues about"
"[10:31] mn038 | processing all this information , you know ,"
[10:32] me011 | Mmm .
"[10:33] mn038 | transcription , but then using , you know , prosody information to better , you know , segment , endpoint ."
"[10:40] mn038 | Eh , also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information ."
[10:43] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:48] mn038 | I mean ,"
[10:52] me055 | I 'm beginning to feel my heart beat now .
[10:55] mn038 | That that was daring .
"[10:56] me011 | The PDA one is very , very ambitious . And it 's also it 's depending on"
[10:59] mn038 | Yeah .
[10:59] me055 | Mmm .
[11:01] me011 | not only
"[11:02] me011 | that Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM"
[11:04] mn057 | Hmm . Mmm .
"[11:04] me011 | taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms which is non - trivial ."
[11:05] mn038 | Yeah .
[11:06] mn038 | Yeah .
[11:10] mn038 | Yeah .
[11:11] mn038 | Yeah .
[11:12] me011 | So .
[11:12] mn038 | Yeah .
"[11:14] mn038 | But , you know , uh let 's assume somehow the compu"
[11:17] mn038 | processor power is going to be there .
[11:23] me055 | Mmm .
[11:24] me025 | Right .
"[11:25] me011 | our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link ,"
[11:26] mn038 | Yeah .
[11:30] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[11:30] me011 | right ? You 'll dump the the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere
[11:32] mn038 | Yeah .
"[11:33] mn038 | Yeah . I I mean , ou uh we we kind of set up this concept like"
[11:34] me011 | and you 'll do the recognition .
[11:35] me055 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:38] mn038 | a year and a half ago . And at that time I said ,"
[11:39] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:40] mn038 | you know , we said ,"
"[11:41] mn038 | "" don't worry about the the compute power "" . I mean , it will be somewhere , you know ."
[11:45] me011 | Hmm .
[11:45] me025 | Yeah .
"[11:46] me011 | Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it and I think"
[11:48] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[11:49] me011 | maybe I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue . My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad .
"[11:57] me011 | And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else ."
[11:59] mn038 | Yeah .
"[12:02] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:02] me011 | Um , the too many things to cont"
[12:04] me011 | can go wrong and you lack control .
[12:05] mn038 | Yeah .
[12:07] mn038 | Yeah .
[12:07] me011 | I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself .
"[12:10] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:11] me011 | And so the IRAM project provided us a method of
[12:14] me011 | having a very powerful thing in your hand .
[12:17] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[12:17] me011 | And so we wanna see what we can do with it but
[12:19] me011 | we 'd also don't want the project to actually
[12:22] me011 | completely depend on it .
"[12:23] me011 | So ,"
[12:24] mn038 | Yeah .
[12:24] me011 | the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not .
"[12:27] mn038 | I mean , our approach , somehow , I mean ,"
"[12:30] mn038 | I believe it 's probably , you know , complimentary in many ways ,"
[12:33] mn038 | is to focus on the actual deep technology
"[12:37] mn038 | that we have somehow in speech . And basically ,"
[12:39] me011 | Right .
"[12:40] mn038 | make progress on , you know , the algorithms . And then , you know , it will run somewhere . I mean ,"
[12:46] me011 | So w
[12:49] mn038 | but our focus is
"[12:50] mn038 | basically to develop the algorithms , to"
[12:52] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[12:52] mn038 | push the state of the art
[12:54] mn038 | on this transcription task .
"[12:57] mn038 | And , uh , the other task"
"[12:58] mn038 | probably is also , you know , challenging the comp"
[12:59] me011 | So a
[13:00] me011 | Right .
"[13:01] mn038 | the the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language ."
[13:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[13:06] me011 | the Meeting Recorder project
[13:08] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[13:08] me011 | has a very similar
[13:09] mn038 | Uh - huh .
"[13:10] me011 | uh , approach ."
"[13:11] me011 | Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing"
[13:15] me011 | how much speech recognition can I do on this little
[13:18] me011 | unit .
"[13:18] mn038 | Oh . I see . You really are challenged to do that ,"
[13:21] me011 | Yep .
[13:22] mn038 | to put as much power as you can in the PDA .
[13:24] me011 | Yep .
"[13:25] mn038 | OK , uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary"
[13:28] mn038 | to do it
"[13:29] mn038 | and , you know , some of it may go into something ,"
"[13:32] mn038 | depending on , you know , your scalable power ."
"[13:35] me011 | As I said , the Meeting Recorder project , so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations . They won't be running on IRAM ."
[13:38] mn038 | Yeah .
[13:43] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[13:43] me011 | And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM .
[13:46] mn038 | OK .
[13:46] me055 | Hmm .
[13:46] me025 | Mmm .
"[13:47] mn038 | Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this"
"[13:50] mn038 | you know , sc eh ,"
"[13:52] mn038 | higher and higher , you know ,"
[13:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[13:54] mn038 | powers in these portable things .
[13:55] me025 | Yeah .
[13:56] mn038 | So as long as you have
[13:57] mn038 | enough
[13:58] mn038 | algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power .
[14:02] me011 | Right .
"[14:02] mn038 | I mean ,"
"[14:03] mn038 | the the situation now in the speech community is that ,"
"[14:06] mn038 | you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the"
"[14:09] mn038 | performance . And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get"
"[14:11] me011 | That 's right , we don't even know what to do with it . We don't need to n"
[14:13] mn038 | any better . And so we are trying to push that .
[14:13] me055 | Mmm .
[14:14] me011 | Right .
[14:16] me011 | Yeah .
"[14:16] mn038 | And then you have room to port whatever you can to , you know , smaller devices ."
[14:19] me011 | Yep .
"[14:20] me055 | You get the wrong answer quicker basically , don't you ? Yeah ."
"[14:20] me011 | Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles ."
[14:24] mn038 | Sorry I interrupt you .
[14:25] me011 | We w
"[14:27] me025 | I was gonna say that ,"
"[14:28] me025 | um , you know , in terms So , Adam has a you know , a particular agenda ,"
"[14:32] me025 | um , but obviously there are lots of other things . And you know , it 's the way that a project like this works so that"
[14:32] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:37] me025 | a group like this where we have students coming in , you know It 's it 's meant to be sort of a long term thing that"
[14:42] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:42] me025 | will get us data and people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it . So it 's not clear , you know , whether s someone at UW 's gonna look at , um , beam - forming or whatever ."
"[14:51] me025 | But , you know ,"
"[14:52] me025 | it 's goo it 's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it , and so it 's We we haven't thought it through ."
[14:55] me055 | Hmm .
[14:55] mn038 | Yeah . Always @ @ .
"[14:57] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[14:58] me025 | But that 's OK , you know , it 's kind of it 's fair enough ."
[14:59] mn038 | Yeah .
"[14:59] me011 | As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection ."
[15:02] me025 | Yeah .
[15:03] mn038 | Huh .
"[15:03] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[15:04] me011 | And he has a very good system for that and and he wants to use this corpus .
[15:06] mn038 | Yeah .
[15:06] mn038 | Yeah .
[15:08] me055 | Mmm .
"[15:08] mn038 | Exactly . I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID . I mean ,"
[15:08] me011 | So .
[15:10] me011 | Yeah .
[15:11] me055 | Mmm .
[15:12] mn057 | Mm - hmm .
[15:13] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:14] mn038 | you want to know . I mean , if you have the people wired individually it probably is easier ."
"[15:18] mn038 | But but you know , in in the other situation , you know ."
"[15:21] me011 | What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline ."
[15:23] mn038 | Yeah .
[15:26] mn038 | Yeah .
"[15:26] me011 | Right ? You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer ,"
[15:26] me025 | Yeah .
[15:26] me055 | Hmm .
[15:29] me025 | You can get the ground truth . Yeah .
[15:29] mn038 | Yeah .
"[15:30] me011 | to ground truth very easily and then you can degrade it by using the P Z Ms , you can degrade it further by using those things ."
"[15:33] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
[15:34] me055 | Mmm .
"[15:36] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[15:37] me011 | And and really see what you can do with a real system . So .
"[15:39] mn057 | Yeah , for example , when you go to your PDA system it 's , uh , really an awful open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns , uh ."
[15:45] me011 | That 's right .
[15:46] me055 | Mmm .
[15:47] me025 | Yeah .
[15:48] me011 | That 's right .
"[15:49] mn057 | That 's actually being ad That 's one of the problems that 's being addressed at this year 's evaluation , uh ,"
[15:53] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:53] me011 | Oh , really ? They 're doing"
"[15:54] mn057 | which is taking place right now , actually ."
[15:54] fe008 | Mmm .
[15:55] me011 | an unknown number ?
[15:57] mn057 | Right . You you do need to figure out the number of speakers in the waveform .
[15:57] me011 | That 's good .
[16:00] me055 | Right .
[16:01] mn057 | This is a NIST evaluation . Um .
[16:03] me025 | Of the speaker ID or something ?
[16:03] me055 | This i
"[16:04] mn057 | Eh , right , speaker verification ."
[16:05] me025 | And what 's the what wha So what has the data been ?
"[16:09] mn057 | Uh , Switchboard ."
"[16:10] me025 | Oh , OK ."
"[16:16] mn057 | We will also run so some part of that , uh , evaluation too but probably not that segmentation part ."
[16:22] mn057 | But I don't know if they are using a
"[16:24] mn057 | different data for that . But I mean , it 's s"
"[16:27] mn057 | While I say "" Switchboard "" , s eh , of course there 's only two speakers ."
[16:30] me025 | Yeah .
"[16:30] mn057 | But , um , I don't know how they , uh , actually went about . Um ."
"[16:40] mn057 | maybe some other data for that part , you 're right ."
[16:41] me025 | Uh - huh .
"[16:43] me011 | I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different ."
"[16:45] mn057 | No , no ."
[16:46] me055 | Mmm .
[16:47] mn057 | Yeah .
"[16:48] me011 | So , uh , what we what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News ."
[16:49] mn057 | Right .
[16:59] me011 | they were parts that were interviews
[17:01] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:01] me011 | that he worked on . And , uh ."
"[17:03] mn057 | No . We 've also , uh , s done some of that as , uh , eh ,"
[17:04] me011 | Right .
"[17:07] mn057 | um , I mean , I have a so small , uh , hacked up system which sort of , for for the Broadcast News determines the approximate number of speakers and actually assigns some names to them ."
[17:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[17:15] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:17] mn057 | This is something we did for the MAESTRO project , uh , for for Rick ."
[17:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:22] mn057 | But , um , uh ,"
"[17:24] mn057 | yeah , uh , for for Broadcast News it works much better actually . It 's , uh ,"
"[17:28] me011 | Yeah , he had he got very good results ."
[17:32] me011 | Right .
[17:32] me011 | Right .
"[17:34] me011 | Yeah , so I I tried his"
"[17:36] me011 | on his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff ,"
"[17:39] me011 | um , but of course we don't have any trained"
[17:44] me011 | So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system
[17:47] me055 | Hmm .
[17:47] me011 | that we use for speech recognition .
"[17:49] me011 | And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on"
[17:52] me011 | this data .
[17:53] mn038 | Hmm .
[17:55] me011 | didn't do t tremendously well .
"[17:57] me011 | And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well , his algorithm ."
"[18:00] fe016 | Yeah , I mean Broadcast News is for this third - party listener , right ?"
[18:02] me011 | Hmm ?
[18:04] me011 | Right .
[18:04] me025 | Right .
"[18:04] fe016 | So they , you know if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this , you know , you 'd turn off your radio ."
[18:11] me055 | Yes .
"[18:12] me011 | That 's right , with all the i interrupts ."
[18:12] me025 | Right .
[18:12] fe016 | So it 's just got a d it 's a lot easier .
[18:14] me011 | Yes .
"[18:22] mn038 | something like this from , you know , public"
[18:24] mn038 | cast uh w eh eh .
[18:25] fe008 | There are there are some with a lot of overlap . Yeah .
"[18:27] mn038 | Um uh yeah , and they but they they do it somehow ."
[18:29] mn038 | They clean it up . I notice that they they s
[18:32] mn038 | they sa have some help with control of
"[18:34] me011 | Mixing , yeah ."
[18:34] mn038 | what person to pick up .
[18:36] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:37] mn038 | I I mean there is some program at midnight somewhere . It 's a bunch of , like , four people discussing and they , it 's a lot clean ."
[18:43] me011 | Like McLaughlin.
"[18:45] mn038 | Yeah . I yeah , probably ."
[18:45] fe008 | But the but the worst the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all . And and it 's hard to even follow what they 're saying . It 's just it 's truly totally overlapped .
[18:50] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[18:53] me055 | Right .
"[18:53] mn038 | Yeah . Uh , yeah . I 've heard that that that sometimes . But it 's it 's OK , though ."
[18:54] me055 | Yeah .
"[18:57] me055 | It 's still in the forma it 's still in the format which is slightly more formal I think than , you know ,"
[19:02] me055 | completely informal conversational speech .
[19:02] fe008 | OK .
[19:03] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:04] me011 | Oh , I 'm sure they do . They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back ."
"[19:05] me055 | They will do , a bit . Yeah ."
"[19:09] fe008 | OK , you guys are more in business that I am ."
"[19:11] mn038 | it 's still , you know , understandable ."
[19:11] me025 | But it @ @ bu
"[19:12] me055 | The host probably gets , uh , you know gets a little bit more ."
[19:14] me025 | Yeah .
"[19:15] fe008 | My feeling is that when I when I when I 've seen that show it 's like there there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor and other people are trying to get in , and they can never never get access ."
"[19:22] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[19:24] mn038 | Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[19:25] fe008 | It depends very much on the mix .
"[19:25] me011 | Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters ."
"[19:30] fe008 | Yeah , it 's just , I I know that there are periods where two people are talking in t at the same time and you 're only able to hear"
[19:30] me011 | Right ?
"[19:33] mn038 | At the same time . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[19:36] fe008 | um , parts of the weaker voice ."
"[19:39] fe008 | And , you know , that 's It 's a style . It 's a style . Uh , but I but I 've seen debates where And you know it 's apparently engaging people . Uh , it 's been going on for a while now ."
[19:39] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[19:41] me055 | Uh - huh .
"[19:41] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[19:43] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:47] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
[19:49] fe008 | Yeah .
[19:55] fe008 | Sure . Absolutely . Yeah .
"[20:00] fe008 | Or in New York or in New York , high involve high in high involvement style ."
"[20:03] mn038 | Yeah . I mean , could be reassuring , you know ? Keep going , keep going ."
[20:03] fe016 | Right .
[20:04] me055 | Hmm .
[20:04] fe008 | Yeah .
[20:04] me011 | High involvement . That 's that 's a
[20:06] fe008 | Yeah .
[20:07] fe008 | That 's what it 's called . Yeah .
[20:13] me011 | So what do we do ?
"[20:17] mn038 | Well , I mean ,"
"[20:18] me011 | It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects , so it would be nice to work together ."
[20:19] mn038 | I I belie I believe there is a lot of overlap and would be great to com to to
"[20:24] mn038 | basically take advantage of that to to make a synergy more than an overlap , and , you know , help each other ."
[20:27] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[20:27] me055 | Hmm .
"[20:30] mn038 | I I believe each group has , you know , depths"
"[20:33] mn038 | in in different , uh , areas , so ."
"[20:36] mn038 | I mean , we clearly"
[20:38] me055 | Hmm .
[20:39] mn038 | c should collaborate
[20:40] me011 | So is your intention
[20:40] mn038 | for the best of everybody .
[20:41] me011 | to start collecting some meeting data ?
"[20:45] mn038 | Uh ,"
"[20:48] mn038 | There are no final I mean , the official decisions I guess"
[20:50] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[20:52] mn038 | have to be made
"[20:53] mn038 | in terms of resources to that . My personal opinion , if you ask , is that we should because"
"[21:02] mn038 | No , no , no . Um , you need a task"
[21:05] me011 | Oh .
"[21:06] mn038 | to really , you know , improve your system"
[21:08] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[21:09] mn038 | for that particular environment . So right now we are focusing our research
"[21:13] mn038 | on doing evaluation type of , you know ,"
[21:17] mn038 | in incremental
"[21:19] mn038 | you know , improvements ."
"[21:20] mn038 | So ,"
"[21:22] mn038 | Switchboard , for instance . They have five is kind of OK , you have two people talking , it 's the closest thing . But"
"[21:27] mn038 | we really should move into the you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real"
[21:33] mn038 | scenario .
[21:33] me055 | Hmm .
[21:34] mn038 | And that that 's a way to improve . And then you do improvement on that particular database .
[21:34] me011 | Right .
[21:35] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:39] mn038 | So even if we don't collect the data to train models ,"
[21:42] mn038 | we should collect data at least to evaluate progress .
"[21:45] me011 | So what would be nice is if we could ,"
[21:50] mn038 | Yeah .
[21:50] fe016 | Yeah .
[21:51] me055 | Hmm .
[21:51] mn038 | Yeah .
"[21:52] fe016 | And and software too . I mean , things like rewriting this Transcriber tool and thi that That shouldn't be re redone ."
[21:52] me055 | I think that 's the op
[21:54] mn038 | Yeah .
[21:54] me055 | Yeah .
[21:56] me011 | Right .
[21:56] mn038 | Yeah .
[21:57] me025 | Right .
[21:58] mn038 | Yeah .
[21:58] me055 | Hmm .
[21:59] me056 | You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to you might contract out to do the transcription ?
[22:06] me056 | Can y
"[22:08] me056 | Yeah , that 's what I was wondering . OK ."
[22:10] me011 | there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us
[22:15] mn038 | Uh - huh ?
[22:15] me011 | in exchange for the corpus .
[22:17] me055 | Is that in exchange for access to the c
"[22:19] me011 | Right ,"
[22:19] me055 | Right .
[22:19] mn038 | Yeah .
"[22:19] mn038 | So , on one question . I mean , uh , this this thing is also for you ,"
"[22:23] mn038 | made on internal funding ? Or I mean , I know you 're applying for some DARPA funding ."
[22:27] me011 | We have a little bit of DARPA .
"[22:29] mn038 | Oh , you already got some ."
"[22:29] me011 | Uh , under the communicator project ."
[22:30] mn038 | OK . OK .
"[22:31] me011 | So so that 's part of it . And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group ."
[22:35] mn038 | OK .
"[22:35] me011 | IRAM group is paying for part of it . And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds ,"
[22:39] mn038 | OK .
[22:40] me011 | is paying for it as well .
"[22:40] me055 | And you 're saying some of the infrastructure is , um , the A T - andT video conferencing ."
"[22:43] me011 | The infrastructure , yeah , they th they were paid but they don't expect anything in return . They 're just being very nice and"
[22:45] me055 | Yeah .
[22:47] me055 | Right .
[22:48] me055 | So pi
[22:49] me055 | A free gift . Yeah .
[22:51] me011 | and so they they basically wanted stuff anyway . And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed .
[22:52] mn038 | OK .
[22:54] me055 | Hmm .
[22:56] mn038 | Yeah .
[22:59] me055 | Right .
[22:59] me011 | So .
"[23:00] fe016 | And then , uh , UW I don't know if you mentioned this"
"[23:02] fe016 | at the beginning but ,"
"[23:03] fe016 | the Mari 's group ,"
"[23:05] fe016 | Mari and Morgan I th I think what happened historically , um Oh , I don't know how much I 'm supposed to say if this is being recorded ."
[23:12] me055 | Should we stop recording ?
[23:12] mn038 | You are on the line .
"[23:15] fe016 | Mmm , huh . Um ."
[23:16] mn038 | This would never go away !
"[23:20] fe016 | It 's No , it 's OK ."
[23:21] me025 | OK .
"[23:24] fe016 | Sorry , listeners ."
[23:31] fe016 | Too bad you weren't here .
"[23:31] mn038 | You know , maybe thousands of people are listening to us now because it 's in the future , but , you know , sequentially maybe thousands ."
[23:35] me025 | Yeah .
[23:35] me055 | That 's right . It could be .
[23:37] me055 | This could be the most popular corpus . Yeah .
[23:40] fe016 | Normally a note taker would know not to do that . OK .
[23:43] me055 | Ha !
[23:43] me025 | Yeah .
[23:46] me055 | But that 's only on one sp
"[23:47] fe016 | Anyway , UW is getting some funding from DARPA on Communicator ,"
[23:51] fe008 | Uh .
"[23:52] fe016 | uh , with and that 's sorta how I got involved . I mean , Morgan wanted me to sort of"
"[23:57] fe016 | do something . I guess , I My interest was sort of in the language and dialogue m modeling , and the turn overlaps , and"
[24:03] fe016 | how to apply
"[24:05] fe016 | you know , a language model , a dialogue act model to actually feed down to do better recognition . So not just Because I think it will be really difficult"
[24:13] fe016 | to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it . I think you have to have some kind of structure
[24:17] me055 | Hmm .
[24:19] fe016 | from the I mean Yeah .
"[24:22] fe016 | So knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume , you should be able to figure out it 's a backchannel and things like that ."
"[24:28] fe016 | Anyway , apparently , and you guys know more than I do ,"
[24:33] fe016 | there was some talk that you were gonna build a portable version of this
[24:38] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:38] fe016 | I I mean , there 's not a huge amount of funding in the way ,"
"[24:41] fe016 | you know , Mari"
[24:42] fe016 | probably won't be able to do a ton of
[24:44] fe016 | collection . But
[24:45] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[24:46] fe016 | I was thinking if there were sort of prototype
[24:49] me055 | Hmm .
[24:50] me025 | Yeah .
"[24:50] fe016 | collection devices or standards , then we could"
[24:53] fe016 | share data . And we would have like a
[24:54] me025 | Yeah .
[25:00] me025 | Yeah .
"[25:00] fe016 | collecting data and each site can demo it , and say it 's at the other two sites ."
[25:05] me025 | Yeah .
[25:05] me055 | Hmm .
[25:05] fe016 | Which was would be really good for funding purposes .
[25:08] me011 | Right .
"[25:08] fe016 | But that I don't really know . That 's what I heard from Morgan , so ."
[25:13] me025 | That 's that that that portable thing 's been mentioned .
[25:18] me011 | Well i w when I spoke with him he he really just said it was a money issue .
[25:22] me011 | That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue where we 're perfectly willing to give people
[25:22] fe016 | OK .
[25:27] me011 | those boxes . The boxes are cheap .
[25:29] fe016 | Right .
"[25:29] me011 | Um , but , you know , can they afford to get"
"[25:31] me011 | a six channel Sony wireless and can they afford the P Z Ms , and that sort of stuff ."
"[25:35] fe016 | And he said something about a portable You know , that they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like like you guys have here ."
[25:40] me025 | I think I think
"[25:41] me025 | somebody 's got a unit which is something like the ADAT or something , which ,"
"[25:46] me025 | you know , it 's a device which will record onto tape , uh , multiple channels ."
[25:48] me011 | Oh .
[25:49] me025 | And so I think that was that was gonna be and we were g
[25:52] me025 | Like someone actually has this knocking around .
"[25:54] me025 | Some company that we were gonna uh , was gonna lend it to us , something like this ."
[25:54] fe016 | OK .
[26:00] me055 | Right .
"[26:02] me011 | may be giving us , uh - huh ."
[26:05] me025 | a big multi - channel thing .
"[26:07] me025 | Um , and so if we if they could lend us that , we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings . I mean that you know , that like you said , the fundamental thing is"
"[26:14] me025 | it doesn't have to be this hardware . It 's just the idea that you have multiple channels to synchronize data and then the post - processing can be uniform and stuff like that , so ."
[26:17] fe016 | Right .
[26:17] me055 | Mmm .
"[26:21] fe016 | Right , and it doesn't have You know , different sides can do different pieces of it I think ."
[26:26] me025 | Right .
[26:26] me011 | Yeah .
[26:31] fe016 | Exactly . Right .
[26:32] me055 | Yeah .
"[26:33] fe016 | And you 'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions , and"
[26:35] me011 | Yes .
[26:37] fe016 | I think just having three different sites
[26:39] me011 | That 'd be great .
[26:39] fe016 | would be great
"[26:40] me011 | Yeah , I agree ."
"[26:40] fe016 | just for sort of diversity , and so ."
[26:41] mn038 | Yeah .
[26:41] me055 | Mmm .
"[26:48] me056 | I mean , y you were talking about"
"[26:50] me056 | uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards . But the the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection , um ,"
[27:06] me025 | Right .
"[27:09] me056 | Um ,"
[27:10] me056 | and
[27:14] me056 | u
"[27:15] me056 | that 's certainly what 's gonna come out of , uh , of our group first ."
"[27:18] me011 | So so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ?"
[27:19] me056 | Uh um .
"[27:25] me056 | Well , so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do but"
[27:31] me011 | Uh - huh .
[27:32] me056 | it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first . So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should
"[27:36] me011 | Oh , I see ."
"[27:37] me056 | um , you know , subsequent things . Try to try to constrain them or not constrain them . Or try try to figure that out ."
[27:37] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:41] me011 | I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark"
"[27:45] me011 | "" I 'm talking to the computer "" ."
"[27:47] fe016 | Yeah , but you know what ? They don't say when they stop ."
[27:50] me011 | Right .
[27:51] me056 | Pardon ?
"[27:52] fe016 | They don't say ,"
"[27:53] fe016 | you know , "" I 'm done , Computer "" . They only mark the beginnings ."
[27:55] me025 | Yeah .
[27:55] me055 | Hmm .
[27:56] me056 | Yeah .
"[27:56] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[27:56] me055 | Well , there might be a different style of , um a different , actually , style of interaction . Yeah ."
[27:57] me056 | e
[27:59] me056 | i i is a g
[28:01] me056 | It is exactly these things that I mentioned . This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in . Exactly these . When when do you know when you 're starting and when you know you 're ending .
"[28:06] me025 | No , but No but , y"
"[28:07] me025 | But it 's like , you know , if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say ,"
"[28:10] me025 | "" Oh , perhaps the computer could show us this . "" And you 'd be talking to someone else but the computer 's meant to be listening , and so saying ,"
"[28:15] me025 | "" Oh , it means me . "" You know , "" I shou"
"[28:17] me025 | I should I should do something now . """
"[28:18] me055 | Yes , certainly ."
[28:25] me055 | Mmm .
[28:27] fe016 | So .
[28:28] me056 | Yeah . So . Right . So we wanna we wanna look at exactly those sorts of things .
[28:28] me055 | Mmm !
"[28:29] fe016 | I I think , yeah ."
"[28:45] me056 | of of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics . It 's not going to be natural . It 's not gonna be a regular meeting . It 's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we 're gonna have to , you know , mock up some back - end ."
[28:55] me056 | Um .
"[29:04] fe016 | But you can still collect the multiple microphones in a similar way and transcribe , and th"
[29:07] me055 | Mmm .
[29:08] me056 | we 'll have all this all the m microphones set up all the same .
[29:09] fe016 | That 'd be cool actually .
[29:10] me025 | Yeah .
"[29:11] me025 | I mean , that 's the question . If if we are collecting these at different sites , different kinds of tasks , different people ,"
[29:16] me025 | what is there that 's gonna be uniform about this collection ?
[29:18] me056 | Mm - hmm .
[29:19] me056 | Right .
"[29:19] me025 | And part of it will be , well , this combination of close talking and uh ,"
[29:23] me055 | Mmm .
"[29:23] me025 | and uh , environmental mikes ."
"[29:25] me025 | And and then part of it will just be the data presentation , you know , maybe if if we have common transcription standards and , you know , that it 's all transcribed or"
[29:31] me025 | there 's there 's some integration of the standards thing .
[29:33] me056 | Right .
[29:34] me025 | But I mean I u u
"[29:38] fe016 | Yeah , I mean , I think the formats would be similar ."
[29:44] me025 | Right .
"[29:44] me056 | and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which ,"
"[29:49] me056 | uh , that there 's much a difference ."
[29:49] me025 | Yeah .
[29:49] fe008 | Hmm .
[29:55] fe016 | a log file format that can handle
[29:58] me025 | Right . Right .
[30:00] fe016 | So
"[30:06] fe016 | issues . You know , not not the f transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the"
[30:10] me011 | Uh - huh .
[30:10] fe016 | sort of
"[30:11] fe016 | figuring out how to synchronize all of these ,"
"[30:14] fe016 | um , pieces ."
[30:17] fe016 | And what kind of software you can use for post - processing all of them .
[30:20] me025 | Yeah .
[30:20] me011 | Right . Someone will make some assumption that 's different than
[30:22] me055 | Yeah .
[30:22] me011 | someone else . And then we suddenly won't be able to interoperate .
"[30:23] fe016 | Yeah , which i"
"[30:23] me055 | Well , just just the fact that people are making different assumptions is quite an interesting problem ."
[30:26] me011 | Yep .
[30:26] me056 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:28] me055 | You know , it 's quite an interesting issue ."
[30:31] me055 | That brings up Mmm .
[30:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[30:32] me011 | I I 'm not sure what wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other .
[30:33] me025 | But yeah .
[30:43] me011 | Right .
"[30:43] mn038 | We could have like , you know , some periodic meetings , and like , uh ,"
[30:43] me055 | Mmm .
[30:45] me011 | Yeah .
[30:48] mn038 | phone meetings or something .
[30:48] me011 | Uh - huh .
"[30:49] me011 | Yeah , I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them ."
[30:52] mn038 | Yeah . At the same time we contribute to the database
[30:53] fe016 | with a telephone .
"[30:54] me011 | Yep ,"
"[30:54] me055 | Yeah , contribute the data ."
[30:55] me011 | absolutely .
"[30:55] fe016 | No , I 'm serious ."
"[30:56] mn038 | collection ,"
"[30:57] mn038 | and , uh ."
[31:07] fe016 | Right .
[31:09] me011 | Right .
[31:11] me056 | m your normal kind of meeting .
"[31:12] me011 | When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though . So they 're gonna s say , you 're you 're having a meeting to do this ."
[31:12] fe016 | Right .
[31:16] me056 | They 're going to be goal directed .
"[31:19] me056 | You 're supposed to Yeah , you know . You 're supposed to you 're a budget meeting or something and you have a spreadsheet up there , and everybody has to sort of work out the you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money . And they can t ask the computer to"
[31:30] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[31:32] me056 | switch things around in different columns or something like that . But everybody s
[31:36] me056 | and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people .
[31:40] me011 | Oh . So that will be different .
[31:40] me056 | Um .
[31:42] me056 | Yeah . So .
[31:42] me055 | Hmm .
[31:43] mn038 | How is that ? Three peop total ?
"[31:45] me056 | We 're gonna start with just three people , yeah ."
[31:46] me055 | Is that the channel limitation cutting in ?
"[31:48] me056 | Um , I think it 's mainly It 's partly channel limitation because we wanna we wanna double mike everybody ."
[31:54] me055 | Mmm .
"[31:54] me025 | Oh , right ."
[31:54] me011 | Oh .
[31:57] me056 | And we have eight channels . Um .
"[32:00] me056 | It 's also I think , uh , e e sort of what came up I think when even Liz was , uh , involved a little while ago with and Christine I think just in terms of the"
[32:19] fe016 | Yeah .
"[32:20] me011 | You 're double miking everyone , so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes , is that right ?"
[32:22] me056 | A g
[32:24] me055 | Two of @ @ . Yeah .
"[32:24] me056 | Yes , that was that was the idea . Uh , but"
[32:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[32:27] me055 | M
"[32:27] me056 | I don't know , that was , you know , w"
[32:27] fe016 | Hmm .
"[32:28] me056 | we 're not uh planning to do anything with with all that like right away . So if there were is there you know , we h we 're happy to take input on that ."
[32:32] me011 | Right .
[32:34] me025 | Wha -
"[32:34] fe008 | Is it the three , I see , mm - hmm ."
"[32:35] me056 | And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card cuz I think we might wanna go with that ."
[32:41] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[32:42] me055 | Mmm .
[32:42] fe008 | I wanna ask one question though . So is is it the same three people each time or a different three people ?
"[32:46] me056 | No , no , we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece ."
"[32:48] fe008 | OK , OK . That 's good ."
"[32:49] me055 | And do you have the same agenda , although there 's a goal ? Is there one goal or several goals ?"
[32:54] me056 | Uh .
"[32:58] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[32:58] me056 | What we 're try what we 're trying to do is not make it too eh you know , not make it too , um , ar artificial . You know , not like say , "" OK , mmm , let 's role play . Your , y "" you know , "" you do this , you wanna "" but rather give them an actual task ."
[33:07] me055 | Right .
"[33:08] mn057 | Well , there can be like a problem solution kind of thing where they would actually , you know they have to come to one solution ."
"[33:14] me056 | Yeah , and they all just have their own they just happen to have their own opinions . And another possible thing that we 're thinking of is something like , uh , you know , we have these regular Wednesday lunches and you gotta plan a menu , right ?"
[33:14] me055 | Right .
[33:17] me055 | Right .
[33:17] mn038 | S
"[33:24] mn038 | Well , some peo people speak with their mouth full , you know that 's a @ @ ."
[33:29] me056 | But a lot of the No . None of that .
[33:29] me025 | Right .
"[33:30] me011 | That is , uh ."
"[33:35] me025 | Right , right , right ."
"[33:35] me011 | Yes ,"
[33:36] me011 | or drinking .
"[33:43] mn038 | So so , I One question ."
[33:43] me025 | Yeah .
"[33:45] mn038 | I I mean , I haven't been in these ,"
"[33:47] mn038 | you know , preliminary de decision meetings ,"
[33:50] mn038 | but I don't know what 's
"[33:53] mn038 | idea for the computer interaction . I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ?"
"[34:07] me056 | So basically , what wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around . So"
[34:15] mn038 | And so it will be a real computer recognition .
"[34:20] mn038 | Oh , OK ."
"[34:20] me011 | So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it ."
"[34:23] me056 | Uh yes , but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent . And so it just be you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with . We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with . But these are all components"
[34:23] me055 | Mmm .
[34:26] mn038 | OK .
[34:32] mn038 | Yeah .
"[34:33] mn038 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[34:33] me056 | that are obvious to us how to build . Nothing nothing that 's sort of far in the future . It 's just a matter of of work .
[34:35] me055 | Mmm .
[34:35] mn038 | Yeah .
[34:37] mn038 | So somebody will be playing the recognizer and then other agents will be doing their task independently .
[34:42] mn038 | OK .
"[34:43] me056 | So ,"
"[34:44] me056 | sort of Right . Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly and makes sense how to do . So a fairly simple back - end ."
[34:51] mn038 | Yeah .
[34:51] me056 | Um .
[34:56] mn038 | Good .
"[34:57] me011 | Yeah , I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training"
"[35:01] me025 | Oh , yeah . Yeah , sure ."
"[35:02] me011 | uh , the acoustic models , without any question ."
[35:02] me056 | Uh - huh .
"[35:02] fe016 | Yeah , definitely ."
[35:04] mn038 | You p
[35:04] me055 | Mmm .
[35:04] mn038 | you plan to to train actually models
[35:05] me056 | That 's good .
[35:06] mn038 | based on this data .
"[35:06] me011 | Oh , absolutely ."
[35:06] me056 | Yeah .
[35:07] me056 | Great .
"[35:08] me011 | Yeah , cuz if you don't the the accuracy 's gonna be horrendously bad ."
[35:09] me055 | Mmm .
[35:10] me055 | Right .
"[35:10] mn038 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[35:10] me055 | And this is just train um , training them using the um , the head - mounted data initially ."
[35:11] me011 | So .
"[35:16] me055 | Or , I mean is the intention to do some som Right ."
"[35:17] me011 | Well , we 'll definitely need to do both ."
"[35:18] me025 | No ,"
"[35:19] me025 | I think the idea is to train on the , uh on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we 're gonna train to , right ?"
[35:23] me055 | OK . Understood . Right .
[35:23] me011 | Right .
[35:24] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:32] me055 | or , uh , uh , the sort of acoustic modeling of the environment or microphones , or anything else ?"
[35:35] me025 | I don't know .
[35:36] me011 | It it really i
"[35:36] me055 | Cuz that 's actually my interest at the moment , so ."
[35:38] me011 | It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that . So .
[35:39] me055 | Hmm .
"[35:41] me055 | Right , right ."
[35:41] me025 | Yeah .
[35:42] mn038 | Yeah .
"[35:42] me025 | Well , also , I mean , I I I suspect that it may we may not"
[35:42] me011 | I
"[35:45] me025 | be able to get anywhere without doing something ,"
"[35:47] me055 | Yeah , yeah ."
[35:48] me025 | right ? So .
[35:49] mn038 | Yeah .
[35:49] me025 | We may end up having to do that .
"[35:50] me011 | just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions where ,"
"[35:54] me011 | uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before ,"
[35:57] me011 | uh .
[35:59] me011 | Having people read digit strings cuz digits are much easier .
[35:59] fe016 | That was Morgan .
[36:02] me055 | Mmm .
[36:02] me011 | Um .
"[36:02] me056 | Oh , that 's really interesting ."
[36:05] me011 | just doing multis
[36:07] me055 | Hmm .
"[36:07] me011 | Yeah , of course ."
[36:11] me011 | Yeah .
[36:11] me025 | Uh - huh .
"[36:12] me011 | But , uh , just mixing"
[36:16] me011 | just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously .
[36:20] me011 | And I was a little surprised .
"[36:22] fe008 | Hmm , hmm ."
[36:22] me055 | Right .
[36:23] fe016 | Why why is that ?
[36:24] me011 | Wh - why ? I have no idea . Because they 're a little different .
[36:25] fe016 | Why ?
"[36:27] me055 | Sorry . When you say multi multi - stream , you mean - r"
[36:29] fe016 | The microphones are different ?
[36:33] me025 | the posteriors on full band recognition
[36:34] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[36:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[36:36] me025 | like from from three different or four different mikes .
[36:37] me011 | Right .
[36:38] me055 | Right .
[36:38] me025 | Cool .
[36:39] me055 | Hmm .
[36:40] fe016 | Hmm .
[36:40] me011 | And that actually helped . That gave several percent improvement .
[36:41] me055 | That 's interesting .
"[36:42] me055 | Right , yeah ."
"[36:45] me011 | Absolute . So that , uh ,"
[36:46] me011 | I think just just having stereo will help cuz they 're a little different .
[36:49] mn038 | Yeah .
"[36:50] me011 | You get a little slightly different estimators and , uh ,"
[36:50] me055 | Hmm .
[36:50] mn038 | Yeah .
"[36:53] me011 | uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better ."
[36:55] mn038 | So basically if you
"[36:59] mn038 | collecting a database uh for database for training , I mean , you are talking about ,"
"[37:03] mn038 | you know , twenty thousand or forty thousand sentences ."
[37:07] mn038 | Things like that .
"[37:08] me025 | It 's something like tens of hours tens of hours of data , I think . Yeah ."
[37:10] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[37:10] me011 | M
[37:11] mn038 | Tens of hours .
[37:12] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[37:12] me011 | So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours .
[37:12] me056 | Yeah .
[37:15] mn038 | OK .
[37:15] me011 | And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money .
[37:21] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[37:22] me011 | If they can actually do it .
[37:23] me025 | Really ?
[37:23] me055 | Mmm .
[37:25] fe016 | Mmm .
"[37:25] me011 | I mean , that 's what they had said before but I guess that was more ambitious ."
[37:29] fe016 | They were gonna There was a difference in the amount of money awarded from the beginning to e
[37:30] me055 | Mmm .
[37:32] me011 | Uh - huh .
[37:33] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[37:34] fe016 | Um .
"[37:35] mn038 | But I mean , i i"
"[37:37] me011 | Yeah , recording it 's easy ."
"[37:39] fe016 | Yeah , recording is Right ."
[37:40] me011 | It 's transcription that 's a pain .
"[37:41] me055 | It 's transcription and processing , yeah ."
[37:41] fe016 | Right .
[37:42] fe008 | Yeah .
[37:44] me055 | Hmm ?
[37:48] me011 | Oh .
[37:50] fe008 | I 'd give you my mike .
[37:52] fe016 | You can have my mike .
"[37:53] me025 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[37:55] fe008 | Oh , I 'm not allowed to . OK ."
[37:57] fe008 | Alrighty .
"[37:59] me025 | we need to , uh ."
"[37:59] mn038 | So , I mean , clearly i if everybody 's collecting data"
[38:01] me056 | Uh .
"[38:04] me056 | One thing I should point out , we were n we were not planning on tra doing transcription of the full thing right away , u cuz that 's not I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer ."
[38:08] mn038 | Mm - hmm .
[38:13] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[38:14] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[38:14] me055 | Mmm .
"[38:14] me056 | And so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing . But I mean , that 's something to talk about ."
[38:14] me025 | Right .
[38:16] me025 | OK .
"[38:21] me056 | If you wanted if you wanted to transcribe , you have the @ @ yes , @ @ you 'll be fine ."
[38:21] me011 | a a company .
[38:24] mn038 | Yeah .
[38:25] fe016 | No .
[38:28] me025 | Cuz we 're very naturalistic here .
[38:28] fe016 | Yeah .
"[38:30] fe016 | But it , um , and there will be a lot of"
"[38:33] fe016 | people to people talk in those meetings I bet with even three people , so ."
[38:37] me011 | IBM .
[38:38] fe016 | Yeah .
"[38:39] me055 | I guessed it from the clue , yeah ."
[38:40] mn038 | Ah !
[38:40] me011 | we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects and they don't it 's hard for them to give us money
[38:47] me011 | but they they seem to be willing to give us time .
[38:50] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[38:50] me011 | And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus .
[38:54] mn038 | Yeah .
"[38:56] mn038 | So basically it seems to be like , uh ,"
"[38:58] mn038 | I mean , if everybody"
[38:59] mn038 | w e u
"[39:00] mn038 | was in the universities collecting data , we are , you are , I mean ,"
"[39:04] mn038 | sharing the data and making a bigger corpus is going to be ,"
[39:06] me011 | It would be great .
"[39:06] me055 | Mmm , mmm ."
"[39:07] fe016 | Oh , yeah ."
"[39:07] mn038 | you know , a benefit for everybody ."
[39:07] me011 | Yeah .
"[39:08] me011 | Yes , absolutely . I think that would be excellent ."
[39:09] me025 | Yeah .
"[39:09] fe016 | And , uh , it will really help the design too . It 'll m keep it from being too specific to somebody 's set up or task ."
[39:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[39:13] mn038 | Yeah .
"[39:24] me025 | Um , bu but how much how valuable Given that you 're interested in this computer - directed data and we 're not gonna have any of that ?"
"[39:29] me056 | Well , that 's me personally . Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues ."
[39:30] me025 | Yeah .
[39:32] me025 | I see .
[39:33] me025 | Yeah .
[39:34] me055 | Mmm .
"[39:34] me056 | Um ,"
[39:34] fe016 | Yeah .
"[39:35] me056 | and I 'm also interested in prosody , um ,"
"[39:38] me056 | use you know , u used over person to person stuff like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff ."
[39:43] me025 | Right .
[39:43] me011 | So al
[39:46] me011 | Right .
[39:46] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[39:49] fe016 | So actually having different
[39:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[40:00] me055 | Mmm . Mmm .
[40:00] fe016 | their prosodic patterns . That 's not what we want .
[40:00] me025 | Right .
[40:03] me056 | Mm - hmm .
[40:03] me011 | So so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ?
[40:08] fe016 | That is from the transcription and from the speaker s segmentation .
[40:13] fe016 | That 's not hard .
[40:14] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[40:14] fe016 | I think the hard part is getting enough training data and
[40:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[40:17] fe016 | nor you also need normalization data . So you 're sort of
[40:23] fe016 | So .
[40:31] me011 | The language models probably won't be .
[40:33] me056 | N the language models c Yeah .
[40:34] fe016 | Actually the acoustic may not be either .
"[40:39] me056 | Really ? Oh , sure ."
"[40:39] me011 | Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be ."
[40:44] me011 | Yeah .
[40:45] mn038 | Yeah .
[40:46] me056 | Yeah .
"[40:47] me025 | Hmm , right ."
[40:48] me055 | Mmm .
"[40:49] me056 | uh we 're we 're gonna be using the same thing that we 've done in the past which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway . It 's written in unification"
[40:58] me056 | grammar framework .
[40:59] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:59] me056 | um , but with context free grammar , power , and so it 's"
"[41:03] me056 | just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with with no , um ,"
[41:08] me011 | And you 're gonna hand c hand - code that ?
[41:09] me056 | It 's it 's it 's hand - coded . Because we need we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand .
"[41:15] me056 | So it 's it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task ."
"[41:16] me011 | Oh , I I uh sure , sure , sure , sure . I see ."
[41:17] me055 | Hmm .
"[41:18] me056 | So , yeah , that 's that 's the way we 've been approaching it ."
"[41:22] me056 | Eh if we if we 're ge yeah , we you know , if we 're gonna be able to"
[41:22] me011 | do that anyway .
"[41:25] me056 | interpret it then I mean , if we 're not gonna be able to interpret that then it 's not gonna do us much good anyway to recognize it ."
[41:30] me056 | So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar .
[41:33] fe008 | Is it is it gonna be like an HPSG kind of grammar ?
"[41:36] me056 | It is a unification base , it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular , although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds ."
[41:43] fe008 | I see .
"[41:56] me011 | doing meetings , actually starting to record some ?"
[41:58] mn038 | I guess
"[42:00] mn038 | Yeah . I mean ,"
"[42:04] mn038 | well , indeed . I mean , most people , you know , after this evaluation and conference @ @ should be working"
[42:05] me055 | Mmm .
[42:10] me056 | Uh - huh .
[42:10] mn038 | on these type of things .
"[42:12] mn038 | At least , you know"
[42:12] fe016 | Yeah .
[42:12] me056 | Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project .
[42:15] me055 | Yeah .
"[42:16] mn038 | but eventually I mean ,"
"[42:19] mn038 | will be people working on uh kind of recognition aspects and , uh , you know ,"
[42:24] mn038 | and and and in core technology .
"[42:26] mn038 | So I mean , recognition technology and also core ,"
"[42:29] mn038 | you know , algorithms ,"
"[42:30] mn038 | et cetera . And for those people to have these data will be ,"
"[42:34] mn038 | you know , the best way to ,"
[42:35] me056 | Right .
"[42:36] mn038 | you know , develop the systems to an @ @ ."
[42:37] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:38] me011 | Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions ."
[42:42] mn038 | Yeah .
[42:44] mn038 | Yeah .
"[42:44] fe016 | Yeah , definitely ."
[42:44] me056 | Yes .
[42:45] me056 | Yes .
[42:46] me011 | Um .
"[42:46] me056 | Well , so we haven't even you know , we haven't collected a byte yet so ."
"[42:48] fe016 | Right . That 's actually why I called this meeting , cuz i I mean , you 're both working on it and with , you know , different sampling rates , and these silly things like that ."
"[42:50] me011 | Well , yeah , it 's a it 's ex excellent , excellent ."
"[42:50] me055 | Mmm , mmm ."
[42:50] me056 | Right .
[42:52] me056 | Yeah .
"[42:53] me011 | Yeah , that 's right . I mean , just just just"
[42:54] me055 | Mmm .
[42:54] mn038 | Yeah .
"[42:56] me011 | agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that ."
[42:56] me056 | And we have the same sampling rate . One one thing we do know is that we 're we 're all producing NIST
[42:58] me055 | Sampling rate in the end . Yeah .
[42:58] fe016 | What ?
"[43:00] fe016 | Oh ,"
[43:01] fe016 | OK .
"[43:03] me056 | Sphere files in in , uh , eh in the standard format . Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz . So at the end we 're all And the amazing thing is that even even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff ."
"[43:05] me011 | Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ? Eh , good good ."
"[43:06] me055 | Bits , sixteen - K , yeah ."
"[43:07] fe016 | OK , s"
[43:14] me025 | Yeah .
[43:15] fe016 | OK .
"[43:16] fe016 | Well I just made that up but ,"
"[43:17] me056 | And so tha yeah . So , @ @ Yeah , it 's coincidence that it 's very fortunate cuz Yeah ."
[43:26] me025 | Yeah .
"[43:26] me056 | We actually have , yeah , quite similar hardware as it turns out ."
[43:27] me055 | It 's similar but not quite the same .
"[43:28] fe016 | OK , so so ."
[43:29] me055 | Yeah .
[43:31] me011 | So I I think probably the biggest thing
"[43:34] me011 | would Well , no that that wouldn't be true . If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself ,"
[43:38] me011 | then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions .
[43:42] fe016 | Actually that 's the transcription conventions I was talking about this with Jane it 's really important to people at least like me
"[43:48] fe016 | who wanna know , um , certain"
[43:50] me011 | Right of it .
[43:54] fe016 | they 're not words but they 're structural things you 're trying to recognize .
[43:56] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[43:58] fe016 | And also I guess for the speaker .
[44:01] fe016 | People interested in the speaker
[44:02] fe016 | separation because what you call a turn
"[44:05] fe016 | and the end of a turn , and that it it 's"
[44:07] me055 | Mmm .
[44:10] fe016 | It 's inherently hard . And so you have to make some
"[44:13] fe016 | simplifications and different people make different simplifications , and then you can't compare them at all , which is what the literature is sort of like now ."
[44:15] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:21] fe016 | So , um , and then there 's the issue of recognizer dictionaries , and non - standard forms , and things like that that have to be mapped ."
[44:28] me056 | Yeah .
"[44:28] fe016 | So "" gonna "" versus "" going to "" and that kind of thing ."
[44:30] me011 | Right .
"[44:30] me056 | I mean , all those issues yeah I 'm sure we I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm I 'm personally not"
[44:30] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[44:30] me055 | Mmm .
[44:34] me056 | interested in those for my particular aspect of the project but SRI in general is is the Yeah .
[44:38] fe016 | but we definitely will be interested in some language and dialogue .
"[44:41] me056 | And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be maybe we 'll end up doing that ."
[44:41] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[44:43] fe016 | So .
"[44:45] fe016 | And UW is also probably gonna be interested in that too , the dialogue kinds of things ."
"[44:50] fe016 | So , i"
[44:54] fe008 | Is is Morgan nodding his head ?
[44:56] me025 | Yeah .
[44:56] me011 | So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about
[44:59] fe016 | Yeah .
"[44:59] me011 | transcription conventions , that would be very helpful ."
[45:01] mn038 | Yeah .
"[45:01] fe016 | Yeah , that 's originally We should thank Jane because that 's how I originally she showed me some transcripts and I thought , "" Wow ,"
[45:02] me055 | Right .
[45:03] me011 | Yeah .
[45:07] me055 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:07] fe016 | this is great "" ."
[45:09] me011 | Yep .
"[45:09] fe016 | Oh , yeah ."
"[45:09] me055 | Yeah , yeah , to study using the same thing ."
[45:11] mn038 | You were also thinking about the same tool ?
[45:11] me025 | That 's interesting .
[45:11] fe016 | Yeah .
"[45:13] me056 | We we we were gonna use the same tool . We we set up that tool already , yeah ."
[45:13] mn038 | Wow !
[45:14] fe016 | But what if you had like
[45:16] mn038 | Already !
[45:18] me011 | Hmm . That 's right .
"[45:20] me025 | Well , the I mean , and in some ways that does change the , uh , the economics of doing that ."
[45:21] me055 | Can you do that ?
"[45:25] me011 | Right . It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it . Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription ,"
"[45:25] me025 | But , um ."
[45:25] me055 | Hmm ! Yeah .
[45:27] me055 | Yeah .
[45:28] fe016 | Yeah .
[45:28] me025 | Yeah .
"[45:28] me056 | Yeah , that 's right ."
"[45:32] me025 | Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . But we still yeah ."
[45:33] me011 | I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using .
[45:35] me056 | Uh - huh .
[45:36] fe016 | But you still need something that can display these channels .
[45:36] me025 | That 's interesting .
"[45:38] me025 | Right , we need we need some kind of browsing ."
[45:39] fe016 | e e better than what
[45:40] me025 | Yeah .
"[45:41] fe016 | it can do , I mean ."
[45:42] fe016 | And then I guess who is the contact at UW ? Like
[45:48] me011 | That 's alright . He can talk anyway .
"[45:48] me025 | He 's allowed to speak , he ca yeah ."
"[45:50] fe008 | Well , he could be reached he could be reached by the far field , couldn't he ?"
"[45:52] me013 | Yeah . No , I it 's just that there 's no @ @ ."
[45:55] fe008 | Yeah .
"[45:56] me013 | Oh , at U W . I 'm sorry ."
"[45:57] fe016 | Yeah . I mean , both I think both Jeff and Katrin have some time on this ."
[46:00] me013 | On on the transcription issues ?
"[46:02] fe016 | No , on the p on the DARPA project , who would be sort of contacts"
[46:09] fe016 | Mari .
"[46:11] me013 | Yeah , then she 'll tell us who to"
[46:11] me055 | Mmm .
"[46:12] fe016 | OK , yeah ."
[46:13] me055 | Mmm .
[46:13] me013 | talk to .
[46:14] me013 | But I think Mari .
"[46:16] me013 | And the IB the IBM ,"
"[46:19] me013 | The , uh , the IBM thing , uh i they basically have said "" yes "" ."
[46:25] me013 | because you were probably talking around it because you were concerned it was secret .
"[46:28] me013 | But it 's not not really secret . Basically ,"
"[46:30] me013 | there 's a proposal in to Mari to uh , tsk IBM from Mari and us"
"[46:36] me013 | uh , for some funding . It 's actually a pretty small amount even if it gets funded ."
"[46:40] me013 | Uh , but the most appealing thing in it to us was , in a way , that they 're gonna do this transcription and also potentially give us some equipment ."
[46:48] me013 | Uh or loan us some equipment we could use .
"[46:50] me013 | And it it occurred to me one day that that ,"
"[46:53] me013 | uh , we didn't have to wait for their proposal process to go through because , since they 're interested in supplying this to us , we could just ask them for that since it didn't quote - unquote cost them anything ."
"[47:03] me013 | Uh , and , uh , they said uh Mike Picheny said "" sure "" ."
"[47:09] me013 | So , eh , as far as I know we are"
[47:12] me013 | on to have them do it . It 's just a question of people on our end and people on their end talking about what are the mechanics of it and then it will it will just happen .
"[47:28] me013 | excuse me for covering things that we might have already talked about , but as a as long as everybody is fine ,"
"[47:34] me013 | with the data being basically free to the people involved ,"
"[47:39] me013 | um , at least , we can talk about being far more open than that , which we probably should be , but"
"[47:44] me013 | at at the very least , all the people involved , uh ,"
"[47:47] me013 | at any level can have access to all of it so you guys can have it , UW can have it , we can have it , and IBM can have it , and"
[47:49] mn038 | Uh - huh .
[47:53] me013 | lots to discuss further .
"[47:54] me056 | I don't think we have any problem . I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC ."
"[47:56] mn038 | No , yeah ."
[48:00] mn038 | this this is something that re
[48:01] me011 | LDC is what we were thinking too .
"[48:01] mn038 | re requires a bootstrap . I mean , there is no LDC database . There is , at least we have to share the data , I mean ."
"[48:02] me056 | Yeah , so we have no problem with that ."
[48:02] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[48:02] fe016 | Yeah .
[48:03] fe016 | Yeah .
[48:04] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[48:07] me055 | Mmm .
"[48:08] mn038 | That 's the bottom line , uh ."
"[48:08] fe016 | I I mean , I think eventually LDC could be very interested in it , especially if you have a tool that can do this . I mean , there isn't one ."
[48:11] mn038 | Yeah .
[48:13] me013 | Right .
[48:13] mn038 | Yeah .
[48:14] me011 | Hmm .
[48:17] mn038 | Yeah .
"[48:19] fe016 | You can sell corpora eventually to the LDC and you can get time , student time , to clean up the corpus and things ."
[48:21] me013 | Yeah .
[48:24] me013 | Right .
"[48:25] me013 | So that s that requires more thinking and discussion but but certainly amongst everybody who is helping one another , w w why not ? And I yeah ."
[48:25] me025 | Hmm .
[48:26] fe016 | So .
[48:27] fe016 | Yeah .
[48:34] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[48:34] mn038 | Yep .
[48:35] me013 | So we should talk with
"[48:36] me013 | Mike Picheny about , you know , after this m yeah , get some other briefing later about other things that were said , but uh , assuming that it is what I think it feels like , having walked in ten minutes ago ,"
"[48:48] me013 | uh , it seems li I c I can't imagine that he 'd have any problem with getting even more data than than he thought he was ."
[48:56] me025 | Right .
"[48:56] fe008 | I wanted to ask one question about the the nature of the design . Th - Given that the overlaps are up up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas ,"
[48:57] me056 | It 's terrific .
"[49:06] fe008 | um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule where if a person , you know , the that there 's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that to cut down on the so you then you have the meeting context , you have multiple channels , you have the microphones n varying the way you want them to vary ,"
"[49:22] fe008 | but you 'd cut down substantially on the overlaps . It wouldn't be f for all meetings but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while , something like that might be useful or not . Just wanted to raise that ."
[49:31] fe008 | I don't know .
"[49:32] me025 | I mean , it 's difficult because you want it to be"
"[49:34] me025 | real speech , right ? And also it 's not clear how well people can even adjust to even"
[49:35] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[49:37] me056 | Yeah .
[49:37] me025 | adjust to that kind of rule .
"[49:39] me056 | I mean , s it tho those those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of of trying , cuz we are having we do have a more artificial set environment again ."
[49:40] me011 | Robert 's rules .
[49:41] me025 | Yeah .
[49:47] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[49:47] me056 | We 're trying something totally new having people speak to the computer .
"[49:51] me056 | I don't think we talked about that in particular cuz we didn't we haven't done any pilots , we haven't seen this ,"
[49:59] me056 | But this is
"[50:07] me056 | sh she 's interested in these sorts of things . What what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load ,"
"[50:15] me056 | um , that can help things out , or , you know , those sorts of issues . So ,"
[50:19] me056 | I don't know . Maybe it 's something that could fit easier in in our context than in a general meeting context . I don't know .
"[50:23] fe008 | Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if if if we were to have this kind of coordination thing ,"
[50:26] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[50:28] fe008 | some some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point
"[50:32] fe008 | without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time . And if and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator , then you raise your hand , the moderator would say , you first , you know , or yeah , press the button ."
"[50:43] fe008 | And and I think , you know , there are always gonna be backchannels , I think that 's natural and lovely . But these these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and and wanting to coordinate you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened . Not eliminated entirely ."
[50:46] me056 | Mm - mmm .
[50:46] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[50:54] me056 | I don't know .
"[50:56] me011 | There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens , y that"
[50:59] fe008 | Yeah .
[51:00] fe016 | Right .
"[51:02] me011 | Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before but I think it it it certainly is another"
[51:07] me011 | type of meeting that could be done .
[51:09] me025 | Yeah .
[51:09] me013 | Ha - have you been continuing the practice of collecting connected digits and so forth ?
[51:09] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:14] me011 | Uh , no , I didn't . I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting , so I didn't ."
"[51:16] me013 | No , I meant the independent in the other meetings ."
"[51:17] me025 | Yeah , in general yeah ."
"[51:18] me011 | Yes , in the other meetings we have ."
[51:19] me025 | Yeah .
[51:19] fe008 | And they 've been collecting digits too .
[51:21] me013 | Yeah .
[51:22] fe008 | OK .
"[51:22] me011 | So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way ."
[51:23] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[51:24] me055 | Mmm .
"[51:27] me056 | And and not within a not within a big room . Just , uh ."
[51:39] me056 | Yeah .
[51:40] me055 | Mmm .
[51:40] fe008 | That 's a good idea .
"[51:46] fe016 | But sorry , so you connect you collect digits"
"[51:50] me011 | No , no , I have people read them ."
[51:52] fe016 | Uh .
[51:57] me055 | Yeah .
"[52:01] me013 | No we have set sets of digit strings that we 've got from TI - digits I guess , and the idea was just that we would have have some data with different speakers with far - field microphone effects , so that we could look at far - field versus the close mike or @ @ ."
[52:11] me056 | Uh - huh .
[52:15] me055 | Mmm .
"[52:15] fe016 | So you don't need the meeting for that . You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones . Right , OK ."
"[52:18] me013 | No , but as long as we have this same space , it 's just amortizing the people the time that they 're there ."
[52:19] me056 | But you need the room and the set up .
"[52:21] fe016 | Right , right . OK ."
[52:22] me055 | Right .
"[52:22] me056 | Yeah , we 're doing digits yeah , we 're not doing digits in the in the room set up at all . We 're doing it for a complete I mean ,"
[52:23] me025 | Yeah .
"[52:27] me056 | one of the specific things I 'm interested in is knowing um , is the open mike issue . When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking ."
[52:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[52:34] me056 | And so I 'm loo interested in in well , in interested in looking at prosody . Um ,"
[52:38] me013 | Yeah .
"[52:38] me011 | Oh , cool ."
"[52:39] me056 | and so we 're just having we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know ,"
"[52:43] me056 | you know , "" there was a big gap in time here but , they "" you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done , so ."
[52:44] me013 | Yeah .
[52:45] me013 | Yeah .
"[52:47] me013 | Yeah , so that 's a different deal . Here it 's just we have the same group of people . You 're amortizing their time , but also ,"
[52:48] me056 | Yeah .
[52:58] fe016 | I I think that 's a really good idea . To always yeah .
[52:58] me055 | Hmm .
[53:00] me025 | but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on because you what we we have is like these lists of ten digit strings or twenty digit strings and they 're like one one to five or one to seven digits .
"[53:09] me025 | And people read through them . And you know , we 're saying , well we won't to be able to separate them so please pause between but it 's very people don't like doing that ."
"[53:23] me055 | Mmm , mmm ."
"[53:23] fe016 | Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah , d"
"[53:23] me056 | Yeah , right ."
"[53:24] me011 | Nice falling , yeah ."
"[53:24] me055 | Declination , yeah ."
[53:25] me056 | Right .
[53:28] me025 | Right .
"[53:28] me011 | Oh , I hadn't thought about that ."
[53:30] me055 | Mmm .
[53:32] me011 | I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple . Definitely should .
[53:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[53:33] fe016 | Yeah .
"[53:33] fe016 | No , but that that is beautiful because then you can get this F zero floor"
[53:34] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[53:38] fe016 | for each of the speakers . Just from that .
[53:39] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[53:40] me055 | Right , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[53:40] mn057 | Yeah .
[53:43] me011 | Don't throw it away but don't use it in your training .
"[53:44] fe016 | Your your junk is our , uh , training data ."
[53:46] me055 | Mmm .
[53:47] me025 | Yeah .
[53:47] me011 | Cool .
"[53:48] fe016 | No , that 's a really good idea to have some standard I mean , especially if a the different sites can do something like that ."
[53:54] me013 | Yeah .
"[53:55] fe016 | You 'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to ,"
"[53:59] me025 | Right , right . There 'll be a common That 'd be great . Yeah , that 's a good idea ."
[54:02] fe016 | Yeah .
"[54:10] me013 | then after I had a chance to sleep on it , I went , "" Wait a minute "" it 's it 's a really good idea ."
[54:14] fe008 | That 's a good idea .
[54:14] fe016 | Oh .
"[54:14] me055 | That 's the reason , uh - huh ."
"[54:14] fe016 | You should definitely it 's some kind of calibration , uh , for uh many of these tests ."
[54:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[54:17] me013 | Yeah .
[54:17] me025 | Yeah .
[54:17] me011 | Right .
[54:17] me055 | Mmm .
[54:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[54:19] me011 | The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich ,"
[54:24] me025 | Right .
"[54:24] fe016 | Well , you could have TI you know , "" she put her dirty laundry in the clean clean bathwater "" , whatever ."
[54:24] me011 | but .
"[54:27] me011 | Yeah , that 's right , TIMIT ."
[54:29] me013 | @ @
"[54:30] me011 | So we actually talked about that . Yeah , it 's plenty bad ."
[54:31] me013 | plenty bad .
[54:32] me013 | @ @
"[54:33] me011 | It 's plenty bad just with digits , although I haven't trained any nets on it ."
[54:33] me055 | Mmm .
[54:33] fe016 | Yeah .
[54:34] me055 | Mmm .
[54:36] me011 | I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets
[54:40] me011 | since we don't have enough data yet .
"[54:44] me011 | One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four ."
"[54:45] me025 | Yeah , it 's TI - digit strings ."
[54:48] me011 | M that sorta thing .
[54:48] me013 | I swear we had some .
[54:51] me011 | Yeah . But what were they ?
"[54:51] me056 | How how long are how long chunks are they , a"
[54:53] me025 | it 's like but from one to one to nine digits .
[54:56] me025 | It is actually the the actual digit strings from TI - digits .
"[54:59] me056 | OK , yeah , I 've never looked over the TI - digits corpus , I don't know ."
"[54:59] me011 | I I just extracted exactly the same ones , so ."
[55:00] me025 | OK .
[55:01] me055 | Up a bit .
[55:06] me025 | Yeah .
[55:07] me055 | Yeah .
"[55:07] me011 | Greasy wash water , oh ."
[55:09] me055 | In one ear .
"[55:12] me055 | Just the order , OK ?"
"[55:15] me011 | But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them ."
"[55:19] me011 | Since you know what you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it ."
[55:23] me056 | Mm - hmm .
[55:23] me011 | So I have tools for doing that .
[55:37] fe008 | We could do some digits .
[55:40] me011 | Well I I don't have any of the print outs .
[55:42] fe008 | OK .
[55:43] me011 | I I print them out a a as I need them . So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here but I haven't done that .
"[55:48] me013 | We could do a string perhaps @ @ , yeah , let 's @ @ ."
[55:50] fe008 | That 's what I was wondering .
"[55:50] fe016 | Eh yeah , you could write write them write something on the board and , I don't know ."
"[55:52] fe008 | Ha - wha I mean , we could just make make numbers up , can't we ?"
[55:54] me011 | It 's it 's a different task . It 's a different task than read .
"[55:54] fe016 | Yeah , yeah ."
[55:57] me011 | You you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not .
[55:58] me055 | @ @
[56:00] fe008 | OK .
"[56:01] me011 | So ,"
[56:02] fe016 | Right .
"[56:02] me011 | I guess we could write them down and then read them , but ."
[56:04] me055 | Mm - hmm .
[56:06] fe008 | OK .
[56:07] me025 | I @ @
"[56:07] me011 | I I we can get digits . I mean , a as you said , we don't have to be in a meeting ."
"[56:10] me011 | And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway , drag them in here , and have them read digits for me ."
"[56:19] fe008 | Oh , can you bring them up from the no , OK ."
[56:22] fe008 | Alright .
"[56:22] fe008 | I wanted to ask about also the air conditioning . Are uh , is there a plan to to turn the air conditioning off in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on ?"
"[56:28] fe016 | Yeah , it 's way too cold in here ."
[56:30] me025 | We should do that cuz y you can turn it off on that that thing right there and it makes a huge difference .
[56:32] me055 | Right .
"[56:33] me011 | Well ,"
"[56:33] me055 | You also gain noise from the projector as well , isn't it ? Yeah , yeah ."
"[56:33] me011 | the the hum we hear right now is actually the projector , not the air conditioner . The projector is much louder than the air conditioning ."
"[56:36] me025 | But the projector , yeah . This is the first time we 've done it with a projector ."
[56:37] me056 | Huh .
"[56:40] fe008 | Yeah , but I was just thinking , he was showing it on what he showed us on the web site , you could see the contribution of the air conditioning . And I just wondered if that was gonna be sometimes clear ."
[56:44] me011 | Yep .
[56:46] me056 | But the projector 's not part of your
[56:49] me056 | meeting or or or is it ? Do is this normally gonna be on during collection ?
"[56:52] me011 | Um , no , not normally , not for our meetings . I at least"
[56:56] me011 | very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer .
[56:56] me055 | No ?
[57:01] me055 | Mmm .
[57:01] me011 | Right .
[57:02] me055 | It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way . Doesn't it ?
"[57:05] me011 | That 's right , from volume . That 's interesting ."
[57:05] me055 | Yeah .
"[57:06] me055 | For volume , it 's a point source pretty much , yeah ."
[57:07] fe016 | Mmm .
"[57:08] fe008 | Hmm , hmm ."
[57:09] me055 | So .
"[57:09] me011 | Although unfortunately , you know ,"
"[57:11] me011 | they 're all pretty close , right ?"
[57:12] me055 | Hmm .
"[57:17] fe008 | Oh wow , there you go . Perfect ."
[57:18] mn038 | Mm - hmm !
"[57:19] mn038 | Oh , I see ."
"[57:21] fe016 | See , you may wanna call up your computer . "" Computer , give us digit strings . """
"[57:24] me055 | Digit strings , yeah ."
[57:24] me011 | That 's right .
"[57:25] me025 | Wow , but the c but the recorder just crashed ."
[57:27] fe008 | I think I recognize those .
[57:27] me011 | Oh no !

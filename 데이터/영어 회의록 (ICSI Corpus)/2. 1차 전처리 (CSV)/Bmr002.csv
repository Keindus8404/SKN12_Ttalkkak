[00:03] me011 | OK . So .
[00:07] me011 | I 'm talking on mike two .
"[00:09] me011 | So ,"
[00:10] me011 | Which channel is that ?
"[00:12] me025 | Um ,"
[00:12] me025 | do it again .
"[00:13] me011 | Mike number two , I 'm talking right now on ?"
[00:15] me011 | Mike number two ?
[00:16] me025 | That 's in channel one .
[00:17] me011 | Channel one ?
[00:19] me025 | Channel one .
[00:20] me025 | Let me make sure .
[00:20] me022 | Channel one .
[00:21] me025 | There 's only one connection element .
[00:23] me011 | which is zero - based or one - based ?
[00:24] me025 | It 's zero - based .
"[00:28] me011 | OK , So we 're not going to do that . OK ."
[00:32] me025 | This this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes .
[00:37] me022 | off by one .
[00:38] me025 | Consistently not equal to the numbers numbers on the channels .
[00:40] me022 | Right .
"[00:40] me011 | Wh - that 's why I wanted to write it down ,"
[00:42] me011 | but
[00:46] fe008 | Well
"[00:46] me025 | Well , you can write it down ."
[00:47] me025 | I mean Write down whatever you like .
[00:47] me011 | Thank you .
[00:50] fe008 | Write down that poem .
"[00:52] fe008 | Let us know when you 're done , though"
"[00:55] fe008 | Now , how do you do the mike ?"
[00:57] fe008 | I keep getting it in my nose .
[00:57] me025 | I don't know .
[00:58] me025 | You can do whatever any way you like .
[01:00] fe008 | Oh ! I like this .
[01:02] me025 | The weird thing is that
[01:03] me025 | um it means that it
[01:04] me011 | OK .
[01:05] me011 | Fine .
[01:06] me025 | I think it 's probably the better solution .
"[01:08] fe008 | I like this , this is much more comfortable ."
[01:10] me025 | OK ?
[01:10] me011 | Testing .
[01:12] fe008 | I could have it more at the midline .
[01:13] fe008 | Boy ! It 's very adjustable now .
[01:16] me022 | So go ahead .
[01:16] fe008 | I 'm on number four .
[01:17] me025 | Do we have the numbers ?
"[01:18] me025 | the the sheets , that we did from last time ? so we can do them again ?"
[01:20] me022 | So we can do them again ? Yeah .
[01:20] me011 | Yep .
[01:21] me011 | They 're in the folder right there .
[01:22] me025 | Great .
[01:23] fe008 | May I pass the folder to Dan ?
[01:24] me011 | You may .
[01:25] fe008 | OK .
"[01:25] me011 | So , Jane , can you talk into your mike ? You said it 's mike four ?"
[01:28] fe008 | I 'm mike I 'm on mike four .
"[01:32] fe008 | and it 's a very nice microphone ,"
[01:33] fe008 | very modern .
"[01:33] me011 | Well , hmm ,"
[01:34] me011 | I 'm glad you like it .
[01:35] fe008 | I like it very much .
[01:37] me011 | @ @ Uh
"[01:39] me011 | Eric , what mike are you ?"
"[01:42] me022 | Mike one , channel zero , probably ."
[01:45] me011 | Looks like it . S talk again ?
[01:46] me022 | Channel zero .
[01:47] me011 | Thank you .
[01:50] me025 | I 'm on uh
[01:52] me025 | mike three .
"[01:53] me025 | This is mike three ,"
[01:54] me025 | coming in here .
[01:55] me025 | It 's moving around as I move my head
[01:56] me025 | backwards and forwards .
[01:57] me025 | So that 's just the way it goes . That 's life .
[02:00] me025 | That 's just what it does .
[02:01] me011 | OK .
[02:03] fe008 | You didn't get the s head restraint with your system ?
[02:05] me025 | That 's right .
[02:06] me022 | Head restraint system ?
[02:07] fe008 | I did modify my
[02:08] fe008 | my mike uh distance from my
"[02:13] me011 | Um , can you do taps on the P D As ?"
[02:14] fe008 | Slightly .
[02:15] me022 | OK .
[02:16] me011 | and the
[02:16] me025 | OK .
[02:17] me011 | P Z Ms ? And you have to actually check what the nu
[02:18] me025 | P Z Ms ? or or not P Z Ms ?
[02:20] me011 | The -
[02:20] me011 | Start with P Z Ms .
[02:25] me011 | Thank you .
[02:27] me025 | Let 's list them in order .
[02:28] me022 | OK .
[02:28] me025 | PZM number three was the furthest away .
[02:36] me025 | PZ -
[02:37] me025 | What - Can you can you see other stuff happening ?
[02:39] me025 | This is PZM number four .
[02:42] me011 | Thanks .
[02:43] fe008 | That 's a good way .
[02:43] me022 | OK .
[02:44] me022 | This is PZM two .
[02:49] me011 | Thank you .
[02:51] me022 | And this is PZM one .
[02:52] me025 | which is closest to the machine room .
[02:55] fe008 | Should I draw a map ?
[02:57] fe008 | OK .
[02:59] me025 | I don't know .
"[03:03] me025 | We could actually give these sides names , right ?"
"[03:08] me025 | I know , but I 'm just asking ."
[03:09] fe008 | He 's labelling he 's labelling right now .
[03:10] me022 | He 's ?
[03:10] me011 | Ah .
[03:11] me025 | This is this is PDA left .
[03:11] fe008 | Now .
[03:15] me011 | Yep .
[03:16] me025 | And this is PDA right .
[03:18] me011 | All OK .
[03:19] me025 | They will
[03:19] me011 | Thank you .
[03:20] me025 | vary in future .
[03:22] fe008 | OK .
[03:22] me022 | Right .
[03:23] me011 | Did we just record all that ? Should we start it over ?
[03:24] me025 | shows more consistency then .
[03:26] me025 | No .
[03:26] me011 | OK .
"[03:28] me025 | Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now , cuz we 've got"
[03:30] me025 | built - in downsampling now .
[03:32] fe008 | We have what ? What do we have ?
[03:33] me025 | We 've got built - in downsampling .
[03:37] me022 | Wait a second .
[03:38] me025 | We 're not select We 're not recording the empty channels .
[03:39] me011 | The ones that aren't filled out are the ones you want to hand out .
[03:42] me025 | What about the ones that we didn't record ?
"[03:44] me011 | I threw the ones out , that we already"
[03:47] me022 | Oh .
[03:48] me022 | OK .
[03:48] me025 | OK ?
"[03:49] me022 | Well , then , fine ."
[03:49] me025 | Fine .
"[03:50] me025 | Then it doesn't matter , does it ."
[03:51] fe008 | Well done .
[03:51] me022 | See if we care .
[03:51] fe008 | Well done .
[03:56] me022 | OK .
[03:56] fe008 | You 're probably wondering why I
[04:00] me022 | Right .
[04:00] me022 | But before w
[04:01] me025 | Before that .
[04:02] me011 | Right .
[04:02] me011 | So the first task is to read some digits .
[04:02] me022 | Before that .
[04:05] fe008 | Yeah .
[04:05] me011 | So I 'll go ahead and start .
[04:07] me011 | This is Adam on
"[04:09] me011 | mike number two ,"
"[04:51] me011 | So . If you could just fill out the form , and then"
"[04:54] me011 | later on we 'll read it ,"
[04:55] me011 | with pauses between .
[04:56] fe008 | Good .
[04:57] me011 | And we 're session two .
"[05:02] me022 | Do you wanna read next , or d ?"
[05:03] fe008 | n
[05:03] me011 | Let her fill it out and go ahead and read .
"[05:04] fe008 | Yeah , I 'd like to hear one more ."
[05:05] me022 | uh
[05:06] me022 | OK .
"[05:07] me022 | Um , this is Eric on"
"[05:09] me022 | mike one ,"
"[05:10] me022 | the wireless lapel , channel zero ."
"[05:12] me022 | um ,"
[06:05] fe008 | Could I hear you next ?
[06:05] me025 | OK .
"[06:06] me025 | So , this is Dan"
"[06:07] me025 | on mike three ,"
"[06:09] me025 | wireless headset , I 'm wearing it around my neck ."
[06:11] me025 | which may be different than wearing it on the head .
[06:56] fe008 | OK .
"[06:57] fe008 | So , basically they 're kind of like sentences but with n"
[06:59] fe008 | numbers instead of words . OK .
"[07:01] fe008 | So , I 'm I 'm on uh number four"
[07:03] fe008 | with the microphone around my neck
[07:05] fe008 | and I will
[07:06] fe008 | read these .
[07:07] me011 | So you wanna pause briefly between each one
[07:09] me011 | so that the person transcribing can tell where one ends and one begins .
[07:12] fe008 | OK .
"[07:13] me011 | So , a short sentence between each line ."
[07:14] fe008 | It really sounds like sentences .
[07:16] fe008 | somewhat like sentence intonation .
"[07:16] me011 | Well , you can intone it however you want . Imagine that you 're"
[07:18] fe008 | OK .
[07:19] fe008 | Yeah ?
[07:19] me011 | reading a number phone number to someone .
[07:28] me011 | Yep .
"[07:30] fe008 | Um ,"
[08:14] me011 | OK .
[08:14] me011 | Good . Thanks .
[08:14] me025 | Great .
[08:15] me011 | So we 'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting .
[08:17] me011 | just to get some more digits .
[08:17] me025 | OK .
[08:17] me022 | Right .
[08:18] me025 | It 's kind of weird .
"[08:19] me011 | And , uh"
[08:22] me022 | OK .
[08:22] me011 | Thank you .
"[08:24] fe008 | If I were to be dictating a phone number , I would have done that"
"[08:26] fe008 | more slowly , but"
[08:28] fe008 | which would have been
"[08:29] fe008 | of course ,"
[08:30] fe008 | for the machine .
[08:31] fe008 | But .
[08:31] me022 | Sure .
[08:31] fe008 | Was that an OK pace ?
[08:32] me022 | Yeah . It 's fine .
"[08:33] me025 | That was great , what you did ."
[08:34] me025 | Um
[08:34] fe008 | OK .
"[08:36] fe008 | you know ,"
"[08:36] me011 | What - what 's your mike number , Jane ?"
[08:36] fe008 | uh within the constraints .
[08:38] fe008 | Number four .
"[08:40] fe008 | Oh ,"
[08:40] fe008 | Sorry .
[08:44] me011 | Dan doesn't remember what sex he is .
"[08:46] me025 | Yeah , cuz I figure no one 's going to be able to figure it out"
"[08:48] me025 | from the from my name . So ,"
"[08:48] me011 | That 's true , it 's it 's really difficult ."
[08:49] me025 | Yeah .
[08:49] fe008 | and the voice . Just no way .
"[08:51] me011 | Well , don't you I I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms in ."
"[08:54] me025 | Oh , right , right , right ."
[08:55] me025 | @ @
"[08:55] me011 | Anyway . So , why did I call you all here ?"
[08:56] fe008 | Yes .
"[08:57] me011 | Um , what I 'd like to talk about is , um"
"[08:57] fe008 | Oh , you did ."
[08:59] me011 | the transcription .
"[09:00] me011 | So , as part of this um project , we need to transcribe these meetings ."
"[09:05] me011 | um , to do training and test and so on ."
"[09:07] me011 | and , uh , so we need"
[09:09] me011 | word transcripts
"[09:10] me011 | and ,"
"[09:11] me011 | uh , speaker change identification ."
"[09:13] me011 | So , speaker ID ."
"[09:15] me011 | And , uh"
"[09:19] me011 | hi Jane ,"
"[09:21] me011 | what tools to use , what other resources you might need ,"
[09:25] me011 | things like just the data format
[09:26] me011 | and
[09:27] me011 | how we 're going to do it .
"[09:29] me022 | So , I 'm just curious how how h"
[09:31] me022 | how exactly you got roped into this .
"[09:36] fe008 | was mentioned when I wasn't around , but I 'm most happy ."
[09:39] me022 | OK . Good .
[09:39] me011 | Oh really ? Cuz Morgan said he asked you .
"[09:41] fe008 | Oh , uh he did ."
[09:42] fe008 | and and I approved .
[09:42] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[09:43] fe008 | but I think that I was
[09:45] fe008 | uh
[09:45] fe008 | proposed before I was asked ?
[09:47] fe008 | And that doesn't matter
[09:47] fe008 | cuz I think there was probably an a
[09:49] me022 | Oh .
[09:49] fe008 | uh
[09:49] me022 | Yeah . That would be m
[09:50] me022 | That would be my fault .
[09:51] fe008 | that I was interested in advance
[09:54] me022 | Right .
[09:54] fe008 | Yeah .
[09:55] me022 | Uh
[09:55] me022 | right .
"[09:56] me011 | And so , one of the first questions is ,"
[09:56] me022 | OK .
"[09:57] me011 | "" do you need help ? """
"[09:59] me025 | Well , hang on ."
[10:00] me022 | Oh ?
[10:00] me011 | That 's not the first question .
[10:01] me022 | OK .
"[10:02] me025 | Well , I guess ."
[10:08] fe008 | once I 'm given the
"[10:09] fe008 | data , I will provide"
[10:10] fe008 | w word - level transcripts
[10:12] fe008 | with
[10:12] me025 | OK .
"[10:12] fe008 | uh indication of speakers ,"
[10:14] fe008 | and
[10:15] fe008 | um
"[10:16] fe008 | I guess speaker change in any case , so"
"[10:17] fe008 | speaker ID ,"
[10:19] fe008 | and words .
[10:20] me022 | OK .
[10:20] me022 | So you 're gonna
[10:20] me022 | do the actual transcription yourself .
[10:22] fe008 | Yeah .
[10:22] me022 | OK .
[10:27] me025 | Are you going to have to make up what you do or do you have a very
[10:30] me025 | clear idea of what you 're going to do ?
[10:32] fe008 | Well
[10:33] me025 | Is this l
[10:36] fe008 | I 've transcribed a lot .
[10:37] me025 | Yeah .
[10:37] fe008 | But um e
"[10:38] fe008 | you know ,"
"[10:40] fe008 | I mean , there are always ways of doing things"
"[10:40] me025 | And ,"
[10:41] fe008 | more efficiently or
[10:43] fe008 | more
[10:44] fe008 | in a more technical technically sophisticated way ?
[10:47] me025 | Yeah .
[10:47] fe008 | Do you have to speak
[10:48] fe008 | true English sentences when you do this ?
"[10:50] me025 | Yeah , because as people are going to be listening to it afterwards and saying"
"[10:52] me025 | "" Oh listen to her . She couldn't even speak true English sentences ! """
"[10:54] fe008 | "" It 's terrible ! """
"[10:56] fe008 | OK ,"
[10:57] fe008 | um
"[10:57] me025 | Oh , you 're meant You 're meant to speak naturally . You 're meant to say"
"[10:59] me025 | "" Oh , I didn't realize we were being recorded ! """
[11:01] me011 | Ah right .
"[11:02] fe008 | "" No one told me that . """
"[11:03] fe008 | "" This microphone , what 's this doing around my neck ? """
[11:06] me025 | It 's just jewelry .
"[11:09] fe008 | OK , so um"
[11:13] fe008 | uh
[11:13] fe008 | i
[11:16] fe008 | uh
"[11:16] fe008 | tape recorder , with a reverse button ."
[11:19] me025 | Yeah .
"[11:19] fe008 | And you just ,"
"[11:19] fe008 | you know , if it 's word level"
[11:22] fe008 | e
[11:22] fe008 | a r
[11:23] fe008 | I just hit the r
[11:24] fe008 | re
[11:25] fe008 | the rewind button
[11:26] fe008 | every couple of words and
[11:28] me025 | Yeah .
[11:29] me025 | Yeah .
[11:29] fe008 | and then
[11:30] fe008 | at the end do a
[11:35] fe008 | with a digitized
[11:36] fe008 | uh record
[11:37] fe008 | you can have control over replay
[11:39] fe008 | through some sort of an interface .
[11:39] me025 | Yeah .
[11:41] fe008 | Um .
[11:41] fe008 | I 've never used one of those . I know it would be an a wonderful idea .
[11:44] fe008 | It 's just
[11:45] fe008 | in awhile .
[11:47] me022 | Right .
"[11:47] me025 | The nice thing about transcribers is they have foot pedals ,"
[11:50] fe008 | Foot pedals ? I 've used transcribing machines .
[11:51] fe008 | That 's fine .
[11:52] fe008 | um
[11:53] fe008 | But I frankly
[11:54] fe008 | didn't find it any more use to me than
[11:55] me025 | Oh .
[11:56] fe008 | my hand - held taperecorder .
[11:58] me025 | I see .
"[11:58] fe008 | However , if we have a transcribing machine"
[12:00] fe008 | I would accept it .
"[12:01] fe008 | The other thing is ,"
"[12:01] fe008 | you know ,"
[12:02] fe008 | getting hold of a transcriber . I think that CogSci has one .
[12:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[12:05] me022 | Yeah .
[12:06] fe008 | And I could probably borrow one .
"[12:06] me022 | Well ,"
[12:06] me025 | I I I actually have one .
[12:06] me022 | one th
[12:07] fe008 | You have one yourself ?
"[12:08] me025 | Well , Sarah has one because she does a lot of"
[12:10] me025 | transcribing of interviews .
"[12:10] fe008 | Oh , super !"
[12:12] me025 | But
[12:13] me025 | The crazy thing is we 'd have to
[12:14] me022 | Oh .
[12:14] me025 | convert the s
[12:15] me025 | we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette .
[12:17] me025 | to use it .
"[12:17] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[12:18] fe008 | OK .
"[12:18] me025 | I mean , given that we 've already"
[12:19] me025 | got them digitally
"[12:21] me025 | you know , it 's quite tempting to use some kind of uh software thing ."
"[12:24] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
[12:25] fe008 | I kn
"[12:27] me011 | Oh ,"
[12:27] me011 | I actually have some foot pedals for the P C .
"[12:29] me022 | Well , that 's what I was gonna say , is"
[12:30] me025 | OK .
"[12:33] fe008 | Oh , that 'd be super ."
[12:34] me025 | What do they connect to ?
"[12:35] me011 | Uh , keyboard ."
[12:36] me011 | and they generate keystrokes .
"[12:37] me025 | Oh , that 's totally cool ."
[12:39] me025 | how do you decide which keystrokes they generate ?
[12:40] me011 | Um
[12:41] me011 | There 's a little program that downloads into it .
[12:43] me011 | Um .
[12:43] me025 | Hmm .
[12:43] me025 | And this is Windows ?
"[12:44] me011 | But the program probably only runs in Windows , although I bet we could"
[12:47] me011 | program it once
[12:49] me025 | Uh - huh .
[12:50] me011 | and then put it on another machine and it would work .
[12:52] me022 | Except for the fact that we would have to unplug it and pow and
[12:53] me011 | I haven't used them .
[12:55] me022 | change it w
[12:56] me022 | Does it lose the memory
[12:57] me022 | once you 've unpowered it ?
[12:58] me011 | I don't know .
[12:59] me011 | I don't think it does .
[13:01] me025 | You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them .
[13:02] me011 | I 'm not using them anymore . I used to use them .
[13:04] me011 | So they 're currently set up
"[13:05] me011 | for Shift , Control , and Alt ."
[13:07] me025 | Yeah .
[13:08] me011 | But I r I don't use them . They 're not even plugged in .
[13:11] me025 | Wow .
[13:12] me025 | That 's so cool .
[13:13] me025 | OK .
[13:14] fe008 | This sounds wonderful .
"[13:15] me011 | And so tha uh if that would help , uh I 'm certainly willing to donate them ."
"[13:15] me025 | Well ,"
"[13:17] me025 | the d the well , the uh"
[13:22] me022 | Right .
"[13:23] fe008 | Yeah , that 's true ."
"[13:24] me011 | And it it is a PC connection , so it would have to go on a P C somewhere ."
"[13:24] fe008 | Well ,"
[13:28] me025 | Yeah .
"[13:29] fe008 | Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now , and what I was told is that"
[13:30] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:32] fe008 | beginning ,"
"[13:32] fe008 | you know ,"
[13:32] fe008 | that the the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh or f
[13:37] fe008 | half hour to forty minutes of running text .
"[13:39] fe008 | And so , for the pilot thing ,"
"[13:41] fe008 | you know , of course this would be useful ."
"[13:43] me022 | Right , this is the pilot data ."
[13:43] fe008 | And I w I wou I 'm assu
[13:45] fe008 | I 'm assuming that I would not be
"[13:45] me011 | Yeah , yeah , you are generating it ."
[13:46] fe008 | uh
[13:46] fe008 | you know
[13:47] fe008 | e eh uh
[13:48] fe008 | transcribing all of it .
"[13:50] fe008 | So ,"
"[13:50] me011 | Well , that that was part of the question , is that if ,"
[13:53] me025 | Right .
[13:54] me011 | if we 're doing this regularly Imagine we 're doing a couple of hours a week of transcripts
[13:58] fe008 | Yeah .
"[13:58] me011 | um , of recording ,"
"[14:00] me011 | uh , I wouldn't expect you to do it all ."
[14:01] fe008 | No .
"[14:02] fe008 | No , no ."
[14:02] me011 | So the question is do you know of resources that we could use .
[14:05] me011 | So are there grad students or undergrads or just
[14:05] fe008 | Yes .
[14:08] me011 | commercial services ?
[14:08] fe008 | I 've been involved with some of that .
"[14:09] fe008 | At at CogSci ,"
"[14:11] fe008 | So , Susan E"
"[14:12] fe008 | Susan Ervin - Tripp ,"
[14:12] fe008 | who you know
"[14:13] fe008 | um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads"
[14:17] me022 | Hmm .
[14:17] fe008 | to
[14:18] fe008 | do this kind of thing
[14:19] fe008 | and they c
"[14:20] fe008 | you know ,"
[14:23] fe008 | and make it interesting for them
[14:24] fe008 | they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s
"[14:26] fe008 | or , not two ninety - eight , what is it , one whatever ,"
[14:28] fe008 | undergraduate research credit .
[14:30] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:30] me011 | Oh , really ?"
"[14:31] me011 | So we only have to give them credits ,"
[14:32] me011 | We don't have to give them money ?
"[14:34] fe008 | Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for you know ."
[14:36] fe008 | of some of some sort . What I mean is it 's not necessarily monetary .
"[14:37] me011 | Oh , you do have to pay them ."
[14:37] me022 | Awesome .
"[14:39] fe008 | But if they feel like they 're getting something out of it ,"
[14:39] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:41] fe008 | sometimes you can do it that way .
[14:42] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:42] fe008 | And otherwise , as part of a grant ,"
[14:44] fe008 | you can do it .
[14:45] fe008 | some sort of
[14:45] me025 | Yeah .
[14:45] fe008 | minimal
[14:46] fe008 | wage .
"[14:48] me011 | We need to find out how much that will cost , so I can pass that on to Morgan ,"
[14:50] fe008 | Yeah .
[14:51] me011 | cuz right now we have almost no money .
"[14:52] fe008 | Yeah , OK ."
"[14:53] me011 | So so the cheaper we can do it , the better ."
[14:55] fe008 | OK .
"[14:55] fe008 | Well , you also want to get quality ."
"[14:57] me025 | Yeah , absolutely ."
"[14:59] fe008 | Either a higher level person will have to pass through , or you have to be sure you get"
[15:01] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:01] fe008 | good quality
[15:02] me011 | Right .
[15:02] fe008 | to begin with .
"[15:04] fe008 | But um ,"
[15:06] fe008 | That 's been
[15:07] fe008 | done .
[15:07] fe008 | I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp
[15:07] me025 | Yeah .
"[15:11] fe008 | Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally ."
[15:13] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:14] me025 | What 's her name ?
[15:15] fe008 | Uh
[15:16] fe008 | uh Doctor Susan Ervin - Tripp .
[15:17] me025 | OK .
"[15:18] fe008 | faculty member in Psychology , recently retired ,"
[15:20] me025 | Uh - huh .
[15:22] fe008 | and very well known in discourse analysis .
"[15:23] me025 | Oh , OK . So , the p"
"[15:24] me025 | I mean , what I 'm"
[15:25] me025 | hearing is that
[15:27] me025 | the
[15:28] me025 | problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts
"[15:33] me025 | I mean , it 's not a it 's not an unfamiliar problem ."
"[15:35] fe008 | Oh , it 's very common ."
"[15:36] me025 | So that I mean that basically ,"
"[15:40] me025 | adopt them and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost ,"
[15:42] me025 | We 're we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in
[15:45] me025 | bringing down the cost cuz probably
[15:46] me025 | the low cost solution 's already been established .
[15:48] me025 | And so that 's just whatever it is .
[15:49] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[15:49] me025 | That 's
[15:49] me025 | how we 'll do it .
[15:51] me025 | See what I mean ?
[15:51] fe008 | I think there 's always this question of the trade - off between uh
"[15:54] fe008 | paying more for the first pass ,"
[15:55] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[15:56] fe008 | and then h
[15:56] fe008 | and then editing less later .
[15:56] me025 | Uh - huh .
[15:58] fe008 | or
[15:59] fe008 | paying less the first pass and editing more later . So
[16:01] me025 | Yeah .
"[16:02] me025 | Well ,"
[16:05] me025 | I mean the only thing is
[16:11] me025 | than what 's been done in the past
[16:12] me025 | than discourse analyzers
[16:13] me025 | because
[16:15] me025 | maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align
"[16:17] me025 | you know , how much time aligned detail we need"
[16:20] me025 | and uh how much detail in terms of people .
"[16:21] fe008 | Oh ,"
[16:21] fe008 | But that 's a s
[16:22] fe008 | Mm - hmm . OK .
[16:23] me025 | I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail .
[16:25] me025 | I think we just have
[16:26] me025 | basically one text file which runs from beginning to end .
[16:29] me025 | But .
"[16:29] me011 | Well , if in terms of transcripts , sure , but in terms of speaker change it might be"
[16:33] me011 | nice to get the actual
[16:35] me011 | time .
[16:36] me025 | Sure .
[16:38] me011 | Right .
"[16:39] me022 | Well , OK . So what happened with Switchboard"
[16:41] me022 | was
"[16:42] me022 | at least ,"
"[16:43] me022 | I mean , the output"
[16:44] me022 | was that they had
[16:46] me022 | speaker turns
[16:47] me022 | and they
[16:48] me022 | um
"[16:50] me022 | analyzed it in terms of ,"
"[16:51] me022 | you know , "" this is where this speaker change came in """
[16:53] me022 | and of course that gets really
"[16:55] me022 | difficult when you 're talking about I mean , this is some of the stuff that you were"
[16:56] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[16:58] me022 | talking about in
[17:00] me022 | uh
"[17:01] me022 | your lunch talk , is that is that"
[17:02] me025 | Right .
"[17:03] me022 | you know , you get backchannels and stuff like that , that"
"[17:06] me022 | that ,"
"[17:07] me022 | you know , disrupt the"
[17:08] me022 | um
[17:09] me022 | the
[17:09] me025 | Yeah .
[17:10] me022 | segment you know the
"[17:11] me025 | Right , I mean ,"
[17:11] me022 | segmentation .
[17:14] me025 | In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it with
[17:18] me025 | actually people
[17:19] me025 | are less flexible in what they do . In this kind of situation where
[17:22] me025 | we 've got
[17:23] me025 | nonverbal
[17:24] me025 | channels
[17:24] me025 | then there 's a lot of overlap
[17:26] me025 | and there 's just that it 's not a very good model .
[17:27] me022 | Right .
"[17:28] me011 | Oh ,"
"[17:29] me011 | in terms of data format , what are we going to do about that ?"
"[17:31] me011 | I mean ,"
"[17:32] me011 | you have the S T M format , where you have"
"[17:35] me011 | you know , every phrase , every utterance is is"
[17:37] me011 | a single speaker .
"[17:40] me025 | Well ,"
"[17:40] me025 | every utterance is a single speaker , right ?"
[17:42] me025 | It 's just that utterances can overlap .
"[17:44] me025 | I mean ,"
[17:44] me011 | Is that the right way to do it ?
[17:46] me025 | I think so .
[17:47] me011 | OK .
"[17:49] me025 | Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence ,"
[17:51] me025 | and that should be like one
[17:52] me025 | utterance
[17:53] me025 | and then I had a couple of backchannels in there
"[17:59] me011 | OK . So that means that for each utterance , we 'll need the time marks ,"
[18:03] me022 | Right .
[18:03] me011 | the start and end of each utterance .
[18:05] fe008 | Yeah .
[18:05] me022 | So .
"[18:05] me025 | Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere"
"[18:09] me025 | I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us"
[18:11] me025 | if we
[18:11] me025 | give them software
[18:12] me025 | but
[18:12] me025 | we may not
[18:13] me025 | in which case we 'll have to get them
"[18:14] me025 | some other way , like with forced alignment later , I mean"
[18:16] me025 | you know all this can be done .
[18:17] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[18:21] me022 | the tools that Mississippi State has .
[18:23] me025 | Yeah .
"[18:23] me022 | Because , I d I I know that they published"
[18:27] me022 | um
"[18:29] me022 | annotation tools ,"
"[18:30] me022 | you know , for their ins"
"[18:30] me011 | Well , X Waves have some as well , but they 're pretty low level ."
[18:33] me022 | Yeah .
[18:35] me025 | Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions . Yeah .
[18:35] me011 | for phoneme - level
[18:40] me011 | that could be used for speaker change marking .
[18:43] me025 | There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools . There 's a some web
[18:45] fe008 | Yes .
"[18:46] me025 | page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something ."
[18:48] fe008 | Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se ? or are y
[18:48] me022 | OK .
"[18:51] me025 | I mean , I just there are there are a lot of"
[18:52] fe008 | Yeah .
[18:52] me025 | a lot of @ @ these things .
"[18:54] fe008 | There are two projects , which"
[18:55] fe008 | are
"[18:56] fe008 | international ,"
"[18:57] fe008 | huge projects focused on this kind of thing ,"
[18:59] fe008 | actually .
"[19:00] fe008 | One of them 's MATE ,"
[19:01] fe008 | one of them 's EAGLES .
[19:02] fe008 | and um .
"[19:02] me025 | Oh , EAGLES ."
"[19:03] me025 | Yeah , that 's the European one ."
[19:04] me025 | Yeah .
"[19:04] fe008 | You know , I saw I know you know about the big book ."
[19:07] me022 | Yeah .
[19:08] me025 | Mmm .
[19:08] me022 | Yeah .
[19:11] fe008 | And um
[19:12] fe008 | and they have
[19:14] fe008 | and
[19:14] fe008 | MATE is a project which is
[19:16] fe008 | being run out of Denmark
[19:17] fe008 | and
[19:18] fe008 | um
[19:19] fe008 | big
"[19:20] fe008 | uh ,"
"[19:20] fe008 | e you know ,"
[19:21] fe008 | a work bench or something or other . And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them .
[19:23] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:25] fe008 | So , I mean , there are things that"
[19:26] fe008 | in terms of like the time alignment issue
[19:28] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:28] fe008 | I mean , you guys are more expert on that ,"
"[19:30] fe008 | I mean ,"
"[19:30] fe008 | than I am ,"
[19:31] fe008 | but I want to say that
"[19:32] fe008 | I know for a fact , I keep running across these ,"
[19:34] fe008 | and those would be my first two choices of looking at .
[19:36] fe008 | EAGLES and MATE .
[19:36] fe008 | And I have the documentation downstairs .
[19:38] me011 | OK .
[19:38] fe008 | I didn't think to bring it .
[19:39] me011 | Ha - Have you looked at it already ?
"[19:41] fe008 | Oh , I have , but I wasn't interested in that particular issue ."
[19:43] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:44] fe008 | So , we 're talking now ,"
[19:45] fe008 | once you have words
"[19:46] fe008 | you know , how do you time align it ."
[19:47] fe008 | and that 's .
"[19:47] me011 | Oh . So , these are p particularly for time alignment ?"
"[19:51] fe008 | So , MATE and EAGLES are both within the so - called"
"[19:53] fe008 | uh Language Engineering branch ,"
[19:56] fe008 | and um
[19:58] fe008 | so they 're intended for this kind of a
[20:00] me025 | Yeah .
[20:01] fe008 | comp compu s computer science application type of approach . These are not discourse types of tools .
[20:06] me025 | Right .
[20:06] fe008 | So .
[20:07] me011 | Right . are they just for time alignment or are they for
[20:09] me011 | transcription as well ?
"[20:09] fe008 | Can I be excused ,"
[20:10] fe008 | and I 'll go down and get my stuff ?
[20:12] me025 | You don't Just take the thing with you .
[20:14] me011 | Th - i
[20:14] fe008 | Are you serious ?
"[20:15] me025 | Well ,"
"[20:16] me025 | I don't know what will happen , but you may as well ."
"[20:17] fe008 | I but but what uh I mean ,"
[20:20] me025 | Sure . Sure . Sure .
[20:20] me011 | Sure .
[20:20] me022 | Sure .
[20:20] fe008 | OK . And I go get my books and I 'll be right back .
[20:22] fe008 | I didn't think of bringing this .
[20:25] me025 | My uh
[20:27] me022 | We can hear all your conversations along the way .
[20:27] me025 | My s
"[20:29] fe008 | I 'll try not to say , "" So , Oh dear ,"
[20:29] me025 | Yeah .
"[20:30] fe008 | Boy ! That 's itching there ! "" So ,"
"[20:33] me025 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[20:35] me025 | You can leave it behind as well if you want .
"[20:40] me011 | So ,"
[20:42] me011 | For the d
"[20:42] me025 | I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing , right ?"
[20:45] me011 | Right .
[20:45] me025 | So they probably will have tools to address the actual
"[20:47] me025 | the the the transcriber support and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you , which is , you know , exactly the problem we have . So ."
[20:52] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:55] me022 | Right , but we can do automated alignment . That 's not a problem"
[20:57] me025 | Right .
[20:58] me022 | I think
[20:58] me025 | Right .
[20:59] me025 | But then again we don't have to do it .
"[21:02] me011 | Well , I 'm not sure if we can do automated alignment or not ."
"[21:06] me011 | I mean ,"
[21:07] me022 | I th
[21:11] me011 | a prayer .
"[21:13] me025 | Oh sure , we are . We 've got individual microphones ."
"[21:15] me022 | to get the r to get the actual transcript , I think"
[21:18] me022 | because of the separate channels .
"[21:20] me011 | Oh , that 's true . Right . We could just do it through these ."
[21:22] me025 | Yeah .
[21:22] me022 | Right .
[21:23] me011 | I hadn't even thought about that . Sure .
[21:25] me011 | Um .
"[21:26] me011 | In terms of data formats , uh"
[21:28] me011 | what I did for the Digits stuff was just
[21:30] me011 | to hand - rolled my own .
[21:31] me011 | That looks like this form .
"[21:33] me011 | You know , it 's just uh something that 's easy to parse in Perl ."
[21:36] me011 | Um .
[21:37] me011 | Probably for
"[21:38] me011 | the full one , we 'll want to do something like S T M ."
"[21:42] me011 | I mean , some format that our tools already work with ."
[21:42] me025 | Yeah .
"[21:44] me025 | Well ,"
"[21:47] me025 | Yes ,"
[21:48] me025 | although that might @ @
[21:50] me025 | we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between .
[21:53] me022 | Right .
"[21:53] me011 | Yeah , presumably ."
"[21:53] me025 | When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM , but"
"[21:57] me025 | rather than rather than designing our own format ,"
[21:58] me025 | we 'll just take whatever
"[21:59] me025 | comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think ."
"[22:02] me011 | Yeah , I guess that 's true ."
[22:03] me011 | Yeah .
[22:03] me025 | I I I 've got no idea
[22:03] me022 | Right .
[22:05] me025 | what that 'll look like .
[22:06] me025 | but
[22:07] me025 | on our speaker phones .
[22:08] me022 | I know that um
"[22:11] me022 | the Mississippi State tools , at least th what the produce"
[22:13] me022 | does not come out in STM format .
[22:15] me025 | Right .
[22:15] me022 | They they basically give
[22:18] me022 | um
[22:19] me022 | They subdivide into WAVE files
"[22:23] me022 | oh , you know ,"
"[22:24] me022 | a WAVE file that g indicates where the start and stop times are ,"
[22:27] me025 | Mmm - hmm .
[22:28] me022 | um
[22:29] me022 | and then give the
[22:30] me022 | uh
[22:31] me022 | the
[22:32] me025 | Yeah .
[22:32] me022 | sentence information .
[22:33] me022 | But
[22:34] me022 | I mean
[22:35] me022 | Ni - i
"[22:36] me022 | as you said , it was easy to convert"
[22:38] me022 | back and forth between
[22:40] me022 | um
"[22:41] me022 | that file and STM format ,"
"[22:42] me022 | in fact what I did is I took the Mississippi State data ,"
[22:45] me022 | and just made STM files out of it .
[22:47] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[22:48] me025 | OK .
[22:49] me025 | Good .
"[22:50] me011 | OK . "" MATE Mark - up Framework "" . OK ?"
[22:51] me025 | Right .
"[22:52] fe008 | "" Specification of uh Coding workbench "" ,"
[22:55] me022 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:55] fe008 | That 's one o thing , and then , back in here"
"[22:57] me011 | Oh , no ! It has the word "" X M L "" in it !"
[23:01] me025 | It must be It must be fundable then .
[23:05] fe008 | This is the
[23:06] me022 | Looks like uh work packages .
[23:07] me022 | Must be a European project .
[23:07] me025 | Yeah .
"[23:08] me025 | Oh , yeah ."
[23:09] me025 | @ @
"[23:09] fe008 | Yeah , it is European . Both of these are Eur - European ,"
[23:11] fe008 | but they have
"[23:12] fe008 | you know , American contributions , and stuff ."
"[23:14] me022 | Oh , so they 're using the Alembic"
"[23:15] me022 | Workbench , from Mitre ."
[23:17] me025 | Alembic ?
[23:18] me022 | I guess .
[23:18] fe008 | Yeah .
[23:18] me011 | Is that free ?
[23:20] me022 | I don't know .
[23:20] fe008 | Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things .
[23:26] fe008 | Let me show y
"[23:27] fe008 | Have you seen this one , Dan ?"
[23:29] me025 | No .
"[23:31] fe008 | Oh , you 've got one ."
[23:31] fe008 | What are you looking at here ?
[23:33] fe008 | He 's got the Mark - up Framework .
"[23:34] fe008 | Oh , yeah ."
[23:35] fe008 | Different coding schemes .
[23:36] me011 | But it doesn't have enough pictures .
"[23:37] me011 | So , I think"
[23:37] fe008 | OK .
[23:37] me011 | it will require too much reading to understand whether this is anything
"[23:39] me022 | Oh ,"
"[23:39] me022 | this is ,"
[23:40] me022 | I see .
[23:41] me011 | that we can easily use .
[23:43] fe008 | What they 're doing is they 're comp comparing all these existing things that have been submitted and
[23:47] me022 | I see .
"[23:48] fe008 | And it includes , this one includes the TEI and"
[23:50] fe008 | uh
[23:52] fe008 | so it 's it 's um
[23:54] fe008 | pretty broad - based .
"[23:56] me022 | Mitre ,"
[23:56] fe008 | That 's the Text Encoding Initiative .
[23:58] me011 | Oh .
[23:59] fe008 | That 's a way of marking mark - up .
"[24:00] fe008 | so , you know , but focus on tools to do this stuff"
"[24:04] fe008 | um , I do have a file also in addition to those things , but"
[24:08] fe008 | it 'll take me just a second here
"[24:09] me011 | Well , I guess XML"
[24:10] me011 | makes some amount of sense . I 'm not actually familiar with it but
[24:14] me011 | it seems to be the sort of thing
[24:16] me011 | that this would be good for .
[24:19] fe008 | a basic transcription
[24:20] fe008 | and a good filter .
[24:22] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:22] fe008 | I mean , that 's"
[24:25] fe008 | you should be able to translate between
[24:29] me011 | Right .
"[24:30] fe008 | at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly ."
[24:33] fe008 | Oh ! I wanted to m
[24:38] fe008 | is um a query language for research in phonetics where he
[24:41] fe008 | wants to build in ToBI tags and so you can
[24:44] fe008 | determine
[24:45] fe008 | um I wanted to mention this to you . I was
[24:47] fe008 | going to come by and ask you about this .
[24:47] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[24:49] fe008 | Do you know about the Stuttgart um people ?
[24:56] me025 | I don't think so .
[24:56] fe008 | He says that uh in German
"[24:58] fe008 | "" selbst "" is used in two different ways so you have"
"[25:00] fe008 | It either means uh "" himself "" or it means "" even """
[25:03] fe008 | and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation .
[25:03] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:06] fe008 | So ,"
[25:06] me025 | Hmm .
[25:06] fe008 | they have the recordings such that they
[25:09] fe008 | can locate things uh
[25:11] fe008 | with by searching
[25:12] fe008 | for
[25:13] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[25:13] fe008 | part of speech and also
[25:14] fe008 | intonational tags .
"[25:17] fe008 | Anyway , that 's that ."
[25:17] me025 | Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ?
[25:19] fe008 | This is true .
[25:20] fe008 | This is true .
[25:22] fe008 | Which of course is another issue .
[25:23] me025 | Or maybe not .
[25:25] fe008 | Exactly so .
[25:27] fe008 | I have one more thing I need to find .
[25:30] me025 | Well .
[25:30] me022 | But that kind of thing
[25:31] me022 | I think we would probably want to extract automatically .
"[25:34] me022 | I mean ,"
"[25:36] me022 | e this is ,"
[25:36] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:36] me022 | the this is a conversation that we should have with Liz .
[25:38] fe008 | Yes .
[25:39] fe008 | Oh . OK .
"[25:40] me022 | Right ,"
[25:42] me022 | She 's going to be the one who 's the most
[25:44] me022 | concerned about
[25:45] me022 | this kind of thing .
[25:46] fe008 | OK .
[25:47] me022 | And so she may have some ideas .
[25:48] me022 | on on that particular issue .
[25:50] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:50] me011 | Right , but it 's I think for the initial task ,"
[25:52] me011 | just getting the word transcripts and speaker change
[25:53] fe008 | Yeah .
[25:54] me011 | is highest on my list .
"[25:56] fe008 | Well that 's what Morgan mentioned to me , too . I mean , if in terms of"
[25:57] me011 | So .
[25:58] me022 | Yeah .
[25:58] fe008 | But you asked me about uh
[26:00] fe008 | tools and things and um
[26:01] me025 | Yeah .
[26:02] fe008 | There 's this one
[26:03] fe008 | um
"[26:03] fe008 | This is called "" Transcriber "" ."
[26:05] fe008 | um
"[26:05] fe008 | "" binary distribution for for"
[26:07] fe008 | uh
[26:08] fe008 | Linux and Solaris and
"[26:10] fe008 | SGI and Windows "" ."
[26:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[26:11] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[26:12] me025 | Who 's it from ?
[26:15] me025 | Right .
"[26:16] fe008 | "" It allows"
"[26:16] fe008 | to manually segment , label and transcribe speech signals """
"[26:20] fe008 | And ,"
[26:20] me025 | Is it the French one ?
"[26:21] fe008 | uh , let 's see , where did I get this ? I got this from U Penn ."
[26:24] me025 | U Penn .
[26:25] me025 | I think that I 've heard of this one . It was the one that Steve Renals
[26:27] me025 | mentioned .
[26:27] fe008 | It is possible .
[26:29] fe008 | It could be French . I can't really tell .
[26:32] me022 | Can I see that ?
"[26:35] me011 | It sounds like you 're at least a little familiar with these tools , Jane , so"
[26:39] me011 | Are y Do you feel comfortable just picking one ?
[26:41] fe008 | I 've never used any of them .
[26:43] me011 | OK .
[26:43] fe008 | And so um I think it would be something that we should work
"[26:46] fe008 | uh together with , in terms of"
[26:48] me025 | Sure .
[26:48] fe008 | uh
[26:49] me022 | Right .
[26:49] fe008 | Here 's another thing I got .
"[26:50] me022 | Oh , so this 'd this w is"
[26:51] me022 | probably what the L D C uses . I mean they do a lot of transcription at the L D C .
[26:55] fe008 | OK .
[26:58] me022 | what it is they actually use .
[27:00] fe008 | Oh ! Good idea .
"[27:00] me022 | I mean , I know ,"
[27:01] me022 | I mean
[27:01] fe008 | Great idea .
"[27:02] me022 | I 've got contacts up there , so ."
[27:03] me011 | Signed language is interesting .
[27:05] me022 | So .
[27:09] me025 | Can I see ?
[27:10] me022 | Yeah .
"[27:11] fe008 | This is the other think that um This is part of EAGLES , but"
"[27:14] fe008 | um ,"
"[27:15] fe008 | but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this ."
[27:20] fe008 | Why do I feel like I 'm whispering ?
"[27:21] me011 | Well , so , how should we proceed on picking a tool ?"
"[27:24] me011 | Jane , do you want to pick a few and we 'll download them and"
[27:26] me011 | try them out ?
[27:27] me011 | Is that the right thing to do ?
[27:27] fe008 | Oh !
[27:28] fe008 | I think that would be lovely .
"[27:29] fe008 | Now , so , are we talking about"
[27:32] fe008 | uh simply the word
[27:33] fe008 | stage ?
[27:34] fe008 | or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment
[27:37] fe008 | as well ?
"[27:37] me011 | No , we 're not going to do time alignment ."
[27:38] me022 | No .
[27:39] fe008 | OK .
"[27:39] me025 | Well ,"
[27:40] me025 | We are going to do time alignment .
"[27:41] me025 | but we 'll probably do it ourselves , right ?"
[27:46] me022 | Right .
[27:46] me025 | about buying and or
[27:48] me025 | bringing in tools .
[27:48] me022 | We 're very good at time alignments .
[27:49] me025 | We 're not very good but we 're
[27:49] fe008 | OK .
[27:50] me025 | proud of ourselves .
[27:51] me022 | Right . OK .
[27:51] me025 | We 're very proud of our time alignment .
[27:53] fe008 | Absolutely .
"[27:53] fe008 | Yeah ,"
[27:54] fe008 | OK .
[27:55] fe008 | Good .
"[27:55] me011 | but , in terms of what the transcriber needs to do ,"
[27:58] me011 | they 're not going to have to do time alignment .
"[27:59] fe008 | Oh good , OK ."
[28:00] me011 | Except
[28:00] fe008 | Fine .
"[28:03] me025 | Right . I mean , it 's not a bad Oh look !"
[28:05] me025 | It uses Snack !
[28:07] me022 | Uses what ?
[28:08] me025 | It uses Snack .
[28:08] me025 | That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with .
"[28:12] me011 | OK , then we 'll have to use it ."
"[28:12] fe008 | Oh , cool ."
[28:13] fe008 | Very cool .
[28:13] me011 | No no question .
[28:14] me025 | Yeah .
[28:15] me025 | It 's a TCL - based thing . I 'm sure it 's just wonderful .
[28:18] fe008 | Cool .
"[28:19] me025 | Yes , T"
[28:27] fe008 | Cool .
[28:33] me025 | Yeah . It 's the French one .
"[28:34] fe008 | Oh , cool !"
[28:35] me011 | Yeah .
[28:35] fe008 | OK .
[28:35] fe008 | There .
[28:37] me025 | But I 've never downloaded it . Someone mentioned it to me .
"[28:39] me025 | And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me ,"
[28:40] me025 | because they thought I would be excited
[28:41] me025 | because it 's TCL - based .
[28:42] fe008 | Did you see this one ?
"[28:44] fe008 | The - ,"
"[28:49] me011 | OK , So , so , it 's called "" Transcriber "" you said ?"
[28:50] fe008 | OK .
[28:53] me011 | gacks
[28:53] me025 | Transcriber
"[29:01] me022 | So it 's very interest I mean ,"
[29:02] me022 | it 's interesting that
[29:04] me022 | one of the coordinators on that is Mark Liberman
[29:06] me022 | from the LDC
[29:07] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[29:07] fe008 | Yeah .
[29:08] me022 | I don't know what
"[29:09] me022 | "" coordinator "" means"
[29:11] me022 | in in terms of that .
[29:14] me022 | I mean
[29:17] me022 | what is what is what is this web page from ?
"[29:20] fe008 | you know , I roam around"
[29:21] fe008 | on on topics like this
[29:22] me022 | Sure .
[29:23] fe008 | And I think I got this off the U Penn
"[29:25] fe008 | and it does in fact cite a French site , so um"
[29:28] fe008 | they have some sort of an arrangement .
"[29:30] me011 | Well , I just wrote down"
[29:30] me022 | I see .
[29:31] me011 | the French site and I will check it and try to download it
[29:33] me022 | Right .
[29:34] me011 | And uh see what it looks like .
[29:34] fe008 | Good .
"[29:37] fe008 | through the , uh ,"
[29:39] fe008 | I can't remember which
[29:40] fe008 | aspect of U of U Penn I was
[29:42] me022 | Right .
"[29:43] fe008 | following , but"
[29:44] fe008 | It must have been the LDC .
[29:45] fe008 | I I I bet you anything .
[29:46] me022 | Yeah .
[29:50] me011 | I vaguely recall that they have a pages uh tools page
"[29:53] me011 | somewhere ,"
[29:53] fe008 | Mm - hmm . OK .
[29:54] me011 | with like
[29:54] me022 | OK .
[29:55] me011 | lists and lists and lists of uh
[29:56] fe008 | Yes .
[29:56] me011 | various and assorted tools .
"[29:58] fe008 | They have a special project , as I 'm remembering ,"
"[29:59] fe008 | and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse ,"
[30:00] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[30:03] fe008 | they show up in
[30:05] fe008 | resources .
"[30:05] me011 | So ,"
"[30:05] me011 | Um ,"
"[30:06] me011 | we 'll start with "" Transcriber "" and if it looks like that 's not gonna"
[30:13] me011 | we 'll look at something else .
"[30:14] fe008 | I like that very much , and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with"
[30:15] me011 | OK .
"[30:17] fe008 | these larger corp corpus projects . So that , you know , the fact that ,"
[30:19] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[30:20] me025 | Mmm .
[30:20] me022 | Yeah .
"[30:20] fe008 | yeah , it 's U Penn and all that ."
[30:22] fe008 | Yeah .
[30:23] me022 | Right .
"[30:24] me011 | Also , I wanted to mention just in passing that"
[30:26] me011 | uh another thing that we 're going to want to start collecting is queries for the meetings .
"[30:30] me011 | So if over the next couple of days you find yourself wondering what we talked about in the meeting ,"
[30:34] me011 | write down the sort of query you 'd like to make .
"[30:36] fe008 | Oh , good idea ."
[30:37] me011 | Do you understand what I mean ?
[30:38] fe008 | It 's like the PDA thing .
[30:38] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:38] me011 | So ,"
"[30:39] me011 | imagine that we had Meeting Recorder all done ,"
"[30:41] me011 | and you had one ,"
[30:42] me011 | what might you do
[30:44] me011 | with it ?
"[30:47] me011 | So ,"
[30:48] me011 | if they occur to you .
"[30:49] fe008 | So , like"
"[30:50] fe008 | "" did the French system use Tcl ? """
[30:51] me011 | Right .
[30:54] me022 | Actually what I would have
[30:54] me011 | Send m
[30:55] me022 | come up with was
"[30:55] me011 | So , if you could just email me them ."
[30:55] me022 | w w
"[30:56] me022 | "" What was the web address of that thing "" ,"
"[30:58] me011 | Yeah , except we didn't record ."
[30:59] me022 | we didn't record that .
[31:00] me011 | So .
[31:01] me022 | Right .
[31:02] me025 | That 's a fine question .
[31:05] fe008 | if anyone wants to know .
[31:05] me025 | Wow .
"[31:07] me022 | slash slash capital CTA slash , l Yeah ."
[31:08] me011 | s l
"[31:09] me011 | slash lots of other stuff , yeah ."
[31:10] me022 | Yeah .
"[31:10] me025 | So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE"
[31:10] me022 | Right .
[31:14] me025 | project is
[31:15] me025 | a review of a lot of different tools .
"[31:17] fe008 | Yeah , there you go ."
[31:18] fe008 | Exactly .
"[31:18] me025 | They 're actually , they seem to be more"
[31:20] me025 | the tool the main focus of the tools is
[31:22] me025 | you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns
[31:25] me025 | transi transcriptions with uh
[31:28] me025 | discourse roles
[31:29] me025 | and things like that .
[31:29] me022 | I see .
[31:30] me025 | But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well .
[31:33] me025 | And I could be wrong .
[31:38] fe008 | you asking about
"[31:39] fe008 | time aligning the you know , What would you need to indicate"
[31:41] me025 | Right .
[31:41] fe008 | and were there tools for that because
[31:43] fe008 | um
[31:44] fe008 | I suspect that would be
[31:46] fe008 | uh pretty
[31:47] fe008 | time intensive .
"[31:48] fe008 | I also wanted to say , in terms of like"
[31:49] fe008 | disc
"[31:49] fe008 | you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours"
[31:52] fe008 | I do have
[31:54] me022 | Right .
[31:55] fe008 | I 'd like to be involved in that .
"[31:55] me022 | No , right , I didn't mean to imply that"
[31:56] fe008 | Yeah .
"[32:01] fe008 | Oh , not right now , but I mean in the future . So at this meeting with Liz"
[32:02] me022 | Right .
[32:04] me022 | Right .
[32:06] fe008 | I like that stuff .
"[32:07] me022 | Sure , sure ."
"[32:07] me011 | So , when is she showing up ?"
"[32:10] me022 | I mean , they 're coming in April ."
[32:12] me011 | April . OK .
[32:12] me022 | Right .
"[32:13] me022 | But ,"
[32:13] me022 | um
"[32:16] me022 | You know , we we may or may not"
[32:18] me022 | talk before then
[32:18] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[32:19] me022 | on that .
[32:20] me022 | Um .
[32:21] me022 | I I think we won't
"[32:22] me022 | probably talk until we have more data , I would think ."
[32:24] me022 | Right ?
"[32:27] me011 | Right , since we have"
"[32:28] me011 | almost none right now ,"
[32:29] me011 | let 's
[32:29] me022 | Yeah .
[32:31] me011 | We need to move forward from there .
"[32:33] me011 | But uh , yeah , I guess it 's O K ."
"[32:36] me011 | And then , uh"
"[32:42] me011 | Dan and I spoke about this briefly ,"
[32:43] me011 | do we want to try to combine channels somehow
[32:46] me011 | to make the transcriber 's job easier ?
[32:48] me011 | I was listening to some of it and uh
"[32:50] me011 | like , if you just listen to the far"
[32:52] me011 | P Z M
[32:53] me011 | the person sitting at this end of the table you can hardly hear at all .
[33:00] me011 | it may be worthwhile to at least
[33:02] me011 | try a little bit
[33:04] me011 | to combine the channels .
[33:05] me022 | Right .
"[33:08] me025 | Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs , listened to them in stereo ."
[33:12] me011 | Huh . Neat !
[33:12] me025 | And I was very impressed by how
[33:14] me025 | well you could hear
[33:17] me025 | I haven't done very extensive tests .
"[33:20] me011 | Oh , so , that would be"
[33:20] me011 | interesting as well to do that .
[33:21] me022 | Oh !
"[33:21] me022 | Yeah , cuz you 'd get"
[33:23] me025 | you get a certain amount of spatial information .
[33:25] me022 | Right !
[33:27] me022 | Wow .
"[33:27] me011 | Well , I bet if you used"
[33:27] me025 | Gives you some
"[33:32] me011 | Well , maybe , maybe not ."
"[33:33] me025 | Yeah , yeah , you 'd get get wide coverage ."
"[33:34] me022 | Well , you would you would sound like you 'd have like in this e big"
[33:36] me011 | Big ears .
[33:36] me025 | Right . Right .
"[33:37] me025 | But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get"
[33:37] me022 | big head .
[33:41] me025 | You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table .
[33:43] me022 | Right .
[33:43] me025 | So .
[33:43] me011 | Right .
[33:44] me022 | Right .
"[33:48] me011 | OK , do we have anything else to talk about with transcribes ?"
"[33:52] me025 | Well , what is what is the goal ?"
[33:54] me025 | again ?
"[33:57] me025 | I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with"
[33:59] me025 | transcriptions of these meetings .
[34:04] me011 | train a neural net
[34:05] me011 | and
[34:06] me011 | create a recognizer and
[34:09] me011 | do
"[34:11] me025 | Then we 'll be done , huh ?"
"[34:14] me011 | Well , that 's my interest ."
"[34:14] me011 | I mean , other people have different interests , so ."
[34:15] me025 | Um .
[34:17] me011 | That 's what I want .
"[34:19] me025 | Of course , there are different kinds of recos"
[34:21] me025 | so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these
"[34:25] me025 | uh , far - field mikes cuz what we that 's the problem we 're trying to solve ."
[34:26] me011 | Right .
[34:28] me011 | Right .
[34:28] me025 | OK .
"[34:32] me011 | so , the reason we 're doing near field as well is if that doesn't work we wanna back"
[34:36] me025 | and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately .
[34:37] me011 | something that will work .
[34:38] me011 | Right .
[34:40] me011 | Right .
[34:41] me025 | Um .
[34:42] fe008 | So these are near near field ?
[34:43] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[34:43] me025 | Yeah . Yeah . Close mikes .
[34:43] fe008 | there
[34:49] me025 | that What we 're actually going to do with these data is
[34:51] me025 | very unclear to me
[34:53] me011 | Why ?
[34:56] me011 | Y
"[34:58] me011 | The question is , "" is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval ? """
[35:01] me025 | Uh - huh .
"[35:01] me011 | So , w will the application the Meeting Recorder application ,"
[35:05] me011 | work ?
[35:06] me025 | Yeah .
"[35:07] me011 | So ,"
[35:08] me011 | Part of the research is um
"[35:10] me011 | "" is fifty percent"
"[35:12] me011 | accuracy enough to do an useful information retrieval ? """
"[35:16] me022 | Well , part"
[35:17] me011 | It might be .
[35:17] me022 | I
"[35:17] me025 | Well , we know the answer to that ,"
"[35:21] me011 | That 's right ,"
"[35:21] me011 | Well , but you know we have to try ."
[35:23] me025 | Yeah .
[35:23] me011 | We we we could simply not do the project .
[35:25] me011 | But I think that 's a bad solution .
[35:25] me022 | W
[35:26] me022 | We also need to d
"[35:27] me022 | do this in terms of SmartKom ,"
[35:30] me022 | to build general
[35:32] me022 | English acoustic models .
[35:34] me022 | that
[35:35] me022 | can be
"[35:35] me022 | that they can say "" OK here 's the vocabulary and"
"[35:40] me022 | you know , here are the pronunciations ."
"[35:42] me022 | And go to it . """
[35:43] me025 | And are they specifically far field
[35:45] me022 | Yeah .
[35:45] me025 | mikes ?
[35:46] me022 | Yeah .
"[35:46] me011 | Oh , I didn't know that ."
[35:46] me025 | OK .
"[35:48] fe008 | You know , if if we were to add in addition ,"
"[35:50] fe008 | and I 'm offering this ,"
[35:52] fe008 | um
"[35:52] fe008 | to the word level ,"
[35:53] fe008 | also
"[35:55] fe008 | uh , so , stressed words ,"
[35:56] fe008 | within
[35:57] fe008 | utterances
[35:58] me025 | Yeah .
[35:58] fe008 | I do think that that would help the information retrieval .
"[36:02] me025 | Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information"
[36:05] fe008 | OK .
[36:05] me025 | assuming that we actually
"[36:06] me025 | pursue it ,"
[36:07] me025 | but
[36:09] me025 | um
"[36:09] me025 | we 've got a huge problem , because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data ."
"[36:14] fe008 | Oh , good point ."
[36:14] me025 | And um
[36:16] me025 | it 's just eh it 's very frightening .
[36:18] me011 | Yep .
"[36:18] fe008 | So , are are you familiar with this"
[36:20] fe008 | the MARS the MARSEC project ?
"[36:23] fe008 | Um ,"
"[36:24] fe008 | So ,"
"[36:24] fe008 | I 'll put this over here , cuz he seems to be the chairman ."
[36:27] fe008 | Um .
[36:27] me022 | Who ?
"[36:28] me025 | Who , Eric ?"
[36:30] me022 | No .
[36:30] me011 | He has he has the open piece of paper .
[36:30] fe008 | Well
[36:32] fe008 | Uh - huh .
"[36:32] me011 | So ,"
[36:33] me011 | open notebook .
[36:33] fe008 | He Yeah .
[36:35] fe008 | y y
"[36:35] me022 | Well , Dan 's got an open notebook , too ."
[36:36] me025 | Outrageous !
[36:37] me025 | Laying out his folders .
[36:40] me022 | Right .
[36:43] fe008 | has
[36:44] fe008 | time - aligned spoken
[36:48] fe008 | I see it as sort of in - between
[36:50] fe008 | um
[36:51] fe008 | these fields
[36:52] fe008 | because a lot of the time when people do
[36:54] fe008 | rich um
[36:55] fe008 | intonational and and stress - oriented transcription
[36:58] fe008 | they
[36:59] fe008 | don't have the
[37:00] fe008 | digital
[37:01] fe008 | record
[37:01] fe008 | at the same time and the don't have it time - aligned .
[37:02] me025 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:03] fe008 | I don't know how large this is , actually ."
[37:06] fe008 | But I just
[37:07] fe008 | was sort of thinking that um
[37:09] fe008 | I 'm I 'm and it 's British
[37:10] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[37:10] fe008 | And you know
"[37:12] me011 | Well , I think to some extent with things like"
[37:13] fe008 | So .
[37:14] me011 | the stress and the other prosodic
[37:15] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[37:16] me011 | things an and tighter time alignments that we can do
[37:18] me011 | I think
[37:19] me011 | we should probably do those
[37:21] me011 | but only once we have a consumer of that data
[37:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:24] fe008 | OK .
"[37:24] me011 | ' You know , so right now we have a consumer of"
[37:26] me011 | the word transcripts and the
[37:28] me011 | speaker change . Me . I want those things to work .
[37:29] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:31] me011 | And so I would like to get that done as quickly as possible .
[37:33] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:34] fe008 | I 'm d
[37:34] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:35] me011 | if Liz or someone else wants to do some work on
[37:39] me011 | uh
[37:39] me011 | prosody and on stress and so on
[37:42] me011 | then
[37:43] me011 | we can go back to the data and generate the
[37:47] me011 | uh the transcripts that we need .
[37:48] fe008 | OK .
[37:49] fe008 | One thing about that is that is that
[37:50] fe008 | um
[37:51] fe008 | of
[37:51] fe008 | doing the word level ?
[37:53] fe008 | it really is just as easy to put the stress in at that point .
[37:56] me011 | Even for an undergrad ?
"[37:57] fe008 | Oh , oh , well , see"
[37:58] fe008 | in my pilot
"[37:59] fe008 | stuff , so in the half hour or so that I 'm doing ."
"[38:01] fe008 | I 'd just as soon put it in ,"
[38:03] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[38:03] me025 | OK .
"[38:05] fe008 | You know of course , Rosaria 's"
[38:06] fe008 | pursuing this this area
[38:07] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[38:08] fe008 | but I really do think
[38:09] fe008 | from everything that I 've run across that um
[38:12] fe008 | you should get gain
[38:13] fe008 | in terms of the
[38:15] fe008 | uh
[38:15] fe008 | uh
"[38:16] fe008 | what you were saying , the"
[38:17] me011 | Right .
[38:17] fe008 | information retrieval aspects from that .
"[38:20] fe008 | And I wouldn't be too surprised I mean , it 's it 's like uh"
"[38:23] fe008 | I mean I don't know how how reliable Lea is ,"
[38:25] fe008 | but if this idea of islands of of um
[38:28] fe008 | for di whatever they
[38:29] fe008 | are . r
[38:30] fe008 | r islands of reliability or whatever it is .
[38:30] me011 | Accuracy ?
[38:32] fe008 | The stressed w stressed words .
"[38:32] me011 | Certainty , islands of certainty ."
[38:33] fe008 | Is that it ?
[38:34] fe008 | OK .
[38:34] me011 | Yeah .
[38:35] fe008 | I mean
[38:36] me022 | Are you certain ?
[38:36] me025 | Lea ?
[38:37] me011 | No .
[38:38] fe008 | The claim that
[38:39] fe008 | uh words that get stressed
[38:40] fe008 | are easier to recognize .
[38:41] me025 | I see .
"[38:42] fe008 | So ,"
[38:43] me025 | Yeah .
[38:43] fe008 | I think it c there 's be sort of a benefit with very minimal input .
"[38:46] fe008 | Cuz when you listen to a sentence ,"
"[38:48] fe008 | If it 's contrastive stress you say "" Oh ! that word was stressed """
"[38:54] fe008 | so , I mean ,"
[38:56] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[38:57] fe008 | it 's just it 's there .
[38:57] me025 | OK . If you think it won't slow you down at all .
[38:58] fe008 | It 's not it doesn't take any thinking .
[38:59] me025 | Yeah .
"[38:59] fe008 | I 'm not going to talk about , you know"
[39:04] fe008 | if th if there 's a
"[39:05] fe008 | prominent word , to indicate it ."
[39:06] me011 | Sure .
"[39:07] me025 | Yeah , that 's great ."
[39:08] me011 | All caps .
"[39:09] me025 | No , well , presumably there 's a"
[39:09] fe008 | Whatever .
[39:10] fe008 | Whatever .
[39:11] me025 | an annotation standard for prefix characters or something like that . That 's what they 're using here .
"[39:15] fe008 | different ways , a and so just as long as it 's systematic in my view ,"
[39:16] me025 | OK .
[39:18] fe008 | you can always
"[39:18] me025 | Yeah , exactly ."
[39:19] fe008 | filter it into
[39:20] me025 | Exactly .
[39:21] me025 | Exactly .
[39:26] me011 | Anything else ?
"[39:28] me025 | Well , so , um"
"[39:32] me025 | I mean ,"
"[39:33] me011 | I 'm gonna go download "" Transcriber "" and Jane and I will look at it"
[39:34] me025 | How many meetings ? What about r
[39:36] me025 | our recording schedule ?
[39:37] me011 | Oh
[39:38] me025 | How many meetings are we going to record ?
[39:40] me025 | Um .
[39:41] me025 | Which ones are we going to transcribe ?
[39:44] me025 | Um .
[39:46] me011 | Well I think the answer is we need to record
[39:48] me011 | as many as we can .
[39:50] me025 | OK .
[39:50] me011 | Right ? I don't see any reason not to try to record
[39:53] me011 | a meeting or two a week .
[39:55] me025 | Absolutely .
[39:55] me011 | Um .
"[39:56] me011 | I mean , more if we can ."
[39:58] me011 | And uh
[40:01] me011 | um
[40:01] me011 | I wanna start by in the next couple weeks just doing
[40:04] me011 | the Speech group
[40:05] me011 | until we get to the point where we 're fairly comfortable with the hardware and the software and everything works .
[40:05] me025 | Yeah .
[40:10] me011 | and then I think I 'll also uh a Jerry volunteered to have his group do a few .
"[40:14] me011 | So , I 'll uh"
[40:15] me011 | try to get those as well .
"[40:18] fe008 | How many of these do you have ,"
[40:18] me025 | OK .
[40:19] fe008 | these near mikes ?
[40:20] me025 | Five .
[40:21] me011 | We have five of the wireless .
"[40:21] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
[40:23] fe008 | OK .
[40:23] me011 | And then we
[40:24] me011 | going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well .
[40:27] me011 | I mean notice that
[40:28] me011 | n
[40:28] me025 | Well .
[40:28] me011 | your you you stood up and walked around . None of the rest of us have .
[40:31] me011 | And so we could have wired mikes and I wouldn't be a big deal .
[40:31] fe008 | Oh .
"[40:34] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[40:34] me011 | for bigger meetings .
[40:35] fe008 | OK .
[40:36] fe008 | I see .
[40:37] me011 | So .
[40:37] fe008 | Interesting .
[40:38] fe008 | Very interesting .
"[40:40] fe008 | Wow ,"
"[40:40] fe008 | I 'm just really impressed by this , um ,"
[40:42] fe008 | yeah .
[40:43] me011 | It really makes you feel like you 're doing real work
[40:44] me011 | when you get all this hardware .
"[40:46] fe008 | Well , this is , I mean , compared to the way people"
[40:53] me025 | Uh - huh .
"[40:55] fe008 | and they do have DAT recorders ,"
[40:57] me025 | Mm - hmm .
[40:57] fe008 | but I mean this is just
"[40:58] fe008 | wonderful , the uh"
[40:59] fe008 | added level of
"[41:01] fe008 | yeah , compactness in the"
"[41:03] me025 | If we can do anything with it , yeah ."
[41:03] fe008 | channels .
[41:04] me011 | Yep .
[41:04] fe008 | I do find myself whispering .
[41:07] fe008 | My normal s .
[41:07] fe008 | I don't know why .
"[41:09] me011 | I had noticed that you were talking quietly , and I was actually going to ask you ."
[41:09] fe008 | It 's bizarre .
[41:11] me011 | I was going to ask you to speak up .
[41:12] fe008 | pattern .
[41:13] me011 | But I didn't want you to feel self - conscious .
[41:15] fe008 | I think the problem is that I 'm afraid that I 'm talking into someone 's ear .
[41:18] me011 | Oh .
[41:20] fe008 | And I realize now that you have volume
[41:23] fe008 | uh
[41:23] fe008 | control . But uh
[41:25] fe008 | Yeah .
[41:26] me025 | I don't feel like you 're
[41:27] me025 | speaking
[41:28] me025 | unnaturally quietly .
[41:28] fe008 | Oh good .
[41:29] me025 | I mean I feel like it 's all
[41:29] fe008 | OK . Good .
[41:31] me025 | quite normal .
"[41:31] me022 | Well , I hear what you 're saying ."
[41:32] me025 | Yeah .
[41:34] fe008 | Good .
[41:35] me025 | Eric 's really got it
"[41:36] me025 | easy cuz he 's got the lapel mike , which is so unobtrusive ."
[41:39] fe008 | That 's great .
[41:39] me022 | I asked if somebody else wanted the lapel mike .
[41:41] me022 | Somebody else can take it next time .
"[41:41] me011 | I 've been trying to rotate it through . So , Dan will get it next time ."
[41:44] fe008 | Are these more expensive or less expensive than this kind ?
[41:46] me025 | They 're much more expensive .
[41:47] fe008 | OK .
[41:48] me025 | Which I don't understand
[41:49] me025 | but there it is .
[41:49] fe008 | It would be like the television .
"[41:50] fe008 | effect or something , maybe ."
"[41:52] me025 | Right , it 's because"
[41:52] me025 | they make people feel like television stars .
[41:55] me011 | Do you feel like a television star ?
[41:55] me025 | So you can charge more for it .
[41:56] fe008 | That 's probably why I thought he was the chairman .
"[41:58] me025 | Yeah , that 's it ."
[41:59] me025 | That must be it .
"[41:59] me011 | That that makes sense , right ?"
[42:00] me022 | That 's it !
[42:00] me025 | Yeah .
[42:03] me022 | Right .
"[42:04] me011 | N You should have run it under your sweater , though ."
[42:06] me022 | Right .
[42:07] me022 | Yes .
"[42:10] me025 | OK . Well , I don't mind ."
"[42:11] me025 | Oh , we should read some more numbers , then ."
[42:13] me025 | Are we are we are we there ?
[42:13] fe008 | Oh good .
[42:14] me022 | Yeah .
[42:14] me025 | Are we at that point ?
[42:14] me011 | I think we 're there .
[42:14] fe008 | Good .
[42:16] me022 | How much space do we have left ?
[42:17] fe008 | Good .
[42:18] me025 | More space than you can We 've got two hours of space now .
[42:18] me011 | uh tons .
[42:20] me011 | He he he changed the downsampling .
[42:20] me022 | Oh really .
[42:21] me025 | Yeah .
"[42:23] me011 | OK , so this is Adam , on uh"
[42:23] me022 | Oh !
"[42:25] me011 | mike number two , wireless headset"
[42:27] me025 | In theory . Assuming it 's recording anything .
"[43:07] me022 | OK , this is Eric on"
"[43:09] me022 | microphone number one , uh channel zero"
"[44:00] fe008 | Here , here !"
"[44:48] fe008 | OK , this is Jane ."
[44:56] fe008 | OK .

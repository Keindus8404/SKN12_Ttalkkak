[00:00] me013 | Yeah .
"[00:00] me011 | OK , we 're on ."
"[00:01] me011 | So , I think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were"
[00:07] me011 | requested by Jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .
[00:11] me011 | So .
[00:13] me011 | The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ?
[00:21] mn014 | Is that English ?
[00:22] me018 | Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they
[00:27] me018 | finally made the tape for
[00:29] me018 | the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll
[00:35] me018 | have the transcription back from that .
[00:37] me011 | C can I have a pen ?
[00:39] me018 | Jane seems to be um
[00:41] me018 | moving right along on the
"[00:43] me018 | transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think"
[00:47] me018 | probably
[00:49] me018 | five or six
"[00:50] mn014 | Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something ."
[00:50] me018 | m more meetings .
[00:52] mn017 | Mmm .
[00:56] me001 | Which meetings is she transcribing ?
"[00:58] me018 | Um well we 've we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of"
[01:00] me001 | OK .
[01:03] me018 | awaiting
[01:04] me018 | to go to IBM .
"[01:05] mn014 | For IBM , yeah ."
[01:05] me001 | OK .
[01:05] mn017 | Hmm .
[01:06] me018 | and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here .
[01:08] me001 | So we 're doing some in parallel .
[01:09] mn017 | So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from
[01:11] me011 | Yep .
[01:12] me018 | No .
[01:14] me018 | Oh no no . No . We 're not waiting on them .
[01:14] mn017 | IBM no ?
"[01:15] me011 | No , no . We haven't done that process . So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process ."
[01:16] mn017 | Oh .
"[01:19] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
[01:19] me018 | Yeah .
"[01:21] me018 | We 're doing it in parallel , yeah ."
[01:22] me001 | OK .
"[01:25] mn017 | um , s some of her people to"
"[01:28] mn017 | transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions ."
[01:36] mn014 | Yep .
"[01:40] mn017 | The Again , we we have a similar uh"
[01:43] mn017 | logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich and get it transcribed and get it back .
[01:46] me011 | Right .
[01:48] mn017 | But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .
[01:53] mn017 | And so um I wanted to ask Jane if if
"[01:57] mn017 | uh , you know , maybe one of their"
"[01:59] mn017 | transcribers could could do I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh ,"
[02:03] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:05] mn014 | There 's only two channels .
[02:07] mn014 | So it 's only Yeah . As the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed I think . So .
"[02:09] mn017 | Right , s"
[02:10] mn017 | Yeah . So So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's One session is only
"[02:16] me013 | So that should have ma many fewer And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , right ? So . Yeah ."
"[02:29] mn017 | And so um ,"
[02:30] mn014 | Yep .
"[02:37] mn017 | Uh if if that 's OK with you to to , you know ,"
[02:40] me013 | Yeah .
"[02:40] mn017 | get that stuff uh to ask her for that , then I 'll do that ."
[02:48] mn017 | Yeah .
"[02:51] mn017 | OK , yeah ."
[02:54] me013 | Yeah .
[02:54] mn017 | Alrighty .
[03:09] me011 | Can you mail that out to the list ?
"[03:14] me011 | Oh , OK , OK ."
[03:16] me018 | I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .
"[03:18] me011 | Yeah , I haven't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory . I 'll try to get to that ."
[03:21] me018 | Yeah .
"[03:38] me011 | I 'm gonna send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to"
[03:50] me013 | OK .
[03:50] me011 | For the ones that we have .
"[03:53] mn014 | So but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ?"
"[03:55] me011 | Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also ."
"[03:56] mn014 | OK , yeah , yep . Ah ."
[04:00] me011 | I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right . So you want people to be able to listen to them .
[04:01] mn014 | Yeah .
[04:04] mn014 | Yeah .
"[04:12] me011 | Oh , that 's a good point ."
"[04:14] me011 | That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression ."
[04:22] me018 | Hmm .
"[04:24] me018 | Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on"
"[04:28] me011 | Well , that was the other point . Yep , that 's another agenda item ."
"[04:30] me018 | Oh , was that another one ? OK . I 'll wait ."
"[04:35] me011 | But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too ."
"[04:37] me011 | Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID ."
[04:52] me011 | So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well .
"[04:56] me011 | The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer ."
[05:11] me001 | Right .
[05:14] me013 | Oh -
"[05:19] me011 | As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something ."
[05:27] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[05:29] me013 | O K . Finally said he was too busy . I guess we reached it .
"[05:39] me001 | And , also um ,"
"[05:41] me001 | I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves"
"[05:44] me001 | kind of display , and I don't know how much more we can do with it with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I don't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it think it has potential for"
"[05:50] me011 | Oh , cool ."
"[05:59] me011 | For a demo ? Yeah , sounds good ."
"[05:59] me001 | a little something , yeah , for a demo ."
[06:10] me001 | Oh . OK .
[06:12] me011 | So it might just be slides .
[06:14] mn014 | Well Yeah .
[06:17] mn014 | I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work .
[06:31] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:32] mn014 | Yep .
[06:35] me011 | Well
"[06:37] me011 | Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack , so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work ."
[06:39] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:40] mn017 | Right .
[06:41] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:43] mn014 | Yeah but But the problem is
"[06:44] mn014 | the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to to the author of to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library and so it works ."
[06:59] me011 | Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ?
"[07:02] mn014 | Yeah , but then you can't add our patches and then"
"[07:06] mn014 | the the new version is is totally different a and in yeah , in terms of of the source code . You you can't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing and you can't you can't access that so"
[07:06] me011 | Oh .
[07:11] me011 | Ah .
[07:14] mn017 | Mmm .
[07:17] mn014 | you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then
[07:23] mn014 | do the patches . Yeah .
[07:24] me011 | Patch . Ugh !
[07:24] mn017 | I I wonder if if we should
[07:26] mn017 | contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along We have ? Oh .
[07:29] mn014 | Yeah .
[07:31] me011 | We have Yeah b it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .
"[07:34] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
[07:35] me018 | So did you um
"[07:41] mn014 | No , I haven't done that yet . I 'm oh Nope ."
[07:44] mn014 | But I definitely will do that .
"[07:46] me013 | So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this"
[07:54] me001 | Yeah .
"[07:55] me001 | Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different It 's a waveform and"
[08:05] me001 | I mean we could do it in Matl - I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure .
"[08:09] mn017 | But But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary"
[08:11] mn014 | Yep .
[08:15] me001 | Yeah .
[08:17] mn017 | valued function that is that is you know time synchron ti
"[08:19] me001 | Yeah , that 'd be very cool ."
[08:19] me013 | Yes .
"[08:20] me011 | It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's it 's It 's more Tcl - T K programming . So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , but uh , it wouldn't be hard to do ."
[08:22] mn017 | ti time synchronous with the wavform .
[08:24] me001 | Yeah .
[08:25] mn017 | Right .
[08:27] mn017 | Right .
[08:30] mn017 | But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed . S Right .
[08:32] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[08:32] me011 | Yep .
[08:33] mn014 | Yep .
"[08:35] mn014 | Yeah . Yeah , maybe we could l look into that ."
[08:38] me001 | Yeah .
[08:38] me011 | But it it seems to me that
[08:40] me011 | I c
[08:41] me011 | It doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images .
[08:50] me018 | Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .
[08:52] me001 | OK .
[08:54] me018 | Is that what you mean ? Yeah .
"[08:54] me011 | Yeah , jus Yeah . It just seems to me jus"
[08:59] mn014 | And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah .
"[08:59] me001 | to hear it and see it , and see the pitch contours also ."
[09:02] mn014 | Yeah .
"[09:02] me011 | Sure , but I don't think I You can do all that just statically in PowerPoint."
"[09:07] me001 | Yeah , I mean y"
"[09:08] me001 | Right , right ."
[09:14] me001 | um view graphs or something .
"[09:16] me013 | You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have"
[09:19] me001 | Right .
[09:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:48] me013 | um Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh ,"
[09:53] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[09:53] me013 | in to people .
"[09:56] me013 | Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics"
[10:04] me013 | It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and
[10:05] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[10:06] mn017 | Mmm .
[10:07] me013 | see them .
"[10:12] me011 | And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk ."
"[10:22] me011 | So , uh ,"
"[10:24] me011 | we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings ."
[10:32] mn014 | Yeah .
"[10:33] me011 | And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data"
[10:44] mn014 | Yeah .
"[10:44] me018 | Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too ."
"[10:46] me011 | Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh ,"
[10:46] mn014 | Yeah .
[10:48] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[10:50] mn014 | An -
[10:53] me018 | Right .
"[10:55] me011 | uh , the permission forms , so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around ."
"[11:02] me011 | And Jane was gonna talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we we just got these hundred alright , excuse me ten , uh"
[11:10] me011 | SPARC - Blade
[11:12] me013 | Did they come in ?
[11:13] me018 | SUN - Blades . Yeah . They came in the other day .
[11:14] me011 | SUN - Blades . They came in but they 're not set up yet . And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those
[11:14] mn017 | Yeah .
[11:15] me013 | Oh .
[11:31] me013 | Yeah .
[11:31] me011 | Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott .
[11:33] me018 | Ah .
"[11:34] me018 | Ah , I see ."
"[11:35] me013 | Weren't we gonna get Well , maybe it should get another rack ."
[11:36] mn017 | But you still need to store the disks somehow .
"[11:39] me011 | Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays ."
[11:43] me011 | Just put them in .
[11:46] mn014 | Internal . Yeah .
[11:46] me011 | Sure .
[11:47] me011 | Yeah .
[11:49] mn017 | Oh .
"[11:49] me011 | Cuz the SUN uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives . So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in ."
[11:54] mn017 | Mmm .
"[11:56] me013 | But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something ."
"[12:09] me011 | Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ?"
[12:14] mn014 | Yep .
"[12:15] mn017 | I see Oh , I see ."
"[12:16] me013 | Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , mightn't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,"
"[12:22] me011 | Oh , I didn't know he had left already ."
"[12:23] me013 | Uh , well , tonight ."
"[12:25] me011 | Oh , oh well ."
[12:26] mn017 | You mean he won't set up the mmm .
[12:28] me001 | How much space do you need for these ?
[12:29] me013 | I don't know . I don't know what his schedule is . I 'm just saying he 's gone .
[12:30] me011 | You we need about a gig per meeting .
[12:31] me018 | I I thi
[12:32] me001 | I have um I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .
[12:36] me011 | Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ?
"[12:38] me001 | Uh , Samosa ."
"[12:41] me001 | Yeah , I had . Well it 's about I think there 's about twelve gig left ."
[12:45] me011 | So it And you have an X drives installed ? OK .
[12:47] me001 | Yeah .
"[12:48] me001 | So , I didn't realize it was so critical . I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in I really can't do anything ."
[12:49] me011 | And you 're o you 're offering ?
[12:57] me011 | OK .
"[12:57] me018 | I I jus I just gave Thilo some about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh Abbott ."
"[12:57] me001 | Um not that I can't do anything , I jus"
"[13:09] me011 | Which one was that , X G ? OK ."
[13:10] mn014 | XG .
[13:10] me018 | XG .
[13:13] me018 | Yeah .
[13:13] mn017 | XG ?
"[13:18] mn017 | The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , right ?"
[13:20] me018 | No . I don't think that 's on XG . On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk .
"[13:21] me011 | But that won't be getting any bigger , will it ?"
[13:22] mn017 | Right .
[13:24] mn014 | It 's Yeah .
[13:24] mn017 | But I 've also been storing I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are and we won't be using the old ones anymore .
"[13:34] me018 | Yeah , I do I don't think it was on XG . I th"
"[13:34] me001 | I have a lot of space , though ."
[13:35] mn014 | Isn't that XH ?
[13:36] me001 | I have a lot of space and it 's not it 's n There 's very little uh Yeah not for long . But I mean it 's not going f It 's not being used often at all .
[13:40] mn017 | Maybe I 'm confu Oh no I 'm sorry .
[13:44] mn017 | Oh OK .
[13:48] me001 | I th
[13:49] mn017 | I think you 're right . It 's XH and D The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . OK .
"[13:49] me001 | I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , three or four meetings ."
[13:55] me011 | Great .
[13:55] me001 | So .
[14:04] mn017 | OK .
[14:05] me013 | There should I d There should just be a b I should have a button .
"[14:08] me013 | Just press Press each meeting saying "" we need more disk space "" "" this week "" . Skip the rest of the conversation ."
"[14:09] me011 | The "" more disk space "" button ? Yep ."
[14:16] me018 | Well we 've collected so far something like
[14:18] me018 | uh sixty - five meetings .
[14:21] me018 | And it 's
[14:21] me013 | And And how much does each meeting take ?
[14:23] me018 | about a gig uncompressed .
[14:26] mn014 | It 's It 's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompress the all of the PZM and the PDA things . So .
[14:27] me018 | Is a little more ?
[14:34] mn014 | Yeah .
[14:34] mn014 | One point five or something .
[14:37] me011 | Half a gig . For all of them .
[14:37] me018 | About half ?
[14:38] mn014 | Yeah .
[14:39] mn014 | Yeah . Yep .
[14:41] me018 | So we 're definitely are storing
"[14:43] me018 | you know , all of those ."
[14:45] me018 | So there 's what thirty some gig
[14:48] me018 | of just meetings so far ?
[14:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:57] mn014 | Yeah .
[15:00] me011 | I would like to .
"[15:03] me013 | Yeah . Well I mean it 's the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , but"
[15:10] me011 | Yep .
"[15:11] me013 | But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars ."
"[15:19] me018 | Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for if we could get some disk . I s I sent this out"
[15:22] me013 | Yeah .
[15:25] me013 | Right .
[15:26] me018 | a a day ago but and Dave didn't respond so I don I don't know
[15:34] me011 | Yep .
[15:35] me018 | So I was assuming he was gonna take over that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .
"[15:39] me013 | Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was "" are you sure you just want one ? "" So I mean I think"
[15:48] me018 | Yeah .
[15:55] me011 | Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .
[16:01] me013 | Yeah .
[16:07] me013 | Right .
[16:08] me011 | So the question is where are you gonna hang them ?
[16:11] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[16:12] me018 | I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .
[16:14] me011 | Right .
[16:15] me018 | So .
[16:20] me018 | I think part of the reason why Dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now . So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff .
[16:23] mn017 | Mmm .
[16:25] me011 | Yep .
[16:25] mn017 | One One
[16:27] mn017 | On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is
"[16:32] mn017 | I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh ,"
[16:36] mn017 | around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space .
[16:41] me011 | Yep .
"[16:42] me013 | Yeah . No . I think Dave Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time ."
[16:44] mn017 | Right .
[16:50] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[16:50] me011 | But I I know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh
[16:57] mn017 | Mmm .
[16:58] me011 | the back the
[17:02] mn017 | Mmm .
"[17:05] me013 | Well . So . But this this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get"
[17:19] mn017 | Maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there .
[17:25] me011 | Popcorn .
[17:26] me013 | Yeah ?
[17:31] me018 | Hmm .
[17:33] mn017 | What do you mean it 's not on the net ?
[17:35] mn014 | It 's not bad .
"[17:38] mn017 | Oh because it 's because it 's an ACIRI machine ? Oh , oh oh ."
[17:41] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:42] me011 | And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but"
[17:46] me011 | Who knows when that will happen ?
[17:47] me018 | That might be a good
"[17:49] me018 | short term solution , though ."
"[17:50] me011 | No , the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire"
"[17:58] me011 | So , they actually have to run a wire"
[18:01] me011 | somewhere .
[18:01] me013 | Yeah .
[18:10] me011 | But Dave has to do all of them .
"[18:23] me013 | Uh , maybe maybe after after tea or something you and I can go down and and talk to him about it Just say "" wha you know , what should we do right now ? """
[18:32] me018 | How long is David gonna be gone ?
"[18:34] me013 | Uh , eleven days or something ?"
[18:40] me013 | Yeah basically tomorrow and all of the week after .
[18:46] me011 | And that 's all I have .
"[18:53] me013 | uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we"
[18:58] me013 | had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here
[19:06] me013 | the Friday after next .
"[19:08] me013 | And I I I wanted to make it , um"
"[19:11] me013 | after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wanna"
[19:16] me013 | do next meeting is is uh to
"[19:19] me013 | put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it ,"
"[19:25] me013 | um ,"
[19:26] me013 | that
[19:27] me013 | we 've done .
[19:30] me013 | bulletize I mean o e do do I can I can dream up text but this is basically gonna lead to the annual report .
[19:36] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[19:38] me011 | This is the fifteenth ?
"[19:41] me013 | Um , that would"
[19:41] me011 | So just a week from tomorrow ? OK .
[19:43] me013 | Yeah .
[19:44] me013 | Yeah .
[19:46] mn017 | Is this gotta be in the morning ?
[19:49] mn017 | Or Because you know I Fridays I have to leave uh
[19:53] mn017 | like around uh two .
[19:56] mn017 | So if it could be before that would be be
[20:03] me013 | Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting
[20:05] mn017 | OK .
[20:06] mn017 | Alright .
[20:09] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[20:13] mn017 | OK .
"[20:17] me013 | Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll"
[20:20] me013 | be having that that discussion with her .
[20:21] mn017 | Mmm .
[20:23] me013 | Um .
[20:26] me013 | So .
[20:36] mn017 | also a you know various variously talked about the um work that
[20:42] mn017 | w uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side um but isn't necessarily
[20:46] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[20:48] mn017 | related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And
[20:53] mn017 | I wondered whether we should
[20:56] mn017 | maybe have um a separate meeting and between
"[21:01] mn017 | you know , whoever 's interested in that"
[21:03] mn017 | because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of
[21:08] mn017 | um
[21:12] me013 | Think so ?
[21:16] mn017 | It 's just
[21:18] mn017 | gonna be ver very boring for people who are not
"[21:20] mn017 | you know , sort of"
[21:22] mn017 | really interested in the details of the
[21:24] me011 | I 'm interested .
[21:24] mn017 | recognition system .
[21:26] mn014 | Me too .
"[21:26] me013 | Well , OK , so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition ?"
[21:33] me018 | Jane may not be .
"[21:33] me011 | Jane , I think ."
[21:35] mn014 | Yep .
[21:39] me011 | No . If we talked about it in this meeting .
[21:40] me018 | He 's wondering how much overlap there will be .
[21:41] mn017 | OK .
"[21:41] me013 | Yeah , so you 're su So ."
"[21:43] mn017 | So , uh ,"
"[21:44] mn017 | uh , Liz and Jane probably ."
"[21:47] me013 | OK , so we 're gonna have a guy 's meeting ."
[21:54] me001 | Watch a ball game ?
"[21:56] me013 | Yeah , real real real men"
"[21:56] me018 | Don't listen to this , Liz ."
"[21:59] me013 | "" Real men do decoding "" or something like that ."
[22:01] mn017 | Right .
[22:02] me013 | Uh .
[22:04] me013 | Yeah .
[22:04] mn017 | I mean when when the talk is about data collection
[22:16] me013 | So you need a better developed feminine side .
"[22:25] me011 | Yeah , I would as I would guess ."
[22:29] me013 | Uh .
[22:31] me013 | Um .
[22:40] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:42] me013 | You know , I I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be . I mean the Um ."
[22:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[22:49] me018 | Why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?
[22:54] me011 | Or just alternate the focus .
[22:55] me018 | Tha - That 's what I mean .
"[22:56] me011 | Yeah , so on even weeks have basic on data ."
[22:56] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:58] mn017 | We could do that , yeah ."
[22:58] me018 | Yeah .
[22:59] mn017 | I I Personally I 'd I 'm not in favor of more meetings .
[23:03] me013 | Right .
"[23:04] mn017 | Because , uh . You know ."
[23:11] mn017 | Right .
[23:14] mn014 | Yep .
"[23:14] me018 | Well , cuz we get into these other topics ."
[23:15] me001 | Yeah .
[23:15] mn017 | We feel We feel obligated to collect more data .
[23:15] me011 | Yeah .
[23:17] me018 | Yeah .
[23:18] me011 | Ugh .
[23:19] me011 | I don't . Let 's read digits and go .
"[23:21] me013 | Why don't we just start with that . And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . But I I think that 's a great idea ."
[23:24] mn017 | ummh . OK .
[23:27] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[23:31] me013 | Uh .
[23:33] me013 | So uh .
[23:35] me013 | Um .
[23:38] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[23:40] me018 | Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have
[23:42] me018 | various talks in the halls and there 's lots of
[23:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:53] me018 | So , it would be good ."
"[23:55] me013 | Yeah , and you 're you 're attending"
"[24:01] me013 | probably one of the best you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . We are doing recognition in both of them . So ."
[24:05] me011 | Bridge .
[24:05] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[24:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:09] mn017 | Right .
[24:10] me013 | Uh .
[24:12] mn017 | So um .
[24:12] me011 | OK ?
[24:13] mn017 | So so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there 's some time .
[24:20] mn017 | Um I jus So the latest result was that um
[24:24] mn017 | um
[24:25] mn017 | yot
[24:26] mn017 | I tested the uh the
[24:29] mn017 | sort of final version of the PLP
[24:32] mn017 | configuration
[24:33] mn017 | um on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set .
[24:38] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[24:39] mn017 | And the
[24:41] mn017 | recognition performance was
"[24:44] mn017 | exactly , and I mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the"
[24:49] mn017 | uh Mel Cepstra
[24:50] mn017 | front - end .
[24:50] me011 | Mmm .
[24:51] me018 | For both females and males ?
[24:52] mn017 | Yes .
[24:53] me018 | Oh !
[24:58] mn017 | i overall .
[24:58] mn017 | They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . I mean definitely not significant .
[24:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[25:04] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[25:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[25:05] mn017 | And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .
[25:11] me011 | Wow .
[25:12] me011 | Just with ROVER ?
"[25:14] mn017 | t With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER ."
[25:18] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[25:24] me013 | So except I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the
[25:30] me013 | auto - regressive versus the
[25:31] mn017 | Yeah .
[25:32] me013 | cepstral truncation . OK .
"[25:36] me011 | Yeah , it 's pretty impressive ."
"[25:36] mn017 | And And so uh after I told the my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know ,"
"[25:43] mn017 | now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination ."
"[25:51] mn017 | Um , and , you know , why not ? Uh . So ."
"[25:54] me013 | Sure , why not ?"
"[25:55] me011 | We clearly gotta add a few more features , though ."
[25:59] mn017 | Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?
"[26:04] me011 | No , uh front - end features ."
"[26:10] mn017 | Oh I mean Yeah . Well Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's the the"
"[26:15] mn017 | the There 's one thing uh I mean you don't want to overdo it because y every front - end You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different"
[26:20] me018 | Oh .
[26:25] mn017 | systems and Um . So .
[26:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[26:28] mn017 | So one one
[26:32] mn017 | only
[26:33] mn017 | to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then
[26:39] mn017 | after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing . So .
[26:44] me013 | Mmm .
[26:47] me013 | An -
"[26:50] mn017 | I I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing ."
[26:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:59] mn017 | So .
"[27:01] mn017 | Um Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely ."
[27:04] me011 | Cool .
"[27:07] mn017 | And then we had some results on digits , uh ,"
[27:12] mn017 | with um We We So this was uh
[27:16] mn017 | really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um
"[27:21] mn017 | experiments . And so ,"
[27:21] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:23] mn017 | uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the"
[27:28] mn017 | Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . And you c
[27:30] me013 | Right .
[27:33] me011 | Right .
"[27:34] me013 | Including digits I gather , yeah ."
"[27:35] mn017 | And Not all of No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that ."
[27:40] me013 | A fifth of it is how much ?
[27:46] me013 | Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ?
[27:52] mn017 | A fifth would be maybe
[27:57] mn017 | uh two hours something .
"[27:59] me013 | Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was . So ."
[28:01] mn017 | Right .
[28:05] me013 | Oh yeah w
"[28:07] mn017 | You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits , which is only what two hours something ?"
[28:12] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[28:14] me013 | Right .
[28:14] me011 | I don't know .
[28:15] mn017 | So .
"[28:16] mn017 | Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty . That 's e That was e Right , right ."
"[28:23] me013 | Yeah that was the interesting thing . Because because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , but but uh ."
[28:29] mn017 | Right .
[28:29] me018 | Well is there even more read speech data around ?
"[28:31] mn017 | Oh , yeah . So we only for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database ."
[28:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:38] mn017 | Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better ."
[28:42] me011 | I could also put in uh
[28:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:45] me011 | focus condition zero from Hub - four
"[28:47] me011 | from Broadcast News ,"
[28:49] me011 | which is mostly prepared speech .
[28:51] me011 | It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .
[28:51] mn017 | Yeah .
[28:53] mn017 | Yeah .
[28:54] mn017 | Right .
"[28:55] mn017 | Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal , uh , take one example ."
[28:58] me011 | Yeah .
[28:58] me011 | That 's right .
[29:00] mn017 | But um .
"[29:02] mn017 | So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits ."
[29:07] me011 | Yeah .
[29:10] me013 | Well they been using TIMIT .
[29:12] mn017 | OK .
[29:12] me013 | That Uh .
[29:19] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:22] me013 | um , and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT ."
[29:27] me011 | Hmm .
"[29:28] me013 | But uh which So that 's what they 're they 're using now . But but yeah certainly if we ,"
[29:30] mn017 | Mmm .
[29:35] me013 | If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . So we don't know exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .
[29:39] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[29:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:47] me013 | Once we know , then the trainable parts of it it 'd be great to run"
[29:51] me013 | lots of lots of stuff through .
[29:52] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[29:53] mn017 | Right .
"[29:55] mn017 | Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem"
[30:03] mn017 | You wanna You wanna see where that stands ? @ @
"[30:04] me018 | Well , I 'm Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um"
[30:15] me018 | converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train
[30:19] me018 | uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And .
[30:24] mn017 | An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight forty - eight phones ?
[30:28] me018 | Right .
[30:33] me018 | Eight .
[30:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[30:35] mn017 | Uh which is smaller than the um
[30:38] mn017 | than the phone set that that we 've been using so far .
"[30:42] mn017 | And that that that will probably help , actually , because"
[30:42] me018 | So it 's a little different ?
"[30:45] mn017 | um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um ,"
"[30:54] mn017 | Just You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know ,"
[31:02] mn017 | fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .
"[31:07] me013 | Sure . Although we I mean , it 's not that many fewer and and and we take a KLT anyway so we could Yeah ."
[31:10] mn017 | Right .
[31:11] mn017 | Exactly . So so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe
[31:17] mn017 | uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um
[31:22] mn017 | front - end . So
[31:23] mn017 | that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT
"[31:28] me013 | Yeah , and I think and we sh again check we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much ."
[31:29] mn017 | dimensions .
[31:36] mn017 | Right .
[31:37] me018 | By just taking the top whatever ?
[31:38] me011 | Yep .
[31:39] me013 | Yeah yeah .
"[31:40] mn017 | But then And then something Once we have the new M L P trained up ,"
[31:45] mn017 | uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on
"[31:54] mn017 | you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the"
"[32:00] mn017 | you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system ."
[32:03] me013 | And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system .
[32:06] mn017 | Exactly .
[32:06] me018 | Right .
[32:07] mn017 | Yeah . So
"[32:09] mn017 | that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a"
[32:14] mn017 | better system
"[32:15] mn017 | um because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then"
[32:25] me013 | Yeah .
[32:29] mn017 | he probably didn't use all the training data
[32:31] mn017 | that was available . And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um
[32:39] mn017 | as ours is . So .
"[32:40] me013 | That 's That 's certainly one thing , yeah . Uh ."
[32:42] mn017 | And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We we made some
[32:44] me013 | Yeah .
[32:51] mn017 | uh something like a four percent absolute
"[32:57] me013 | Well the other thing is , dipping"
[33:01] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:03] me013 | when we were collaborating with SRI before , uh"
[33:04] mn017 | Mmm . Mm - hmm .
"[33:06] me013 | it was I think , it is was a really key"
"[33:09] me013 | uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher ,"
[33:15] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[33:16] me013 | uh at the time . Uh .
[33:16] mn017 | Yeah .
[33:18] me018 | Yeah .
[33:23] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[33:24] me013 | then it was it was typically better to use our own systems cuz they were self consistent but but certainly to start off when we were
[33:30] me013 | trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . But that was a that was a good good good way to start .
[33:35] mn017 | Yeah .
[33:37] mn017 | OK .
[33:40] mn017 | Yeah .
[33:42] me018 | W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ?
[33:42] mn017 | Right .
[33:46] me018 | Roughly ?
"[33:47] me013 | Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent"
[33:58] me013 | fix up the dictionary .
[33:59] me013 | Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gonna do and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .
[34:03] mn017 | Yeah .
[34:04] mn017 | Mmm .
[34:08] mn017 | Right .
"[34:10] mn017 | And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ?"
[34:14] mn017 | Where the error rate now is in the twenties .
[34:16] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[34:16] mn017 | So , um ."
[34:17] me013 | So we were Yeah . We were
[34:17] mn017 | That 's yet s
[34:18] me013 | probably at least a factor or two off .
[34:19] mn017 | Right .
[34:20] me013 | Yeah .
[34:20] mn017 | So it would be So it would be good t to sort of r re uh just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .
[34:22] me013 | Yeah .
[34:26] me013 | Yeah .
[34:28] me013 | Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s
[34:29] me013 | conversational speech bit .
[34:30] me013 | Because our our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . He knows .
[34:30] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[34:33] mn017 | Right .
[34:34] mn017 | And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ?
[34:40] mn017 | Because it 's a pretty good um
[34:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[34:43] mn017 | indicator of that .
"[34:50] mn017 | uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system ."
[34:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:54] me013 | Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's it 'd be context independent and so on . But ."
[34:56] mn017 | No .
[34:56] mn017 | Sure .
[34:57] me018 | Should we Should we bother with um using the net
[35:02] me018 | before doing uh embedded
[35:05] me018 | training ?
"[35:07] mn017 | Oh oh that 's a good question . Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um"
[35:14] mn017 | from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .
[35:19] me011 | Try it .
[35:21] me011 | You run it ? Keep keep both versions ? See which one 's better ?
"[35:24] me013 | Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad -"
[35:26] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[35:28] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[35:30] mn017 | Right .
[35:36] me018 | Mmm .
[35:36] mn017 | Alright .
"[35:37] me011 | I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's Sort of given up guessing ."
[35:38] mn017 | But But so I Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen
[35:43] mn017 | big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got
[35:49] me013 | Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important because we 're coming from
[35:51] mn017 | Right .
"[35:55] me013 | uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system ."
[35:57] mn017 | Right .
[35:58] mn017 | Right .
"[35:59] me011 | Although ,"
[35:59] me013 | Uh .
"[36:00] me011 | I mean we 've done it with When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse ."
[36:11] me013 | Right . But I mean i
[36:12] me011 | I think it 's a bug .
[36:13] mn017 | So you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ?
[36:18] me011 | Yep .
[36:20] mn017 | Uh . Hmm .
[36:22] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:22] mn017 | Well , that might probably just Hmm . That was probably because your initial system I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's ."
[36:32] mn017 | Um .
[36:32] me013 | Was it ? I don't think it was .
[36:34] me011 | No they were they were comparable .
[36:34] mn017 | It wasn't ?
[36:35] me013 | No .
[36:35] mn017 | Really ?
[36:36] me011 | They were very close .
[36:36] me013 | Yeah .
[36:37] mn017 | That 's weird .
[36:39] me013 | Excuse me ?
[36:40] mn017 | That 's That 's weird .
[36:41] mn017 | No I mean it 's weird that it did I 'm sorry . It 's w It 's weird that it got worse .
[36:41] me011 | That 's what I said .
[36:47] me018 | That 's ambiguous .
[36:49] me013 | Um . No . Uh .
[36:52] me013 | Tha - u we we 've see I mean and wi with the numbers OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .
[37:01] mn017 | We have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .
[37:07] mn017 | Yeah .
[37:08] me013 | But I But I would I would suspect that something that that had um a very different
[37:14] me013 | Um
"[37:15] me013 | feature set , for instance I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us ."
[37:19] me011 | Yep .
[37:22] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[37:24] me018 | What about uh hidden unit size on this . Oh .
[37:31] me013 | to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .
[37:35] me011 | Right .
"[37:35] me013 | So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference and"
[37:36] me011 | Ah yeah . That 's another big difference .
[37:40] mn017 | You mean with soft targets ?
"[37:45] mn017 | Sorry , I 'm sor I missed What What 's the key issue here ?"
"[37:48] me013 | Oh , that uh"
[37:51] me013 | both the Cambridge system and our system were were training
"[38:00] me013 | So so that 's another difference . I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end"
[38:00] mn017 | Yeah .
"[38:04] me013 | different different uh , um ,"
"[38:08] me013 | Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded uh"
[38:14] me013 | training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . But we don't know .
[38:16] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[38:20] mn017 | OK .
[38:21] me013 | You gonna say something ?
[38:21] me018 | Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what
[38:27] me018 | Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?
"[38:29] me013 | Uh , how much training data ?"
"[38:31] me018 | Well , I was gonna start off with the small train set ."
[38:34] me013 | And how How many hours is that ?
[38:35] me018 | That 's why I was I I 'm not sure how much that is .
"[38:39] mn017 | Well i you 'd would be gender - dependent training , right ? So So I think it 's uh that 's about"
"[38:41] me018 | Gender - dependent , yeah ."
"[38:47] mn017 | mmm , something like thirty hours ."
[38:49] me018 | Thirty hours .
[38:49] mn017 | Thirty hours per gender .
[38:53] me018 | In the small training set ?
[39:01] mn017 | like thirty forty hours something like that .
[39:05] me018 | They called to tell us that ?
[39:06] mn017 | Yeah .
[39:08] me013 | Um . So . Uh .
[39:10] me013 | after run
[39:12] me013 | Right . So At least a couple thousand hidden units .
[39:17] me013 | I mean . It 's it 's th the thing I 'll I 'll think about it a little more but it it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .
[39:23] me018 | Mmm .
[39:26] me018 | And a thousand is too small ?
"[39:29] me013 | Oh let me think about it , but I think that that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns ."
[39:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:34] me013 | I mean it doesn't actually get worse , typically , but it but but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling the amount of time ."
[39:34] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[39:42] me011 | But not by a lot .
[39:42] me013 | Not by much . Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ?
[39:44] me011 | Vast majority is from the input unit .
[39:47] mn017 | OK . Yeah .
[39:48] me013 | Yeah . Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect .
"[39:50] me011 | Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger ."
[39:52] me013 | Yeah .
"[39:54] mn017 | Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course . Yeah . It 's negligible , OK ."
[39:55] me013 | Yeah .
"[39:58] me013 | Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference ."
[40:00] mn017 | Uh - huh .
[40:01] me013 | Uh .
[40:08] me018 | The The net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up .
[40:18] me013 | of speech .
[40:18] mn017 | Was that gender - dependent or independent ?
[40:19] me018 | Gender - dependent .
[40:20] me013 | Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours .
[40:23] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[40:27] me013 | two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better
[40:30] me013 | and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good . So .
[40:31] me011 | It 'll be faster .
[40:33] me018 | Yeah .
[40:34] me018 | Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just
[40:34] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[40:35] me013 | Yeah .
[40:36] me018 | to see .
[40:38] mn017 | OK .
[40:38] me018 | OK .
"[40:39] me013 | Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and"
[40:43] me013 | ten thousand
[40:45] me013 | uh
[40:46] me013 | seconds .
"[40:48] me013 | Uh , so that 's like eleven eleven million frames ."
[40:52] me013 | And a two thousand hidden unit net
[40:56] me013 | is uh
[40:58] me013 | I guess about
"[41:00] me013 | seven , eight hundred thousand parameters ."
[41:11] mn017 | Right . I actually have to go . So .
[41:13] me013 | Alright .
[41:15] me013 | Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one .
[41:19] me013 | Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of yeah Uncle Bernie yeah .
[41:26] mn017 | Read your digits .
[41:29] me013 | Yes sir .
[41:29] me011 | We 're just waiting for you to leave .
[41:33] me013 | @ @
[41:34] me011 | Anything else ?
[41:35] me013 | Nah .
[41:36] me011 | OK .
[41:38] me011 | If yeah that 's right .
[41:39] mn014 | Yeah .
"[41:40] me011 | Uh , well , we started late ."

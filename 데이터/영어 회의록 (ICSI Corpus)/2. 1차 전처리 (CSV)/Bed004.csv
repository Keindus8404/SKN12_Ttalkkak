"[00:06] me003 | Hey , you 're not supposed to be drinking in here dude ."
[00:09] mn015 | OK .
[01:12] me003 | Do we have to read them that slowly ?
[01:15] me003 | OK . Sounded like a robot .
"[01:19] me003 | Um , this is t"
"[02:43] fe016 | Great . I 'm thinking , why don't you guys go ahead and start I mean , the data of the of you guys talking to each other is still useful . And then when your colleagues come in you know , it 'll it 's recording now , so it 'll just keep recording ."
"[02:55] fe016 | And then if Would you do me a big favor , um , maybe Robert , cuz you know how to do this , that 's just hitting the square ? the black square when you 're done ?"
"[03:03] fe016 | But make sure not to hit the "" record "" again . It will erase everything ."
"[03:06] fe016 | If you hit that black square , that 's great ."
[03:08] fe016 | I 'm gonna be in the meeting that might run over to four o ' clock @ @ finished .
"[03:13] fe016 | And then when you leave , just turn off the microphones , the batteries go up and down and That 's great ."
[03:22] fe016 | At least we got yours .
[03:24] fe016 | OK . Thanks . Have a good meeting .
[03:26] me012 | OK .
[03:46] me003 | That 's what I think of when I think of beat poetry .
[03:49] me012 | Beat poetry .
"[03:53] me003 | You ever seen "" So I married an axe murderer "" ?"
[03:56] me012 | Uh parts of it .
[03:56] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[03:58] me003 | There 's a part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .
[04:00] me012 | Oh yeah ?
[04:01] me003 | And he talks like that .
[04:04] me003 | That uh probably is why I think of it that way .
[04:07] mn015 | Hmm .
"[04:08] mn015 | No , I didn't see that movie . Who did who made that ?"
[04:10] me003 | Mike Meyers is the guy .
[04:11] mn015 | Oh . OK .
"[04:18] me003 | That 's his cute romantic comedy , yeah ."
"[04:30] me003 | The other thing that 's real funny ,"
"[04:37] me003 | and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso ,"
"[04:53] mn015 | Uh . We 're having , a"
[05:02] me003 | Wait do are y
[05:04] me003 | So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?
[05:11] mn015 | a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who
[05:16] me003 | Ah .
[05:27] mn015 | and then vote .
[05:28] me003 | Hmm .
[05:30] mn015 | Should be fun .
"[05:38] me003 | Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours ."
[05:46] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:48] mn015 | Well , I was thinking if um y you guys have plans for Sunday ? We 're we 're not it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but um we 're sort of working with the weather here"
[05:58] mn015 | because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever
"[06:06] mn015 | you know , can throw it on there ."
"[06:08] mn015 | So only the tiramisu is free ,"
[06:10] mn015 | nothing else .
"[06:13] me003 | Well , I 'm going"
"[06:15] me003 | back to visit my parents this weekend , so , I 'll be out of town ."
[06:18] mn015 | So you 're going to the west Bay then ?
"[06:21] mn015 | No , south Bay ?"
"[06:21] me003 | No , the South Bay , yeah ."
[06:22] mn015 | South Bay .
"[06:25] me012 | Well , I should be free , so ."
"[06:27] mn015 | OK , I 'll let you know ."
[06:28] me010 | I 'm sorry . I was looking for you guys downstairs . I didn't know that you had moved the meeting . Alright .
[06:28] me012 | OK .
[06:39] me003 | We are .
[06:40] me010 | Alright .
[06:46] me003 | Is Nancy s uh gonna show up ?
"[06:48] me010 | She 's got a student with her now . So , she probably won't ."
[06:51] me003 | Mmm .
[06:58] me003 | Wonder if these things ever
"[06:59] me003 | emit a very ,"
"[07:01] me003 | like , piercing screech right in your ear ?"
"[07:05] me010 | No , no . The Human Subjects Committee wouldn't allow it ."
[07:11] mn015 | They are gonna get more comfortable headsets .
[07:13] me010 | Good .
[07:14] mn015 | They already ordered them .
[07:16] me010 | Uh - huh .
[07:19] mn015 | OK .
[07:21] mn015 | Let 's get started .
"[07:25] mn015 | Should I go first , with the uh ,"
"[07:31] mn015 | um ,"
[07:34] mn015 | data . Can I have the remote control . Thank you .
[07:52] mn015 | OK .
[07:54] mn015 | So . On Friday we had our wizard test data test
[08:07] mn015 | This was the introduction .
"[08:08] mn015 | I actually uh ,"
"[08:11] mn015 | even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject , I"
"[08:15] mn015 | sort of felt that she knew too much , so I asked uh Litonya ."
[08:20] mn015 | just
[08:21] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:21] mn015 | on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh"
"[08:26] mn015 | serve as the first subject . So , this is what she saw as part of as uh for instr introduction , this is what she had to read"
"[08:38] mn015 | Uh , that was really difficult for her"
"[08:43] me012 | Because of l all the names , you mean ?"
[08:44] mn015 | The names and um
[08:57] mn015 | and um
"[09:00] mn015 | then of course the system broke down , and those were the l uh"
[09:14] mn015 | Um .
[09:16] mn015 | There are here are uh the results .
[09:23] mn015 | Mmm .
"[09:31] fe903 | Culture on every corner , and more than ten museums @ @ five playhouses , city theater Zwinger three . Visit our parts of the civi"
[09:34] mn015 | We will skip the reading now . D
[09:36] mn015 | Um .
[09:42] mn015 | And um .
[09:50] fe046 | Thank you for calling Heidelberg Tourist Information . How may I help you ?
"[09:54] me012 | Wait , can I I have a question . So ."
[09:55] fe903 | Hi . I want to um
"[09:58] me012 | So there 's no system , right ? Like , there was a wizard for both uh both parts , is this right ?"
[10:04] mn015 | Yeah . It was bo it both times the same person .
[10:07] me012 | OK .
"[10:12] me012 | And she didn't I mean . Well . Isn't this kind of obvious when it says "" OK now you 're talking to a human "" and then the human has the same voice ?"
[10:19] mn015 | No no no .
[10:19] mn015 | We u Wait .
"[10:21] mn015 | OK , good question , but uh"
[10:23] mn015 | you you just wait and see .
[10:24] mn015 | It 's You 're gonna l learn .
[10:24] me012 | OK .
"[10:31] mn015 | Because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless ,"
[10:37] mn015 | we have to move her closer .
[10:39] fe903 | I 'm deciding on going to the concert of the Hindelberg for the Hindelberg Symphony Orchestra .
[10:45] fe903 | I want to buy something elegant in one of the designer boutiques
[10:50] fe903 | which is located on Friedrich Ebert um Anlage ? Do you understand that ?
"[11:02] fe046 | In order to get to the Friedrich Ebert Anlage , turn around and go towards the church . Next you have to t at the church into the Friedrich Ebert Anlage ."
[11:15] fe903 | OK .
"[11:21] me003 | Is she mispronouncing "" Anlage "" ? Is it "" Anlaga "" or "" Anlunga """
[11:25] fe903 | I want @ @ what a um sunken castle is .
"[11:33] fe046 | A sunken castle differs from the regular sort of castle in that it is built in a flat region , rather than on a mountain ."
[11:43] fe903 | OK .
"[12:01] fe046 | In order to get to the student prison , from the university square , turn right , and walk one block ."
[12:18] fe903 | OK .
[12:26] fe046 | Hello ?
[12:26] fe903 | Yes .
"[12:27] fe046 | Uh , I 'm sorry , something uh seems to have happened to the system . Um , see if I can help you ."
[12:35] fe903 | Are you a live person ? or is this a recording ?
[12:40] fe046 | Th - I 'm a live person .
"[12:41] fe903 | OK . Um , thing I was gonna ask you , um , OK ,"
[12:49] fe903 | @ @
"[12:50] fe046 | I need to know where you are , first of all"
"[12:54] fe903 | W where am I ? Um , I don't know ."
[13:03] fe046 | See c figure it out ?
[13:06] fe903 | I see a building that 's um under construction .
"[13:12] fe046 | OK , uh - huh ."
[13:15] fe046 | That 's p that 's probably the university square .
"[13:18] fe903 | OK . So , that 's where I am ."
"[13:21] fe046 | OK . So , uh , what do you need to do ?"
[13:22] fe903 | Um .
"[13:24] fe903 | Can you give me a description of the Powder - Tower , at the Hindelberg castle ?"
"[13:31] fe046 | Yeah , in order to get there you have to take a bus , you 've got to take the number forty - two"
[13:37] fe903 | Uh - huh .
[13:38] fe046 | To the town hall station . And then you have to transfer to the funicular train . And take the castle exit and turn right . And after about half a mile you 'll see the the Powder - Tower on your right hand side .
[13:50] fe903 | OK . And How much is it for the train and the bus ?
"[13:58] fe046 | Um , you can get a a transfer on the on the bus for the train for about uh four marks ."
"[14:05] fe903 | OK . OK , that 's it ."
[14:11] fe046 | That 's all you need to do ?
"[14:12] fe903 | Mm - hmm , thanks for your help ."
"[14:13] fe046 | Sure , bye - bye ."
[14:24] mn015 | Yeah .
[14:25] fe903 | But it was a real person .
[14:30] fe903 | Did I call Europe ?
[14:31] fe903 | @ @
"[14:32] mn015 | "" Did I call Europe ? "" So , this is it ."
[14:33] fe903 | @ @
[14:39] mn015 | We had her fooled in the beginning . She thought it was a recording in the beginning and was surprised that a human came on .
"[14:45] mn015 | Um , maybe she had some doubts later on whether the first part was a recording or not , but while she was speaking to it , she didn't ."
"[14:51] me010 | So , are are you trying to record this meeting ?"
[14:56] mn015 | There was a strange reflex .
"[14:59] mn015 | I have a headache . I 'm really sort of out of it . OK , the uh"
[15:04] mn015 | lessons learned . The reading needs to be shorter . Five minutes is just too long .
"[15:07] mn015 | Um ,"
"[15:09] mn015 | that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order . And uh she did not . She No . She she jumped around quite a bit ."
[15:22] me012 | Really ?
"[15:23] me012 | Oh , it 's surprising ."
"[15:25] me010 | S so if you just number them "" one "" , "" two "" , "" three "" it 's"
[15:29] me010 | OK .
[15:31] me010 | Right .
"[15:31] mn015 | Um . We need to So that 's one thing . And we need a better introduction for the wizard . That is something that Fey actually thought of a in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called ."
[15:41] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[15:43] me010 | True .
"[15:44] mn015 | And um , um , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks . So when when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth . So we get nice um data for that ."
[16:01] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:04] mn015 | Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far ,"
"[16:10] mn015 | in order to avoid this rephrasing , so where , even though w we don't tell the person "" ask blah - blah - blah - blah - blah """
"[16:18] mn015 | they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um"
[16:21] me012 | Say exactly what 's on there ? Yeah .
[16:21] mn015 | repeat as much of that text as possible .
"[16:26] mn015 | And uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job , in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not"
[16:31] me010 | Great .
"[16:36] mn015 | asked for , "" How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer "" so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure ."
[16:42] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[16:43] mn015 | Um . Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard . So um .
"[16:54] me003 | uh "" not a man "" ."
[17:01] me003 | Are you sure ?
"[17:02] me012 | No , I don't know . Not that I know of ."
[17:03] me010 | Right .
"[17:05] me003 | Yeah , that 's so @ @ ."
[17:05] me010 | Right .
[17:06] me010 | Right .
[17:08] mn015 | OK .
[17:08] me010 | Uh .
[17:23] me012 | Ah .
[17:27] mn015 | while partaking in the data
[17:30] mn015 | collection .
"[17:32] me010 | OK , great ."
"[17:34] me010 | So first of all , I agree that um we should hire Fey , and start paying her . Probably pay for the time she 's put in as well ."
"[17:46] me010 | Um , do you know exactly how to do that , or is uh Lila I mean , you know what exactly do we do to to put her on the payroll in some way ?"
"[17:56] mn015 | I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn ."
"[17:57] me010 | OK . Well , you 'll have to . Right . So anyway , um"
[18:00] mn015 | N
[18:02] me010 | So why don't you uh ask Lila
[18:05] me010 | and see what she says about you know exactly what we do for someone in
"[18:14] me010 | Well , yeah she 's un she 's not a a student , she just graduated but anyway . So i if Yeah , I agree , she sounded fine , she"
[18:19] mn015 | Hmm .
"[18:23] me010 | a actually was uh , more"
"[18:28] me010 | uh , present and stuff than than she was in conversation , so she did a better job than I would have guessed from just"
[18:36] mn015 | Yeah .
[18:37] me010 | talking to her . So I think that 's great .
"[18:38] mn015 | This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison , and I didn't even spell it out here and in some cases I I spelled it out a little bit um"
[18:43] me010 | Yeah .
[18:49] me010 | Right .
"[18:50] mn015 | more thoroughly , this is the information on on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up ,"
"[18:57] mn015 | and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better ."
[19:11] me010 | And also if she 's willing to take on the job of organizing all those subjects and stuff that would be wonderful .
[19:21] mn015 | Mmm .
"[19:21] me010 | And , uh"
"[19:23] me010 | she 's actually she 's going to graduate school in a kind of an experimental paradigm , so I think this is all just fine in terms of h her learning things she 's gonna need to know"
[19:31] mn015 | Mmm .
[19:42] mn015 | Yep . Yeah she she didn't explicitly state that so .
[19:47] me010 | Great .
[19:47] mn015 | And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people .
[19:58] mn015 | She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that so .
"[20:05] me010 | Well , as I say there is this s set of people next door , it 's not hard to"
[20:08] mn015 | Yeah .
"[20:09] mn015 | However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there ."
"[20:13] mn015 | And um , we 'll see ."
"[20:15] me010 | Yeah . We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something , but"
[20:18] mn015 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[20:29] me010 | um
[20:30] me010 | you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff . And and there 'll probably be self - selection to some extent .
[20:34] mn015 | Mmm .
[20:37] mn015 | Yep .
"[20:40] me010 | Uh ,"
[20:42] me010 | so that 's good . Um .
[20:43] mn015 | OK .
"[20:45] me010 | Now , I signed us up for the Wednesday slot ,"
"[20:50] me010 | and part of what we should do is this . So ,"
"[20:55] me010 | uh , partly we 'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists , but partly I did want it to get the linguists involved"
[21:03] me010 | in some of this issue about what the task is and
"[21:06] me010 | all um you know , what the dialogue is , and what 's going on linguistically ,"
"[21:12] me010 | because to the extent that we can get them contributing ,"
[21:16] me010 | that will be good .
[21:17] mn015 | Yep .
[21:17] me010 | So this issue about
"[21:18] me010 | you know re - formulating things , maybe we can get some of the linguists sufficiently interested that they 'll help us with it ,"
"[21:26] me010 | uh , other linguists , if you 're a linguist , but in any case , um ,"
[21:28] mn015 | Yep .
[21:30] me010 | the linguistics students and stuff .
[21:31] me010 | So my idea on on Wednesday is partly
"[21:35] me010 | to uh you I mean , what you did today would i is just fine . You just uh do "" this is what we did , and here 's the thing , and here 's s some of the dialogue and and"
"[21:45] me010 | so forth . """
"[21:46] me010 | But then , the other thing of course is we should"
[21:48] me010 | um give the computer scientists some idea of of
"[21:52] me010 | what 's going on with the system design , and where we think the belief - nets fit in and where the pieces are and stuff like that ."
[22:00] mn015 | Yep .
[22:01] me010 | Is is this make sense to everybody ? Yeah .
"[22:05] me010 | So , I don't I don't think it 's worth"
[22:12] me010 | you don't have to make any new uh PowerPoint or anything . I think we got plenty of stuff
[22:18] me010 | to talk about .
"[22:20] me010 | And , then um"
[22:23] me010 | just see how a discussion goes .
[22:25] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[22:27] mn015 | Sounds good . The uh
[22:30] mn015 | other two things is um
[22:36] mn015 | can have Johno tell us a little about this
[22:39] me010 | Great .
"[22:40] mn015 | and we also have a l little bit on the interface , M - three - L enhancement , and then um that was it , I think ."
"[22:51] me003 | So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net because"
[22:59] me003 | I was I I took I tried to
[23:02] me003 | conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out so what I did was I took I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that
[23:09] me010 | Yep .
[23:10] me003 | would isolate the things related to the trajector . And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .
[23:14] me010 | Yep .
"[23:15] me003 | And I separated them out . And then I um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot ,"
"[23:24] me003 | um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer ."
[23:29] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[23:36] me003 | So .
[23:39] me010 | Slide all the way up so we see what the p the p
"[23:40] me010 | very bottom looks like , or is that it ?"
[23:44] mn015 | Yeah .
[23:48] me003 | So basically all I did was I took the last belief - net
[23:51] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[23:52] me003 | and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to
[23:57] me003 | uh image schemas that would be related . And the two that I came up with
[23:59] me010 | Yep .
[24:01] me003 | were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .
[24:04] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:05] me003 | And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably ."
"[24:09] me010 | Right , yep ."
"[24:10] me003 | Um ,"
"[24:11] me003 | you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,"
[24:15] me010 | Right .
[24:16] me003 | or they were hurried . That 's kind of related to that . And then um
"[24:25] me003 | Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one but"
[24:29] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[24:41] me003 | something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever .
"[24:45] me003 | "" Travel constraints "" would be something like"
"[24:47] me003 | you know , maybe they said they can they only wanna take a bus or something like that , right ?"
"[24:50] me003 | And then those are somewhat related to the path , so that would"
[24:51] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[24:53] me003 | determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly .
"[24:58] me003 | Um , "" Goal "" ."
[25:01] me003 | Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .
"[25:09] me003 | Um ,"
"[25:11] me003 | and then if you go up ,"
"[25:19] me003 | um ,"
"[25:21] me003 | in terms of Context , what we had currently said was"
[25:25] me003 | whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other
[25:28] me003 | person .
"[25:30] me003 | Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines ."
[25:37] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:39] me003 | Uh , Prosody I don't really I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context ,"
[25:44] me003 | so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it
"[25:45] me010 | Right , OK ."
[25:50] me003 | is is that .
"[25:51] me003 | Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose , and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of"
"[25:56] me003 | whether they said "" I need to get there quickly "" or whatever ."
[25:57] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:58] me003 | And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot ."
"[26:07] mn015 | What 's "" tourbook "" ?"
"[26:09] me003 | Tourbook ? That would be , I don't know , the "" landmark - iness "" of things ,"
[26:12] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[26:14] me003 | whether it 's in the tourbook or not .
[26:23] me010 | what you got .
[26:24] me010 | I don't yet understand how you would use it . So let me see if I can ask
[26:33] me010 | a s
"[26:33] me003 | Well , this is not a working Bayes - net ."
[26:35] me010 | Right .
"[26:36] me010 | No , I understand that , but but um"
"[26:41] me010 | So ,"
[26:42] me010 | Let 's slide back up again and see start at the at the bottom and
[26:47] me010 | Oop - bo - doop - boop - boop . Yeah .
"[26:49] me010 | So ,"
[26:50] me010 | you could imagine
[26:53] me010 | w
"[26:54] me010 | Uh ,"
"[26:55] me010 | go ahead , you were about to go up there and point to something ."
"[26:57] me003 | Well I OK , I just Say what you were gonna say . OK ."
"[26:58] me010 | Good , do it ! No no , go do it ."
"[27:07] me010 | Oh , OK . So , so if you if we made if we wanted to make it into a a real uh Bayes - net ,"
[27:18] me003 | So we 'd have to get rid of this
[27:19] me003 | and connect these things directly to the Mode .
[27:25] me003 | Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .
"[27:27] me010 | Well , here 's the problem ."
"[27:30] me010 | And and uh Bhaskara and I was talking about this a little earlier today is , if we just do this , we could wind up with a huge"
"[27:39] me010 | uh ,"
[27:41] me010 | combinatoric input to the Mode thing .
"[27:46] me003 | Well I oh yeah , I unders I understand that , I just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that ."
"[27:50] me010 | Well , i But that 's what we have to do ."
[27:51] me003 | OK .
"[27:52] me010 | OK , so , so ,"
[27:54] me010 | uh .
[27:59] me010 | There there are a variety of ways of doing it .
[28:01] me010 | Uh . Let me just mention something that I don't want to pursue today which is
"[28:05] me010 | there are technical ways of doing it , uh I I slipped a paper to Bhaskara"
[28:09] me010 | and about Noisy - OR 's and Noisy - MAXes and
[28:13] me010 | there 're ways to
[28:14] me010 | uh sort of back off on the purity of your Bayes - net - edness .
[28:18] me003 | Mmm .
"[28:19] me010 | Uh ,"
[28:20] me010 | so . If you co you could ima and I now I don't
"[28:23] me010 | know that any of those actually apply in this case , but there is some technology you could try to apply ."
[28:32] me010 | Yeah .
[28:32] me003 | OK .
[28:33] me010 | Yeah .
"[28:34] me010 | And , um"
[28:38] me010 | So .
"[28:40] me003 | So in that case , the sum we 'd have we I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes . We 'd have the summary nodes like where the things were I guess maybe if thi if things were related to business or"
[28:49] me010 | So what I was gonna say is is maybe a good at this point
[28:49] me003 | Yeah .
[28:53] me010 | is to
"[28:55] me010 | try to informally I mean , not necessarily in th in this meeting ,"
[28:59] me010 | but to try to informally think about what the decision variables are .
"[29:04] me010 | So , if you have some bottom line"
"[29:07] me010 | uh decision about which mode ,"
"[29:09] me010 | you know , what are the most relevant things ."
[29:11] me003 | Mmm .
"[29:12] me010 | And the other trick , which is not a technical trick , it 's kind of a knowledge engineering trick ,"
[29:16] me010 | is to make the n each node sufficiently narrow
[29:22] me010 | that you don't get this combinatorics . So
[29:25] me010 | that if you decided
"[29:26] me010 | that you could characterize the decision as a trade - off between three factors , whatever they may be ,"
"[29:32] me010 | OK ? then you could say "" Aha , let 's have these three factors "" ,"
"[29:37] me010 | OK ? and maybe a binary version f for each , or"
[29:39] me010 | some relatively compact
[29:42] me010 | decision node just above the final one .
[29:45] me003 | Mmm .
"[29:45] me010 | And then the question would be if if those are the things that you care about ,"
[29:49] me010 | uh can you make a relatively compact way of getting
[29:53] me010 | from the various inputs to the things you care about .
[29:57] me010 | So that y
"[29:57] me010 | so that , you know , you can sort of try to do a knowledge engineering thing"
[29:58] me003 | OK .
[30:01] me010 | given that we 're not gonna screw with the
[30:04] me010 | technology and just always use
"[30:06] me010 | uh sort of orthodox Bayes - nets , then we have a knowledge engineering little problem of"
[30:11] me010 | how do we do that .
[30:22] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:23] me010 | Well ,"
"[30:24] me010 | mmm ,"
"[30:24] me010 | something . I mean , so"
"[30:26] me010 | uh , Robert has thought about this problem f for a long time , cuz he 's had these examples"
"[30:32] me010 | kicking around , so he may have some good intuition"
[30:35] me010 | about
"[30:36] me010 | you know , what are the crucial things ."
[30:38] me003 | Mmm .
"[30:39] me010 | and ,"
"[30:40] me010 | um ,"
[30:46] me010 | this is a way of
[30:48] me010 | playing with this abs Source - path - goal trajector exp uh uh abstraction and and sort of sh displaying it in a particular way .
[30:57] me003 | Yeah .
"[30:58] me010 | Uh ,"
[30:59] me010 | I don't think our friends
"[31:08] me010 | Well , maybe they will . Well , let me think about whether whether I think we can present this to them or not ."
"[31:13] me010 | Um ,"
"[31:18] me010 | Uh ,"
"[31:21] mn015 | Well , I think this is still , I mean ,"
[31:24] mn015 | ad - hoc . This is sort of th the second
"[31:29] mn015 | you know , a a whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot ,"
[31:34] mn015 | not really as a Bayes - net as John Johno said .
"[31:36] me003 | We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way ,"
[31:39] me003 | in the sense that it would make it more abstract .
[31:39] mn015 | Yeah .
"[31:44] mn015 | the the nice thing is that you know , it just"
[31:46] mn015 | is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple
[31:52] mn015 | clearly have to be specified m more carefully and uh
"[31:55] me010 | Alright , well , le let me think about this some more ,"
[31:58] me010 | and uh see if we can
[32:02] me010 | find a way to
[32:05] me010 | present this
[32:08] me010 | to this linguists group that that is helpful to them .
[32:12] mn015 | ultimately we we may w w
[32:20] mn015 | in thinking about the problem
[32:22] mn015 | and maybe a first version of uh
"[32:27] mn015 | a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask ,"
"[32:32] mn015 | that you can give input and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you ,"
"[32:36] mn015 | uh throw the die for you , because um"
[32:38] mn015 | I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in in the same way as
[32:45] mn015 | much the same way we can um
[32:51] mn015 | this thing .
[32:54] mn015 | So if this is what M - three - L um
"[32:59] mn015 | will look like and what it 'll give us ,"
"[33:03] mn015 | um And a very simple thing . We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace ."
[33:07] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:10] mn015 | And this these uh this changed now only um ,"
[33:16] mn015 | It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once .
"[33:19] mn015 | Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is "" Approach """
[33:23] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[33:25] me010 | Good .
"[33:25] mn015 | and could be , you know , more refined uh"
[33:30] mn015 | in many ways . Or we can uh
[33:33] mn015 | have something where the uh
[33:36] mn015 | goal is a public place
"[33:39] mn015 | and it will give us then of course an action type of the type "" Enter "" ."
"[33:46] mn015 | um ,"
"[33:47] mn015 | on this one feature ,"
[33:48] mn015 | and that 's that 's about all you can do .
[33:51] mn015 | And so in the f if this pla if the object type
"[33:55] mn015 | um here is is a m is a landmark ,"
"[33:58] mn015 | of course it 'll be um "" Vista "" ."
[34:03] mn015 | And um
[34:05] mn015 | this is about as much as we can do
[34:07] mn015 | if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify
"[34:13] mn015 | "" OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case "" , and so forth , it just gets really really messy ."
[34:19] mn015 | Hmm ?
[34:20] me010 | It was much too quick for me .
"[34:22] me010 | OK , so let me see if I understand what you 're saying ."
"[34:25] me010 | So , I I do understand that"
[34:28] me010 | uh you can take the M - three - L and
[34:32] me010 | add not and it w
"[34:33] me010 | and you need to do this , for sure , we have to add , you know , not too much about"
[34:37] me010 | um
"[34:38] me010 | object types and stuff ,"
[34:40] me010 | and what I think you did
[34:43] me010 | is add some rules of the style that are already there that say
"[34:47] me010 | "" If it 's of type "" Landmark "" , then you"
"[34:51] me010 | take you 're gonna take a picture of it . """
[34:53] mn015 | Exactly .
"[34:53] me010 | F full stop , I mean , that 's what you do ."
"[34:55] me010 | Ev - every landmark you take a picture of ,"
"[34:58] mn015 | Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible ."
[35:03] me010 | OK .
"[35:04] me010 | Uh ,"
[35:05] me010 | and certainly you can add rules like that to
[35:09] me010 | the existing SmartKom system .
"[35:12] me010 | And you just did , right ? OK ."
[35:14] mn015 | Yeah .
[35:14] mn015 | And it it would do us no good . That Ultimately .
[35:16] me010 | Ah .
[35:17] mn015 | W
"[35:18] me010 | Well . So , s well , and let 's think about this ."
"[35:21] me010 | Um ,"
"[35:22] me010 | that 's a that 's another kind of baseline case , that 's another sort of thing "" OK ,"
[35:26] me010 | here 's a another kind of minimal
"[35:29] me010 | uh way of tackling this "" ."
[35:36] me010 | You do that .
"[35:38] me010 | Um , then the question would be"
[35:41] me010 | Uh
"[35:43] me010 | Now , if that 's all you 're doing ,"
"[35:45] me010 | then you can get the types from the ontology ,"
[35:49] me010 | OK ? because
[35:51] me010 | that 's all you 're all you 're using is this type the types in the ontology and you 're done .
[35:54] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[35:55] me010 | Right ? So we don't we don't use the discourse , we don't use the context , we don't do any of those things ."
[36:01] mn015 | No .
"[36:02] me010 | but that 's OK , and I mean it it 's again a kind of"
[36:06] me010 | one minimal extension
[36:10] me010 | of the existing things .
[36:12] me010 | And that 's something the uh
"[36:14] me010 | SmartKom people themselves would they 'd say "" Sure , that 's no problem you know , no problem to add types to the ont "" Right ?"
[36:23] mn015 | Yeah .
"[36:24] mn015 | No . And this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um we have"
[36:36] mn015 | this this silly
[36:38] mn015 | uh interface and we have
[36:47] me010 | Hmm .
"[36:48] mn015 | I whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever . This will"
[36:54] me010 | Yeah .
[36:55] me010 | Yeah .
[36:57] mn015 | um be um a job to find ways of writing down
"[37:03] mn015 | Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some some form ,"
"[37:08] mn015 | and have this be in a in a in the content , loosely called "" Constructicon "" ."
[37:14] mn015 | And the rules we want to throw away completely .
"[37:18] mn015 | And um and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net , which is exactly getting the input feeding into here . This decides"
"[37:29] mn015 | whether it 's an whether action the the Enter , the Vista ,"
[37:36] mn015 | or the whatever
[37:38] mn015 | uh
"[37:39] mn015 | Approach um construction should be activated ,"
"[37:39] me010 | That 's what you said Yeah , that 's fine ."
[37:43] mn015 | IE just pasted in .
"[37:45] me010 | Right . But it 's not construction there , it 's action ."
[37:47] me010 | Construction is a d is a different story .
[37:49] me003 | Right . This is uh so what we 'd be generating would be
[37:53] me003 | a reference to a semantic
[37:58] me003 | for the X - schema ?
[37:59] me010 | Yes .
[37:59] me003 | OK .
[38:00] me010 | So that that uh i if you had the
"[38:06] me010 | generalized "" Go "" X - schema and you wanted to specialize it to these three ones , then you would have to supply the parameters ."
[38:13] me003 | Right .
[38:14] me010 | And then
"[38:16] me010 | uh , although we haven't worried about this yet , you might wanna worry about something that would"
[38:22] me010 | go to the GIS
[38:24] me010 | and use that to actually get
"[38:27] me010 | you know , detailed route planning . So , you know , where do you do take a picture of it and stuff like that ."
[38:32] me003 | Mm - hmm .
[38:32] me010 | But that 's
[38:34] me010 | not It 's not the immediate problem .
[38:36] me003 | Right .
[38:41] me003 | So the immediate problem is just deciding w
[38:48] me003 | Yeah .
"[38:55] me003 | Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?"
[38:57] me010 | Yeah .
[38:58] me010 | Right .
"[38:59] me010 | Right . Well , that that actually is relatively easy in this case ."
[39:03] me003 | OK .
[39:03] me010 | The harder problem is
"[39:04] me010 | we decide what we want to use , how are we gonna get it ?"
"[39:07] me010 | And that the the that 's the hardest problem . So , the hardest problem is"
[39:11] me010 | how are you going to get this information
[39:15] me010 | what the person says and the context and the ontology .
[39:19] me010 | The h
"[39:20] me010 | So , I think that 's the hardest problem at the moment is is"
[39:21] me003 | OK .
[39:23] me010 | where are you gonna how are you gonna g get this information .
"[39:27] me010 | Um , and that 's so , getting back to here , uh , we have a d a technical problem with the belief - nets that we we"
[39:36] me010 | don't want all the com
[39:38] me010 | too many factors if we if we allow them to just go combinatorially .
[39:39] me003 | Right .
[39:42] me010 | So we wanna think about which ones we really care about
[39:52] me003 | So what we really wanna do i cuz this is really just the three layer
"[39:55] me003 | net , we wanna b"
[39:56] me010 | Right .
[39:57] me003 | make it expand it out into more layers basically ?
[39:59] me010 | We might .
"[40:00] me010 | Uh ,"
"[40:01] me010 | I mean that that 's certainly one thing we can do . Uh , it 's true that"
"[40:08] me010 | the way you have this ,"
[40:13] me010 | what you 're having is the values rather than the variable .
[40:22] me003 | Right .
"[40:22] me003 | So instead of in instead it should really be just be "" intention "" as a node instead of "" intention business "" or "" intention tour "" ."
"[40:27] me010 | Yeah , right , and then it would have values , uh , "" Tour "" , "" Business "" , or uh "" Hurried "" ."
[40:28] me003 | Right .
"[40:33] me010 | But then but i it still some knowledge design to do , about i how do you wanna break this up , what really matters ."
[40:36] me003 | Right .
"[40:39] me010 | I mean , it 's fine ."
"[40:40] me010 | You know , we have to it 's it 's iterative . We 're gonna have to work with it some ."
[40:42] me003 | I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have
[40:45] me003 | a business intention and a touring intention and
[40:48] me003 | the probabilities of
"[40:51] me010 | Well , you you could do that . And it 's perfectly OK to uh insist that that , you know , th"
"[40:58] me010 | um , they add up to one ,"
[41:01] me010 | but that there 's uh that that it doesn't have to be one zero zero .
[41:04] me003 | Mmm . OK .
[41:05] me010 | OK . So you could have the conditional p
[41:08] me010 | each of these things is gonna be a a a probability .
"[41:11] me010 | So whenever there 's a choice ,"
[41:21] me010 | Absolutely right .
[41:22] me003 | OK .
[41:23] me010 | And so that you might want to then have those b
[41:25] me010 | Th - Then they may have to be separate . They may not be able to be values of the same
[41:32] me010 | variable .
"[41:33] me010 | So that 's but again , this is this is the sort of knowledge design you have to go through ."
"[41:39] me003 | Yeah , this is just more"
"[41:41] me003 | me taking last the last one , and saying "" how can I formalize this ? "" @ @"
[41:44] me010 | Right .
[41:53] me010 | toward where we wanna go .
"[42:03] mn015 | uh , a specification for some interface , here that um"
"[42:12] mn015 | takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it . Then we discussed in our pre - edu EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology"
"[42:27] mn015 | um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one ,"
"[42:35] mn015 | we may wanna decide we can do this from here , but we also could do it um"
[42:39] mn015 | you know if we have a a a belief - net interface .
"[42:43] mn015 | So the belief - net takes as input , a vector , right ?"
[42:47] mn015 | of stuff .
[42:53] mn015 | Yeah .
"[42:53] mn015 | And um it Output is whatever ,"
[42:58] mn015 | as well .
"[42:59] mn015 | But this information is just M - three - L ,"
[43:04] mn015 | and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff
"[43:09] mn015 | in the maybe we want to ask the real world , maybe you want to look something up in the GRS , but also we definitely want to"
[43:15] mn015 | look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff . Based on we we have uh I was just made some examples from the ontology
"[43:25] mn015 | and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this , but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth"
"[43:37] mn015 | and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history , "" were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? "" , "" were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? "" ,"
[43:45] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[43:50] me012 | Right .
[44:06] me010 | Yeah . I think that 's I think that 's exactly right .
"[44:08] me010 | There will be rules , but they aren't rules that come to final decisions , they 're rules that gather information for a decision process ."
[44:16] mn015 | Yeah .
"[44:16] me010 | Yeah , no I think that 's that 's just fine ."
"[44:23] me010 | Uh , yeah . So they 'll they presumably there 'll be"
"[44:28] me010 | a thread or process or something that "" Agent "" ,"
"[44:31] me010 | yeah , "" Agent "" , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah ,"
"[44:40] me010 | can do things like that . And um there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision , so it probably will ."
[44:55] me010 | My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um
"[45:01] me010 | can go off and get information ,"
"[45:05] me003 | Turn the crank , yeah ."
"[45:06] me010 | turn a crank in the belief - net , that 'll come out with s"
"[45:08] me010 | uh more another vector ,"
"[45:10] me010 | OK ,"
[45:10] me010 | which can then be
[45:12] me010 | uh applied
[45:15] me010 | at what we would call the simulation or action end . So you now know what you 're gonna do and
"[45:21] me010 | that may actually involve getting more information . So on once you pull that out , it could be that that says "" Ah ! Now that we know that we gonna go ask the ontology something else . """
[45:29] me003 | Mmm .
"[45:30] me010 | OK ? Now that we know that it 's a bus trip ,"
"[45:33] me010 | OK ? we didn't We didn't need to know beforehand , uh how long the bus trip takes or whatever , but but now that"
[45:39] me010 | we know that 's the way it 's coming out then we gotta go find out more . So I think that 's OK .
[45:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[45:47] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:53] mn015 | So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that"
"[45:57] mn015 | is um ,"
[46:03] mn015 | Yeah .
"[46:04] mn015 | I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the "" cognitive dispatcher "" ,"
[46:11] me010 | OK .
"[46:11] mn015 | which does nothing , but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out , there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do and then collect"
[46:24] mn015 | uh sub - objects and then
[46:27] mn015 | recombine them and put them together .
"[46:29] mn015 | So maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it ,"
[46:34] mn015 | and uh
"[46:36] me010 | Oh , OK . Uh ."
"[46:37] mn015 | get this part , then . Yeah ."
"[46:39] me010 | I confess , I 'm still"
[46:43] me010 | not completely comfortable with the overall story . Um .
[46:49] me010 | I
"[46:50] me010 | i This this is not a complaint , this is a promise to do more work ."
[46:54] me010 | So I 'm gonna hafta think about it some more . Um .
"[47:00] me010 | see what we 'd like to do ,"
"[47:02] me010 | and and this has been implicit in the discussion ,"
[47:04] me010 | is to
[47:06] me010 | do this in such a way that you get a lot of re - use .
[47:10] me010 | So . What you 're trying to get out of this deep co cognitive linguistics
"[47:14] me010 | is the fact that w if you know about source source , paths and goals , and nnn all this sort of stuff ,"
"[47:18] me010 | that a lot of this is the same ,"
"[47:23] me010 | uh there 's there 's some some important generalities that you 're getting , so that you don't take each and every one of these tasks and hafta re - do it ."
[47:31] me010 | And I don't yet see how that goes .
[47:35] me010 | Alright .
[47:35] mn015 | There 're no primitives upon which uh yeah .
[47:35] me010 | u u
"[47:40] me010 | just there saying eee well you I know how to do any individual case ,"
[47:44] me003 | Right .
[47:45] me010 | right ? but I don't yet see what 's the really interesting question is can you use uh deep
[47:50] me010 | uh cognitive linguistics to get powerful generalizations .
[47:55] me010 | And um
[47:55] mn015 | Yep .
"[47:58] mn015 | Maybe we sho should we a add then the "" what 's this ? """
[48:03] mn015 | domain ?
[48:04] mn015 | N
"[48:05] mn015 | I mean , we have to "" how do I get to X "" ."
"[48:07] mn015 | Then we also have the "" what 's this ? "" domain ,"
[48:09] me012 | Right .
[48:09] me010 | Could . Uh .
"[48:13] mn015 | Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them "" intentions "" anymore . So he he dislikes the term ."
[48:14] me010 | Yeah .
[48:18] me003 | I didn't @ @ .
"[48:18] me010 | Well , I I don't like the term either , so I have n i uh"
[48:22] me010 | i i y w i i
"[48:26] mn015 | But um , I 'm sure the "" what 's this ? "" questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects ."
"[48:33] me010 | Could be . I 'm not a I 'm not op particularly opposed to adding that or any other task , I mean , eventually we 're gonna want a whole range of them ."
[48:33] mn015 | So .
[48:39] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[48:40] me012 | That 's right .
"[48:41] me010 | Uh ,"
[48:43] me010 | I 'm just saying that
[48:44] me010 | I 'm gonna hafta do some sort of first principles thinking about this . I just at the moment don't know . H
[48:49] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[48:56] me003 | Seems like it has to be specific .
[48:57] me010 | The Bayes - nets will be dec specific for each decision . But what I 'd like to be able to do
[48:59] me003 | OK .
"[49:01] me010 | is to have the way that you extract properties ,"
"[49:06] me010 | that will go into different Bayes - nets , be"
[49:09] me010 | the uh general .
[49:10] me003 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:10] me010 | So that if you have sources , you have trajectors and stuff like that , and there 's a language for talking about trajectors ,"
[49:16] me010 | you shouldn't have to do that differently
[49:19] me003 | Right . OK .
"[49:20] me010 | for uh uh going to something , than for circling it , for uh telling someone else how to go there , whatever it is ."
[49:31] me010 | the decision processes are gonna be different
[49:35] me010 | What you 'd really like of course is the same thing you 'd always like which is that you have
[49:41] me010 | um a kind of intermediate representation which looks the same o over a bunch of inputs and a bunch of outputs .
[49:51] me010 | and all sorts of different ways of expressing them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going on .
[50:00] me010 | And
[50:01] me010 | that 's that would be the really pretty result .
[50:03] me003 | Right .
[50:04] me010 | And
"[50:06] me010 | pushing it one step further , when you get to construction grammar and stuff , what you 'd like to be able to do is say you have this parser which is much fancier than the parser that comes with"
"[50:15] me010 | uh SmartKom , i that that actually uses constructions and is able to tell from this construction"
[50:15] me003 | The SmartKom.
"[50:23] me010 | that there 's uh something about the intent you know , the actual what people wanna do or what they 're referring to and stuff ,"
[50:26] me003 | Mm - hmm .
[50:29] me010 | in independent of
"[50:32] me010 | whether it about what is this or where is it or something ,"
"[50:35] me010 | that you could tell from the construction , you could pull out deep semantic information which you 're gonna use in a general way ."
[50:43] me003 | Somehow you 'd know that you needed to find out whether there something was a landmark or something like that ?
[50:47] me010 | You might .
[50:47] me003 | Yeah .
[50:47] me010 | You might .
[50:48] me010 | You might be able to to uh
[50:52] me010 | say that this i this is the kind of construction
[50:57] me010 | there 's Let 's say there 's a uh cont
[50:59] me010 | there the the land
[51:00] me010 | the construction implies the there 's a con this thing is being viewed as a container .
[51:05] me003 | Mmm .
[51:05] me010 | OK .
[51:06] me010 | So just from this local construction
[51:09] me010 | you know that you 're gonna hafta treat it as a container you might as well go off and get that information . And that may effect the way you process everything else .
"[51:17] me010 | So if you say "" how do I get into the castle """
"[51:20] me010 | OK ,"
[51:20] me003 | Right .
"[51:24] me010 | Or , you know , "" what is there in the castle "" or so there 's all sorts of things you might ask"
[51:29] me010 | that involve the castle as a container
"[51:32] me010 | and you 'd like to have this orthogonal so that anytime the castle 's referred to as a container ,"
[51:36] me010 | you crank up the appropriate stuff .
[51:39] me003 | Right .
"[51:40] me010 | Independent of what the goal is , and independent of what the surrounding language is ."
[51:42] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[51:48] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[51:50] mn015 | It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs
[51:58] mn015 | for these kinds of analysis .
[52:01] mn015 | But uh .
"[52:03] mn015 | Yeah , but they 're they 're easier for parsers . Parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs ,"
[52:06] me010 | Right .
[52:12] mn015 | mean the semantics are very complex in that .
[52:14] me010 | Right .
"[52:16] mn015 | OK , yeah ?"
[52:22] mn015 | No .
"[52:23] mn015 | Oh yeah , b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever , so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem ,"
"[52:38] mn015 | that generalize over those problems , and are"
"[52:41] mn015 | oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um"
"[52:46] mn015 | belief - net , or"
"[52:48] mn015 | "" X "" that we may use for the decision making ,"
[52:52] mn015 | ultimately .
"[52:54] mn015 | Should be decoupled , yeah ."
[53:02] mn015 | OK .
[53:03] me010 | Right .
"[53:04] me010 | So , are we gonna be meeting here from now on ? I 'm I 'm happy to do that . We we had talked about it , cuz you have th th the display and everything , that seems fine ."
[53:17] me010 | Right .
[53:22] me010 | I think it 's worth it
[53:23] me010 | to ass to meet here
"[53:25] me010 | to bring this , and assume that something may come up that we wanna look at ."
[53:28] mn015 | Yeah .
[53:29] me010 | I mean . Why not .
[53:32] mn015 | And um .
[53:48] me010 | She was good . Litonya was good .
"[53:53] mn015 | Yeah ? The uh um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses"
[54:00] me010 | Right .
[54:01] mn015 | and um
[54:08] me010 | Right .
"[54:09] me010 | Yeah , and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff l No , it was great ."
[54:14] mn015 | Yeah .
[54:15] me010 | Yeah .
"[54:15] mn015 | So I think that um I mean , w Looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem ,"
"[54:24] mn015 | for example , is , you know ,"
"[54:26] mn015 | she actually m said you know ,"
"[54:28] mn015 | she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff ."
"[54:37] me012 | Yeah , right ."
"[54:38] mn015 | Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti ,"
"[54:43] mn015 | also , of course , not in the sentence "" How do you get there ? "" was pretty standard ."
"[54:47] mn015 | except that there was a nice anaphora ,"
"[54:49] mn015 | you know ,"
"[54:49] mn015 | for pointing at what she talked about before , and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls , so"
[54:58] me012 | Right .
"[54:58] mn015 | Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge . This would have been a classical um uh "" Tango "" , actually . Um ,"
[55:04] me012 | Yeah .
"[55:04] mn015 | because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside , but"
[55:08] mn015 | OK .
[55:12] me012 | Yep .
[55:17] me010 | Click ?
[55:21] me010 | Alright .

[00:10] fe004 | Why ?
[00:11] fn050 | Um .
"[00:12] fe004 | No , cuz she already told me it , before she told you ."
"[00:14] me003 | No , she told me a long time ago . She told me she told me like two weeks ago ."
"[00:16] fe004 | Oh , well , it doesn't matter what time ."
[00:20] fn050 | Wow .
[00:20] fe004 | Well maybe she hadn't just started transcribing me yet .
[00:23] fe004 | Anyway .
[00:23] fn050 | What is it ?
[00:24] me003 | Let me explain something to you .
"[00:25] fn050 | Um ,"
[00:28] fe004 | I beg to differ .
"[00:30] fn050 | Um , OK ."
[00:31] me003 | Yeah .
[00:34] fn050 | The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page . Here .
[00:35] me003 | No .
[00:36] me003 | @ @ You should be at least be self - satisfied enough to laugh at your own jokes .
[00:41] fn050 | There .
"[00:41] fe004 | No , it 's a different laugh ."
[00:43] fn050 | How weird .
"[00:44] fe004 | Ooh , wow !"
[00:44] me003 | Oh ! Holy mackerel .
[00:49] fn050 | OK . I
[00:51] fn050 | wasn't even doing anything . OK .
"[00:52] me003 | Eva 's got a laptop , she 's trying to show it off ."
[00:56] fn050 | That was r actually Robert 's idea . But anyhow .
[01:00] fn050 | Um
"[01:05] me010 | O K . So , here we are ."
[01:06] me003 | Once again .
"[01:07] me010 | Once again , right , together ."
"[01:08] me010 | Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while , and and"
"[01:13] me010 | probably won't have one next week , I think a number of people are gone ."
"[01:16] me010 | Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on"
[01:20] me010 | where we are with EDU ?
"[01:33] mn015 | So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over ,"
"[01:39] mn015 | and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data , and"
[01:45] mn015 | ten dialogues have been transcribed and can be looked at . If you 're interested in
"[01:51] mn015 | that , talk to me ."
"[01:53] mn015 | Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us ."
[02:00] mn015 | Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more
"[02:02] mn015 | complicated for the subjects , uh this round ."
[02:06] mn015 | She 's actually suggested to
"[02:08] mn015 | look um , at the psychology department students , because they have to partake in two experiments in order to"
[02:16] mn015 | fulfill some requirements .
"[02:19] mn015 | So they have to be subjected , before they can actually graduate ."
"[02:24] mn015 | And um ,"
"[02:26] mn015 | we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time ,"
"[02:31] mn015 | two days , for example ,"
"[02:33] mn015 | to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time , and ,"
"[02:38] mn015 | um ,"
[02:39] mn015 | sort of package the whole thing in a in a re in a few more complicated
"[02:44] mn015 | um , structure ."
"[02:46] mn015 | That 's for the data collection . As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis , which"
[02:56] mn015 | as of this morning should be resolved .
[02:59] me010 | Good .
"[02:59] mn015 | And , so ,"
"[03:02] mn015 | "" should be "" means they aren't yet , but but I think I have the info now that I need ."
"[03:07] mn015 | Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow , so"
"[03:10] mn015 | maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over ,"
[03:15] mn015 | we 're done . And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again
"[03:20] mn015 | Maybe it 'll take some more time ,"
[03:27] mn015 | That was that .
[03:34] mn015 | uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism that 'll be done officially s once we 're done .
"[03:43] mn015 | something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna"
"[03:48] mn015 | look at today , and um ,"
"[03:51] mn015 | we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University . Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy ."
[03:56] fe004 | Sorry . Hi . Hi .
[03:58] mn015 | Hi . Hi .
"[03:59] fe004 | So when you said "" Andreas "" I thought you were talking about Stolcke ."
"[04:03] fe004 | Now I know that we aren't , OK ."
[04:06] mn059 | Yeah .
[04:09] fe004 | Hmm .
[04:13] mn059 | Yeah .
"[04:13] mn015 | Oh , OK ."
"[04:15] mn015 | So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University ,"
[04:21] mn015 | one of his many occupations that
[04:24] mn015 | just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied .
"[04:27] mn015 | And , um ,"
"[04:31] mn015 | um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing , and"
"[04:35] mn015 | why it is s somewhat related , and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using ."
[04:42] mn015 | And um . Was that enough of an update ?
[04:45] me010 | I think so .
[04:50] mn015 | In what order shall we proceed ?
[04:51] fn050 | OK .
"[04:54] fn050 | Uh ,"
"[04:55] fn050 | yeah , sure ."
"[04:56] fn050 | Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um ,"
"[05:03] fn050 | OK . Um ,"
"[05:05] fn050 | I 've been looking at the PRM stuff . Um ,"
"[05:08] fn050 | so , this is , sort of like the latest"
"[05:11] fn050 | thing I have on it , and"
"[05:19] fn050 | and you know , a time , a route , and then and a query class ."
[05:22] fn050 | And I
"[05:24] fn050 | tried to simplify it down a little bit , so that I can actually"
"[05:27] fn050 | um , look at it more . It 's the same paper that"
"[05:30] fn050 | I gave to Jerry last time . Um ,"
"[05:33] fn050 | so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes ,"
[05:37] fn050 | and then
"[05:38] fn050 | tried to The red lines on the ,"
"[05:41] fn050 | um , graph are the um ,"
[05:43] fn050 | relations between the different
"[05:46] fn050 | um ,"
"[05:47] fn050 | classes . Like , a user"
"[05:50] fn050 | has like , a query ,"
"[05:52] fn050 | and then , also has , you know"
"[05:54] fn050 | um , reference slots to its preferences , um , the special needs and , you know , money , and"
[06:02] fn050 | the user interest .
"[06:07] fn050 | this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with"
[06:10] fn050 | the input nodes and all that .
"[06:14] fn050 | So I tried to construct the dependency models , and"
"[06:19] fn050 | a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net , and what they depend on ,"
"[06:22] fn050 | and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that , so I tried to see"
"[06:27] fn050 | how I can do , um put in the computational nodes in between ."
[06:31] fn050 | And what that would
[06:32] fn050 | look like in a PRM .
[06:35] fn050 | And so I ended up
"[06:40] fn050 | Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that"
"[06:45] fn050 | are the intermediate nodes , and one of them is like , time affordability"
"[06:49] fn050 | money affordability , site availability , and"
[06:53] fn050 | the travel compatibility .
"[06:59] fn050 | s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user , or s f just from , I don't know , like the site ."
"[07:06] fn050 | S like ,"
"[07:08] fn050 | um , these here , it 's only like ,"
"[07:11] fn050 | user , but , if you look at travel compatibility"
"[07:15] fn050 | for each of these factors ,"
"[07:17] fn050 | you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the"
"[07:20] fn050 | um , preference of the user is"
"[07:23] fn050 | versus , you know , what type of an event it is , or"
"[07:27] fn050 | you know ,"
[07:28] fn050 | which form of transportation the user has
"[07:31] fn050 | and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case ."
[07:36] fn050 | And
"[07:38] fn050 | that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um ,"
[07:43] fn050 | then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites
[07:48] fn050 | in in mind .
[07:50] fn050 | And so
[07:52] fn050 | for each of the site you 'll come up with this
"[07:54] fn050 | rating , of travel compatibility ."
[08:03] fn050 | I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see
[08:05] fn050 | whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that .
"[08:10] fn050 | And so ,"
[08:13] fn050 | I guess you end up having
"[08:19] fn050 | c well ,"
"[08:21] fn050 | it 's probably the same . But um ,"
[08:30] fn050 | be able to
"[08:31] fn050 | re - use , like , um ,"
"[08:43] fn050 | you can , you know , save some work on that ."
"[08:46] fn050 | But ,"
"[08:47] fn050 | you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then"
[08:53] fn050 | I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how
"[08:56] fn050 | um , using the PRM will help ."
"[08:59] fn050 | Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then ,"
[09:03] fn050 | this this would be the class that
[09:06] fn050 | represent the intermediate nodes .
"[09:09] fn050 | And that would basically it 's just another class in the model ,"
"[09:12] fn050 | with , you know , references to the user and the site and"
[09:16] fn050 | the time .
[09:22] fn050 | of the queries would be
"[09:26] fn050 | reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all ."
"[09:33] fn050 | Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone"
[09:37] fn050 | on the PRM stuff .
[09:39] fn050 | Right .
[09:42] me010 | So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is .
[09:46] fn050 | The output .
[09:47] me010 | So what decisions does this make ?
"[09:49] fn050 | OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model ."
[09:53] fn050 | And one is
[09:55] fn050 | basically how desirable a site is
"[09:58] fn050 | meaning , um ,"
[10:00] fn050 | how good it matches the needs of a user . And the other is the mode
"[10:08] fn050 | Um ,"
"[10:09] fn050 | so , instead of um ,"
"[10:20] fn050 | well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites ."
"[10:23] fn050 | And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits , and basically a rating of how well it fits and"
[10:29] fn050 | what to do with it .
[10:34] fn050 | Anything else I missed ?
[10:37] me010 | So that was pretty quick . She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it that
"[10:42] me010 | uh , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them . Um ,"
[10:55] me010 | You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .
"[11:00] me010 | OK . So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is"
[11:03] fn050 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:04] me010 | uh , we aren't gonna build our own"
"[11:07] me010 | interpreter , so if if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears ."
"[11:14] me010 | Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down ."
"[11:18] me010 | Uh ,"
"[11:20] me010 | the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one ,"
"[11:24] me010 | but ,"
"[11:25] me010 | um , we 'll see . So w Anyway . So that 's"
[11:30] me010 | a a major open issue .
[11:32] me010 | If there is
"[11:34] me010 | an interpreter , it looks like"
"[11:36] me010 | you know , what Eva 's got should run and we should be able to actually"
"[11:41] me010 | um , try to solve , you know , the problems , to actually take the data , and do it ."
"[11:45] me010 | Uh , and we 'll see . Uh , I actually think it is"
"[11:49] me010 | cleaner , and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um ,"
"[11:58] me010 | will help in the expression . Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know . Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't ."
[12:07] fn050 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:07] me010 | You know , it 's the same kind of information . I think there are things that you can express"
"[12:11] me010 | this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net ,"
"[12:15] me010 | uh , without going to some incredible hacking of sort of rebuilding it on the fly . I mean , the notion of instantiating"
[12:23] me010 | your el elements from
[12:26] me010 | the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into
[12:31] me010 | the extended belief - net . So that was one of the main reasons for doing it .
[12:35] me010 | Um .
"[12:42] me010 | I don't know . So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert"
[12:50] me010 | Eva were able to come up with
"[12:55] me010 | you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing ,"
[13:01] me010 | that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .
[13:09] me010 | and then plan a route .
"[13:12] mn015 | Um - hmm , um , well , first of all uh ,"
"[13:15] mn015 | uh , great looks ,"
"[13:16] mn015 | mu much cleaner , nnn , nnn ,"
"[13:18] mn015 | Certain certain beauty in it , so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape ."
"[13:24] mn015 | But ,"
"[13:25] mn015 | the um ,"
[13:32] fn050 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:35] mn015 | because , um , i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ?"
[13:40] fn050 | Yeah .
"[13:51] mn015 | have they changed ,"
[13:52] mn015 | in a sense ?
[13:53] fn050 | Well I think I basically leave them to similar things .
[13:56] mn015 | Uh - huh .
[14:03] fn050 | are that the hours for the site .
"[14:05] fn050 | And ,"
[14:07] fn050 | eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not .
"[14:12] fn050 | And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction , and and or"
"[14:18] mn015 | And the , uh ,"
[14:18] fn050 | stuff like that .
"[14:19] mn015 | other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it ,"
[14:25] mn015 | you can put
[14:26] mn015 | the probabilities also on the relations .
[14:31] fn050 | Which is the structural uncertainty ?
[14:34] me010 | Yeah .
"[14:41] me010 | the Ubenth stuff . I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not ,"
[14:43] fe004 | Mmm .
"[14:46] me010 | uh , structural uncertainty ."
[14:48] mn015 | It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM is that
[14:53] me010 | OK .
"[14:53] mn015 | classes and relations , and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations ."
[15:00] me010 | Alright .
"[15:02] me010 | Uh ,"
"[15:04] fn050 | I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure , but I don't remember reading how you specify"
[15:04] mn015 | I should say .
[15:07] me010 | Yeah .
[15:11] me010 | Right .
[15:11] fn050 | wh to start with . Yeah . Yeah .
[15:13] me010 | Yeah .
"[15:14] me010 | So , uh , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back ,"
"[15:17] me010 | we 'll get in touch and supposedly ,"
"[15:20] me010 | um ,"
[15:22] me010 | we 'll actually
[15:24] me010 | get s deep seriously connected to to their work and
[15:28] mn015 | Yep .
"[15:28] me010 | somebody 'll Uh , you know If it 's a"
"[15:30] me010 | group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever ."
"[15:33] me010 | So , we 'll actually figure all this out ."
[15:36] mn015 | OK .
[15:44] mn015 | OK .
[15:46] mn015 | Then
[15:47] mn015 | I think the w long term perspective is is pretty clear .
[15:52] mn015 | We get
"[15:53] mn015 | rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package , if , when , and how , then"
[15:59] fn050 | Mm - hmm .
[16:00] mn015 | this becomes
[16:02] mn015 | foregrounded
"[16:04] mn015 | profiled , focused , again ."
[16:08] me003 | Designated ?
"[16:10] mn015 | And um ,"
[16:19] mn015 | that 's way more complicated for you .
[16:22] fn050 | OK .
"[16:23] mn015 | Because this was laughingly easy , right ?"
[16:26] fn050 | Actually I had to
"[16:28] fn050 | take out a lot of the complicated stuff , cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning , and"
"[16:33] fn050 | Jerry was like , "" this is just too much "" ."
"[16:37] me010 | Yeah . So , um ,"
"[16:39] me010 | you could ,"
"[16:41] me010 | from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together"
"[16:45] me010 | and you wanted to plan something that somehow ,"
[16:48] me010 | with some Pareto optimal
"[16:56] fe004 | Except for humans can't really solve it either , so ."
[17:02] fe004 | Yeah .
[17:06] fe004 | And then you can blame the computer . So .
[17:07] me010 | w Exactly .
[17:07] mn015 | Hmm .
[17:18] me003 | That 'd be nice .
[17:19] fe004 | Mmm .
"[17:20] me010 | So . So there i there are some some u uh , you know ,"
"[17:23] me010 | uh , elaborations of this"
[17:26] me010 | that
[17:27] me010 | you could try to put in
"[17:29] me010 | to this structure , but I don't think it 's worth it now ."
[17:35] me010 | what else we 're gonna do .
"[17:38] me010 | Anyway . But uh ,"
"[17:41] me010 | it 's good , yeah and and"
[17:42] me010 | there were a couple other ideas of of
"[17:44] me010 | uh , things for Eva to look at"
[17:49] me010 | in in the interim .
[17:56] mn015 | see what Andreas has got out his sleeve .
"[17:59] mn015 | Or Andy , for that matter ?"
[18:01] mn059 | OK .
"[18:14] mn059 | that 's relevant to you uh , a at the moment , uh , the the reason is really for me"
"[18:19] mn059 | uh , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field . And and so I 'll just n sort of give you a real quick introduction to what I 'm working on , and"
"[18:27] mn059 | um , I just hope that you have some comments or , maybe you 're interested in it to find out more , and and so I 'll be uh , happy to talk to you and and uh , I 'd also like to find out some more and and maybe I 'll just walk around the office and"
"[18:41] mn059 | and then and ask some some questions , uh , in a couple days . So I 'll be here for uh , tomorrow and then uh , the remainder of uh , next week ."
"[18:48] mn059 | OK , so , um , what I started looking at , uh , to begin with is just uh , content management systems uh , i i in general . So"
"[18:56] mn059 | um , uh what 's uh Sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects ,"
"[19:05] mn059 | um , and you store meta - data uh , associate to them . So there 's some international standards like the I - triple - E , uh There 's an I - triple - E , LON standard ,"
"[19:14] mn059 | and um , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have uh author information , you have uh , size information , format information and so on ."
"[19:21] mn059 | Uh , but they 're two uh fields that are um , more interesting . One is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document , and one is uh , you have sort of a , um ,"
"[19:31] mn059 | well , what is the document about ? So it 's some sort of taxonomic"
"[19:35] mn059 | uh , ordering of of the of the units . Now ,"
[19:39] mn059 | if you sort of put on your
"[19:41] mn059 | semantic glasses ,"
"[19:43] mn059 | uh you say , well that 's not all that easy , because there 's an implicit um , uh , assumption behind that is that uh , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of"
"[19:56] mn059 | uh , whichever taxonomy is used , and uh ,"
[19:59] mn059 | I think that 's a that 's a very that 's a key point of these systems and they sort of always
[20:04] mn059 | brush over this real quickly without
"[20:06] mn059 | really elaborating much of that and uh As a matter of fact , the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes , which are very , very coarse grain , so you have some like ,"
"[20:16] mn059 | science , biology , and then But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge ,"
"[20:23] mn059 | um , uh need for improvement there ."
"[20:36] mn059 | Um , so what I 'm what I try to do is um ,"
"[20:39] mn059 | to have um , uh So . So the scenario is the following , you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem . Now ,"
"[20:45] mn059 | what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh , students um , try to u"
"[20:51] mn059 | program a certain assignment , for example , they always run into the same"
"[20:54] mn059 | problems ,"
"[20:55] mn059 | uh , and they always come running to us , and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working , and we always give out the same answer , so we thought , well , it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this , and"
"[21:03] mn059 | so , what I want to build is basically a a smart F A Q system ."
"[21:08] mn059 | Now , what you"
"[21:10] mn059 | uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than "" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . "" So ."
"[21:17] mn059 | And I think that I don't need to tell you this . I 'm I 'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain ,"
"[21:23] mn059 | uh , context it , and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference . So ,"
"[21:28] mn059 | I want to be able to model information like , um , so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems , of a at a computer science school , um ,"
"[21:39] mn059 | what kind of software is the person using , which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment ,"
"[21:43] mn059 | um , maybe what 's the background of that student 's um , which um , which error message was encountered ."
"[21:50] mn059 | So this sort of information I think should be transmitted , uh , when a certain document is retrieved ."
"[21:56] mn059 | Now ,"
"[21:57] mn059 | um ,"
"[21:58] mn059 | basically giving this um Uh so we somehow need to have a formalized um , way of writing this down basically ,"
[22:05] mn059 | and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again .
"[22:10] mn059 | And ,"
"[22:24] mn059 | are written in Java . So some some inferences like that , now ,"
"[22:27] mn059 | um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against ."
"[22:41] mn059 | given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match ,"
[22:45] mn059 | and use this as a metric in the search .
"[22:53] mn059 | uh try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach ."
"[23:01] mn059 | So if I knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ? And and having uh , uh a symbolic formalized model of this I could simply compute that ,"
"[23:14] mn059 | which questions are worth um , asking ."
"[23:17] mn059 | And that 's what I then propagate back to the user , and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way ."
"[23:23] mn059 | Now , the big"
"[23:25] mn059 | problem that I 'm facing right now is um ,"
"[23:27] mn059 | it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability ."
"[23:34] mn059 | And uh uh , so Robert was mentioning uh , earlier today is that uh , Microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a Bayesian network ,"
"[23:42] mn059 | which does exactly this , but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend ."
"[23:46] mn059 | And so , uh what I 'm What I try to do is basically try to model this uh , in a way that you could really combine"
"[23:53] mn059 | uh , knowledge from very different sources , and and um , sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh , came up with ."
"[24:02] mn059 | Trying to to have uh , an approach how to integrate s uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules ,"
"[24:12] mn059 | um , what you can do with those ."
[24:14] mn059 | Um .
"[24:16] mn059 | What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic"
"[24:25] mn059 | uh , computational model . That that probably isn't expressive enough . So . So that 's another thing ,"
"[24:30] mn059 | um , which I think you 're also uh , uh looking into right now ."
"[24:35] mn059 | And then um , uh sort of as an add - on to this whole idea , um , uh that would be"
"[24:46] mn059 | um , uh , which uh , rules and which ontologies it it uses , or basically its view of the world ,"
[24:52] mn059 | uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines .
"[24:58] mn059 | And there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach , where"
"[25:03] mn059 | we 're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves ,"
"[25:14] mn059 | rather than going to some Yahoo - like uh , search engine ."
"[25:18] mn059 | So these are some of the just in a nutshell , some of the"
"[25:24] mn059 | even though it 's a it 's a very different domain , but I think a lot of the , um , issues are are fairly similar . So ."
[25:33] mn059 | OK .
"[25:44] mn059 | Uh I know , yeah I know abou about it ."
[25:45] fe004 | So it seems like a lot of some of the issues are
"[25:48] fe004 | the same . It 's like , um ,"
"[25:50] fe004 | you know , the c context - based factors that influence how you interpret ,"
[25:53] mn059 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[25:54] fe004 | um , s"
"[25:55] fe004 | how to interpret . In in this case , infer in in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask . We - we 've kind of talked about that , but we haven't"
[26:02] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[26:02] fe004 | worried too much about that end of the discourse . But maybe you guys had that in the previous
"[26:05] mn015 | Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that"
[26:07] fe004 | models .
"[26:11] mn015 | he doesn't have to come up with an answer , but he wants to point to the places w w"
"[26:15] mn059 | Yeah , so . So I 'm I 'm not I 'm not building an expert Uh , I want to build a smart librarian , basically that can point you to the right reference . I don't wanna compute the answer ,"
[26:18] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Right .
[26:20] fe004 | Right .
[26:23] mn059 | so it 's a little bit easier for me .
"[26:27] mn015 | understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to"
[26:30] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[26:32] mn059 | Mm - hmm .
[26:32] fe004 | So you also don't have to figure out what the content is . You 're just taking the keywords as a topic
[26:38] mn059 | I I assume that that the there will be learning systems that that tag their their content .
[26:42] fe004 | OK .
"[26:43] mn059 | And um , um ,"
[26:43] fe004 | Right .
[26:46] mn059 | m @ @ and basically what I what I envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an FAQ for example you could state
"[26:53] mn059 | sort of like a logic condition , when this document applies . So "" this document"
"[26:57] mn059 | explains how to set up your uh , mail account on Linux "" or"
[27:03] mn059 | something like this .
[27:03] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:09] mn059 | But the I think that the key point with these uh , learning systems is that uh , a learning system"
[27:14] mn059 | is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries . You can have the best learning system with the best
"[27:18] fe004 | Mmm , mm - hmm ."
"[27:21] mn059 | search interface , if there 's no content inside of it ,"
[27:23] mn059 | it 's not very useful . So I think ultimately because
"[27:27] mn059 | um , uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences I think is very costly , so"
[27:37] mn059 | some existing
"[27:39] mn059 | um , domain domain information , or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote and then try to integrate them , and then also search the entire web basically , rather than just the small"
"[27:50] mn059 | uh , content management system ."
[27:53] fe004 | OK . Mm - hmm .
[28:04] fe004 | I guess I 'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things
[28:07] mn059 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:08] fe004 | that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups , cuz"
"[28:10] fe004 | some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses , and"
[28:14] fe004 | I 'm guessing that you you won't be doing that ?
[28:17] mn059 | No .
"[28:17] fe004 | OK . Just checking . So , OK ."
"[28:24] me010 | On the other hand ,"
"[28:26] me010 | uh ,"
[28:27] me010 | FrameNet
[28:28] me010 | could well be useful . So do you know the FrameNet story ?
"[28:31] mn059 | Um , yeah . Uh , not not too much , but uh ,"
[28:33] me010 | OK .
[28:35] me010 | Oh . Th - that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here .
[28:35] mn059 | I have a rough overview .
"[28:38] me010 | Because , um ,"
"[28:40] me010 | you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may"
[28:45] me010 | well give you additional keywords or
"[28:48] me010 | uh , if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh ,"
"[28:55] me010 | indicate a frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather th than just"
[29:00] mn059 | Mmm . Mmm .
"[29:00] me010 | uh , individual So there 's a lot of stuff , and people are looking at that . Most of the work here"
[29:05] me010 | is just trying to get the frames right . There 's linguists and stuff and there 's a lot of it and they 're they 're busily working away .
[29:12] me010 | But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it .
[29:17] me010 | And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where
[29:20] mn059 | Yeah . Yeah .
[29:21] me010 | you might be able to do that .
"[29:22] mn059 | Yeah . I 'm sure I could learn a lot about um ,"
[29:23] fe004 | Mmm .
"[29:24] mn059 | yeah , just how to how to come up with these structures , cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly , but it"
"[29:36] mn059 | well , they must be well designed really ."
"[29:39] mn015 | Remember the uh , Prashant story ?"
[29:42] me010 | Right .
[29:43] mn015 | The absolutely no no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here .
[29:47] me010 | Right .
[29:48] mn015 | And Andreas and I
"[29:50] mn015 | tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would"
[29:56] me010 | Right .
"[29:58] mn015 | p do some of the work for this machine ,"
[30:00] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:03] me010 | W yeah , I know , I mean it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him . I think uh ,"
[30:08] mn015 | Absolutely . Yeah .
"[30:09] mn015 | But so I 'm just saying , the uh , we had that idea"
[30:11] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:12] me010 | The idea was there . Yeah , OK ."
[30:13] mn015 | uh to to exploit FrameNet
[30:14] fe004 | Hmm .
[30:16] mn015 | there as well .
"[30:23] mn015 | And Srini 's doing information extraction also , right ? with that FrameNet base . Mm - hmm ."
[30:25] me010 | Right . Yeah .
[30:26] mn059 | Mmm .
[30:27] me010 | So you you guys never sent anybody else from I U .
[30:31] mn059 | Except except Prashant ?
[30:32] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:34] me010 | Uh , this was supposedly an exchange program , and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care , but it just I 'm a little surprised that"
[30:37] mn059 | @ @
"[30:40] me010 | uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send ."
[30:41] mn059 | @ @
[30:43] mn059 | @ @
"[30:45] me010 | Alright . I mean I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program ."
[30:45] fe004 | Hmm .
[30:50] mn015 | Uh it 's in the program ?
"[30:51] mn059 | Uh I I think it 's it 's really the lack of students uh , at IU at the moment ."
[30:52] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:53] me010 | Yeah . No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed . It was Yeah ."
"[30:58] mn059 | Yeah , yeah . I think it 's ju it 's more the lack of of students ,"
"[31:03] me010 | Yeah , I know ."
[31:03] fe004 | Mmm .
[31:06] me010 | Right .
[31:07] me010 | Right .
"[31:08] mn059 | Well I mean if if I were a student , I 'd love to come here , rather than"
[31:11] me010 | Yeah .
[31:14] me010 | Right .
[31:25] me010 | Right . Anyway .
[31:28] me010 | Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here .
"[31:33] me010 | Uh , unfortunately ,"
"[31:37] me010 | Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff"
[31:43] me010 | is himself out of town .
[31:44] mn059 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:45] mn059 | Well I 'll go to the uh , Semantic Web Workshop , uh ,"
[31:49] mn059 | in two weeks .
[31:50] fe004 | @ @
"[31:50] me010 | Yeah , for for some reason he 's not doing that ."
[31:53] fe004 | Yeah .
"[31:54] me010 | I don't know why he @ @ oh , I , who knows ? Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there ."
"[31:54] fe004 | Well , he had other things to do ."
[31:58] fe004 | The other person I thought of is Dan Gildea ? because he did some work on topic
[32:01] me010 | Yeah .
[32:03] me010 | St - statistical stuff . That would be a very good idea .
[32:03] fe004 | spotting
"[32:05] fe004 | w um ,"
[32:05] mn059 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:06] fe004 | which is , I mean , you I mean . I don't Depending on how well you wanna integrate with that end , you know , like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that"
"[32:16] fe004 | has worked on that kinda stuff , and he 's worked with frame net , so you could talk to him about , you know , both of those things at once . So ."
[32:18] mn059 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[32:21] fe004 | And he just finished writing a draft of his thesis . So .
"[32:24] mn059 | So , uh , who is that again ?"
"[32:24] fe004 | I u Dan Gildea , GILDEA ."
[32:28] mn015 | Who ?
[32:29] mn015 | I can take you to his office . It 's just around the corner .
"[32:31] mn059 | OK , great ."
[32:38] fe004 | Hmm .
"[32:46] me010 | Alright , was there anything else for this ?"
[32:51] me010 | One of these times soon
[32:54] me010 | we 're gonna hear about construal .
"[33:06] mn015 | Um ,"
[33:08] me003 | Wait a second . That 's a long way away .
"[33:13] mn015 | Uh well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this . So ."
"[33:25] me010 | Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes ."
[33:27] fe004 | At least this is a private meeting .
"[33:29] fe004 | Right , exactly , OK , that 's the link ."
"[33:32] mn015 | Oh , they refused the budget again ? Is it so about CITRIS ? Yeah , still nothing ."
"[33:38] me010 | Uh , this this this t the s we 're , uh , involved in a"
[33:44] me010 | literally three hundred million dollar
"[33:47] me010 | uh , program ."
"[33:49] me010 | Uh , with the State of California . And , the State of California is now"
[33:54] me010 | a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget .
[34:01] me010 | So the budget has not been approved .
"[34:05] me010 | There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it ,"
[34:09] mn059 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:10] me010 | and , um ,"
"[34:19] me010 | who approved it got flak from there , eh anyway . So ,"
"[34:25] me010 | Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this , OK ?"
"[34:28] me010 | And then we 'll go . So , I it turns out I wound up having lunch today"
[34:33] me010 | with a guy named Tom Kalil .
"[34:41] me010 | And , uh , he now"
[34:44] me010 | works at
[34:45] me010 | Berkeley . In fact he 's hired to
"[34:51] me010 | So they 've been hiring people right and left , so ,"
"[34:54] me010 | uh , they think the money 's coming . So and he was , I think ,"
[35:00] me010 | the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters .
"[35:05] me010 | He was in the White House , I don't remember what he was saying . A anyway , like that ."
"[35:08] me010 | And , is now"
"[35:10] me010 | doing all the politics for CITRIS , but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in"
"[35:17] me010 | uh , actually doing things for society , so digital divide and stuff like that . So that 's"
"[35:24] me010 | s interesting to me but maybe not to you . But the really interesting thing was ,"
"[35:28] me010 | he st he s he s said something about ,"
"[35:31] me010 | you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier , something that is of great social value . He said ,"
"[35:38] me010 | "" for example "" ,"
"[35:41] me010 | "" if you had a"
"[35:44] me010 | adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor ,"
"[35:48] me010 | and as compelling as a video game ,"
"[35:51] me010 | then that would have a huge social impact "" ."
"[35:56] me010 | I said , "" Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . "" Anyway . So it was nice that"
"[36:00] me010 | uh ,"
"[36:02] me010 | he 's got this view ,"
"[36:04] me010 | of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B ,"
"[36:07] me010 | uh , language would be a good way to do it ."
[36:10] fe004 | Mmm . Definitely .
"[36:13] me010 | So anyway , that 's the end of the story ."
[36:16] fe004 | But for adults and not for the
"[36:18] me010 | This was Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing , but , uh ,"
[36:19] fe004 | children . Uh - huh .
"[36:23] me010 | you know , a again , if if you if you"
[36:24] fe004 | Oh .
"[36:26] me010 | um ,"
"[36:29] me010 | and this was this was literacy , which actually is somewhat different problem . Maybe easier . I don't know ."
[36:32] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:38] me010 | Another project we started on , and and didn't get funded for was ,"
"[36:41] me010 | uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program ,"
[36:46] me010 | for kids
[36:48] me010 | whose first language wasn't English .
[36:51] me010 | Which is like half the school population in California .
"[36:54] me010 | Something like that , isn't it ?"
[36:55] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:56] me010 | Yeah . So ,"
[36:58] me010 | enormous
"[36:59] me010 | problem in California ,"
"[37:01] me010 | and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build"
[37:10] me010 | be tutors for the kids .
[37:11] me010 | We think we could .
[37:15] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:17] me010 | um ,"
[37:22] me010 | it 's interesting and I may
"[37:24] me010 | um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that ."
"[37:31] me010 | So anyway , that was that was today 's little story ."
[37:33] me003 | Hmm .
[37:36] mn015 | OK . So I I did manage to
"[37:38] mn015 | get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS , but uh or a temporarily putting it out of the sling but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that"
"[37:42] me010 | No , no ."
[37:46] me010 | Right .
[37:51] mn015 | I am
"[37:53] mn015 | n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,"
[37:59] me010 | Yeah .
"[38:00] mn015 | and also revising ,"
[38:04] mn015 | the c the original construal proposal .
"[38:07] mn015 | And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I I can"
[38:13] mn015 | potentially present once you get back .
[38:14] fe004 | Greater than two ?
[38:20] me010 | Right .
[38:21] me010 | Right .
[38:27] me010 | it 's
"[38:28] me010 | time again , right ?"
"[38:30] mn015 | Absolutely . Yeah . But um , and hopefully all sidetracking"
[38:30] me010 | Yeah . OK .
"[38:34] mn015 | um , other"
"[38:36] mn015 | things will have disappeared , soon ."
[38:38] me010 | Good . Yep .
[38:41] me010 | Done ?

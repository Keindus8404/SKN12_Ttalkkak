[00:01] me013 | Alright .
[00:07] me013 | So .
[00:08] me011 | Are we going ?
"[00:09] me013 | It is uh , must be February fifteenth ."
[00:12] fe008 | Yeah .
[00:13] me011 | Yu -
[00:18] me013 | Yeah .
[00:23] me013 | Yeah . We didn't have a front - end meeting today .
"[00:30] me011 | And let 's remember also to make sure that one 's gets marked as unread , unused ."
[00:31] me013 | OK .
[00:36] mn014 | MR eleven .
[00:36] me011 | MR eleven .
[00:40] me013 | Mmm .
[00:45] me013 | OK . So .
[00:47] me011 | There 's lots of clicking I 'm sure as I 'm trying to get this to work correctly .
[00:50] me013 | Agenda .
[00:51] me013 | Any agenda items today ?
"[00:56] me011 | how we 're gonna to get people to edit bleeps ,"
[00:59] me011 | parts of the meeting that they don't want to include .
[01:06] me013 | OK .
"[01:07] fe008 | I wanna ask about um ,"
[01:09] fe008 | some aud audio monitoring
[01:11] fe008 | on some of the um well
[01:14] fe008 | some of the equipment .
"[01:15] fe008 | In particular , the well"
"[01:17] fe008 | uh , that 's just what I wanna ask ."
"[01:18] me013 | OK audio monitoring , Jane ."
[01:19] fe008 | Ba - based on some of the tran uh i
"[01:21] fe008 | In listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things ,"
"[01:27] fe008 | and in pact in fact this one I 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , so I Mm - hmm . Yeah ."
[01:30] me011 | Oh really .
[01:32] mn014 | Spikes ?
[01:33] me011 | Clicks .
[01:34] fe008 | Yeah .
[01:35] me013 | Hmm .
[01:35] fe008 | Yeah .
[01:36] me018 | Huh .
[01:36] fe008 | And I don't know what the e electronics is but .
[01:39] fe008 | Yeah .
"[01:39] me011 | Yeah . Well , I think it 's"
"[01:41] me011 | uh , it it could be a number of things . It could be touching and fiddling , and the other thing is that it could the fact that it 's on a wired mike is suspicious . It might be a connector ."
[01:44] mn014 | Yeah .
"[01:50] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
[01:51] fe008 | Then we don't really have to talk about that as an I I take that off the agenda .
"[01:53] me018 | You could try an experiment and say "" OK , I 'm about to test for spikes "" , and then wiggle the thing there , and then"
[01:58] me011 | Yeah . Right .
[02:05] me013 | Um .
"[02:05] fe008 | Well ,"
[02:08] fe008 | OK .
"[02:09] me013 | I mean ,"
[02:10] me013 | were this a
"[02:11] me013 | professional audio recording ,"
"[02:15] me013 | what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and"
[02:19] me013 | make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance .
"[02:23] me013 | And if they are , then they can't be used ."
[02:25] me011 | Right .
[02:26] me013 | So .
[02:28] me013 | Um . Let 's see . I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on
"[02:34] me013 | uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus ."
[02:40] fe008 | Good .
"[02:41] me013 | And then um ,"
"[02:43] me013 | the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas ."
"[02:49] me013 | So maybe I 'll I 'll start with that actually . Uh ,"
[02:53] me013 | Andreas brought up
"[02:55] me013 | the fact that he would kinda like to know ,"
"[02:57] me013 | if possible , what we were gonna be talking about because"
[03:01] me013 | he 's
"[03:02] me013 | sort of peripherally involved to this point ,"
[03:07] me013 | discussion about something that he
[03:16] me013 | because of uh
[03:18] me013 | the fact that the meetings are are tending to become
"[03:21] me013 | reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so ,"
[03:25] me013 | he figures he could help that out by not showing and and I 'm sure help
[03:27] me011 | Mmm .
[03:28] me013 | out his own time .
[03:35] me013 | I 'd I think that
[03:37] me013 | this is a wish on his part . Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times
"[03:47] me013 | But um ,"
[03:47] me011 | Right .
"[03:48] me013 | we could try anyway , uh ,"
[03:50] me013 | do another try at coming up with the agenda
"[03:53] me013 | uh , at some point before the meeting ,"
"[03:56] me013 | uh , say the day before ."
"[03:56] me011 | Well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on Wednesday , or Tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items ."
[04:05] mn014 | Yeah .
[04:07] me013 | OK .
[04:08] me013 | You you wanna volunteer to do that ?
[04:09] me011 | Sure .
[04:10] me013 | OK .
[04:11] me013 | Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .
[04:14] me013 | Uh .
[04:14] me011 | Let me
[04:15] me011 | I 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done .
"[04:17] me018 | That 'll help a lot , actually ."
"[04:18] me013 | Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting ."
"[04:25] me013 | And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But but But ."
[04:34] me013 | But we can try .
[04:36] me013 | Maybe it 'll work .
[04:37] me018 | Mmm .
[04:38] me013 | Yeah .
[04:39] me011 | Weirder things have happened .
"[04:42] fe008 | I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean ."
[04:48] fe008 | Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .
[04:52] me018 | I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him .
[04:58] me013 | Yeah .
[05:04] me013 | So we 're done with that topic .
[05:05] me013 | The other topic I was thinking of was
"[05:07] me013 | the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that ."
"[05:10] me011 | Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too ."
[05:12] me013 | Yeah .
[05:14] me013 | Why why don't we do that .
"[05:15] me011 | OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in ."
"[05:19] me011 | Um . And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope ."
[05:23] me011 | And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow .
"[05:29] me011 | well , a couple things . First of all ,"
"[05:32] me011 | if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them ."
"[05:37] me011 | So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,"
[05:39] mn014 | Uh -
[05:39] me011 | and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them .
"[05:42] me011 | Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless ."
"[05:47] me011 | Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired ."
[05:54] me013 | So how many channels do you get to have
[05:57] me013 | in a wireless setup ?
"[05:58] me011 | Um ,"
"[05:59] me011 | well ,"
[06:00] me011 | I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless .
"[06:06] me011 | So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike ,"
"[06:10] me011 | possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together ."
[06:14] me011 | And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .
"[06:20] me013 | So , um ."
"[06:23] me011 | So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six ."
[06:26] me011 | Right ? So we could have up to nine .
[06:29] me013 | And right now we can have up to six .
[06:30] me011 | Right .
"[06:31] me011 | And we have five , we 're getting one more ."
[06:33] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:36] me011 | And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station ,"
[06:39] me011 | and then eight hundred per channel .
[06:45] me013 | Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .
[06:48] me011 | Right .
"[06:49] me013 | Oh , we should do it ."
[06:51] me011 | OK .
[06:52] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:52] me011 | OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them ."
[06:54] me013 | Yeah .
[06:59] me018 | So we 're not increasing the number of channels .
"[07:00] me011 | No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working ,"
[07:01] me018 | OK . OK . I see .
"[07:05] me011 | along with a couple of the wired that aren't working ,"
"[07:08] me011 | one of the wired that 's not working ,"
[07:09] me011 | with a wireless .
"[07:11] me018 | Three wireds work , right ?"
"[07:13] me011 | I I guess three wireds work , yeah ."
[07:14] me018 | Yeah . Yeah .
[07:15] me013 | Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that .
[07:18] me011 | Yep .
[07:18] me013 | And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that .
[07:21] me011 | Right .
[07:21] me013 | And so
"[07:23] me013 | um ,"
"[07:24] me013 | we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries ."
[07:31] me013 | That seems to be the key
[07:31] me011 | Right .
[07:32] me011 | Everyone 's battery OK ?
[07:33] me013 | issue .
[07:35] me011 | OK .
[07:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[07:37] me013 | Um ,"
"[07:43] me013 | Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf ."
"[07:55] me011 | Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff ,"
"[08:00] me011 | and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that ."
[08:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[08:04] me018 | SRI , really ?"
[08:05] me011 | Yeah .
[08:05] me018 | Oh .
[08:06] me011 | They got sa apparent
"[08:07] me011 | Well ,"
[08:09] me011 | Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue .
"[08:13] me013 | Uh , I don't know . Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff ."
[08:13] me011 | I don't know how much of it 's public .
[08:16] me011 | Right .
[08:16] me013 | Yeah .
"[08:17] me013 | But anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW . So ."
"[08:25] me013 | Um . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , uh , radio - mikes ."
[08:31] me011 | Right .
"[08:33] me013 | Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector ,"
"[08:39] me013 | which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?"
"[08:42] me011 | Uh , no , we 're having the them do it . So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it ."
[08:42] me013 | No ?
[08:45] me013 | Oh .
[08:47] me013 | OK .
"[08:47] me011 | So , they they charge right ."
[08:51] me011 | You 've never seen my hand - soldering .
"[08:54] me011 | But uh ,"
"[08:55] me013 | Uh ,"
"[08:56] me013 | OK , so that 's being done professionally and Yeah ."
[08:56] me011 | a as I said they 're coming in .
[08:58] me011 | I I mean Yeah . I mean .
[08:59] me013 | Yeah .
[08:59] me011 | As professionally as I guess you can get it done .
"[09:03] me013 | Well ,"
[09:05] me011 | I mean i it 's just their repair shop .
[09:08] me011 | Right ? Their maintenance people .
"[09:10] me013 | Well , we 'll see what it it 's like . That tha that can be quite good ."
[09:11] me011 | Yep .
"[09:13] me013 | Th - this Yeah , OK ."
"[09:17] me013 | Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that . Uh ,"
"[09:19] me011 | And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like ."
[09:21] me013 | Yeah .
"[09:23] me013 | So , um ,"
"[09:25] me013 | uh ,"
[09:26] me013 | Dave isn't here but he was going to
[09:28] me013 | start working on some things with the digits .
"[09:32] me013 | Uh ,"
[09:38] me013 | the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?
[09:43] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[09:43] me013 | Has that started , or is that ?"
"[09:44] fe008 | Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that ."
"[09:49] me011 | Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the all that last week ."
[09:56] me011 | So all the all the forms are now on the computer .
"[10:01] me011 | And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and"
[10:04] me011 | let the uh transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those .
[10:10] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[10:13] fe008 | it w it will be efficient for them to do that .
[10:15] me011 | I I don't think it 'll take too long .
"[10:17] me011 | So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect ."
"[10:21] me013 | So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user"
"[10:25] me013 | for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave ."
[10:27] me011 | Right .
[10:28] me011 | I 've already done five or six sets .
"[10:30] me011 | So if he wanted to , you know , just have a few to start with , he could ."
"[10:35] me011 | You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also ."
[10:40] me013 | Right .
[10:43] me013 | OK .
"[10:46] me013 | I don't know if Dave is on the list ,"
[10:52] fe008 | I don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .
"[10:54] mn014 | No , no ."
"[10:54] me011 | Uh , we don't have a active one but I 'll make sure he 's on the list ."
[10:58] fe008 | Should we call him ? I mean is he d is he definitely not available today ?
[11:01] me013 | I don't know .
[11:02] fe008 | Should I call his office and see ?
[11:03] mn014 | He was in . Yeah .
"[11:03] me011 | I mean , he 's still taking classes , so uh , he may well have conflicts ."
[11:06] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:07] mn014 | Yeah , he was in s"
[11:09] fe008 | He wasn't there at cof
"[11:10] me013 | Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him ."
[11:12] mn014 | Yeah .
[11:12] fe008 | OK .
[11:12] me013 | Yeah .
[11:14] me013 | OK .
"[11:15] me013 | Uh , so ."
[11:20] mn014 | I think he has a class . Yeah .
[11:20] me011 | Tuesdays and Thursdays ?
[11:22] me018 | Yeah . He might have .
"[11:24] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[11:24] mn009 | You talking about David Gelbart ?
"[11:24] me011 | Oh well , whatever ."
[11:25] me013 | Yeah .
[11:25] me018 | Yeah .
[11:25] me011 | Yeah .
[11:25] fe008 | Yes .
[11:26] mn014 | Yeah .
"[11:26] mn009 | Yeah , I think he 's taking two twenty - five A which is now ."
[11:29] me013 | Yeah . OK .
[11:29] fe008 | OK .
[11:29] mn009 | So .
[11:29] me018 | Yeah .
"[11:33] me013 | Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on ."
[11:38] fe008 | OK .
"[11:38] me013 | And the and the recordings also , just where we are ."
[11:41] me013 | Yeah .
"[11:42] fe008 | Well ,"
"[11:42] fe008 | so um , should we we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ?"
"[11:47] me011 | Well , we have about thirty - two hours uh"
"[11:52] me011 | as of ,"
[11:58] me013 | And and that 's that 's uh How much of that is digits ?
"[12:01] me013 | It 's uh that 's including digits , right ?"
[12:03] me011 | That 's including digits . I haven't separated it out so I have no clue how much of that is digits .
[12:06] me013 | Yeah .
[12:12] me011 | Of of non - digits ?
[12:13] mn014 | Mmm .
[12:13] me013 | Of non - digits .
"[12:13] me011 | Yeah , absolutely . I mean , the digits don't take up that much time ."
"[12:14] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:16] me013 | OK .
"[12:22] fe008 | think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . The next step is to that I 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first ,"
"[12:33] fe008 | and then channelized . What I mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that"
"[12:42] fe008 | uh , Liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a"
"[12:48] fe008 | systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which I hadn't been specific about ."
"[12:59] me011 | Nine two , right ."
"[13:04] fe008 | I I mean , a certain number of them did put the words down ,"
"[13:07] fe008 | but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things ."
"[13:12] me018 | You know , Jane ?"
[13:12] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:12] me018 | Um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but"
[13:15] me018 | I 've noticed in the past that when I 've gone
"[13:17] me018 | through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things ,"
[13:26] me018 | a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis
[13:29] me011 | Misspelled .
[13:30] mn014 | Yeah .
"[13:30] fe008 | You 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and I use those too ."
[13:33] fe008 | Y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word right ?
[13:36] fe008 | It 's one token from the from the corpus .
[13:37] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[13:39] fe008 | Yeah , those are e extremely efficient and I and I I agree that 's a very good use of it ."
"[13:41] me018 | Oh so you already have that , OK ."
"[13:42] fe008 | Well that 's that 's a way that 's You know , the spell - check"
"[13:45] fe008 | basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy I wanna do in terms of locating these things which are"
[13:52] fe008 | you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .
"[13:53] me018 | Mm - hmm . Cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other ,"
[13:54] fe008 | Exactly . And then you ca then you can do a s
[13:55] mn014 | Yeah .
"[13:56] me018 | and uh , i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other"
[13:59] fe008 | Absolutely . I agree .
[14:00] me018 | and and so it makes it easier .
"[14:01] fe008 | That 's a very good that 's a very good uh , suggestion ."
"[14:18] fe008 | an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets I 'm gonna put either"
"[14:25] fe008 | "" VOC "" for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever ,"
[14:34] me011 | Right .
[14:37] me018 | Oh that 's great .
"[14:38] fe008 | I haven't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz I think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . That was what I was always planing on . So that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying ,"
"[14:47] fe008 | you get a whole list of things that say "" curly bracket laugh curly bracket "" ,"
[14:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:50] fe008 | then y you know it 's it 's You you risk less error if you handle it by a filter ,"
"[14:55] fe008 | than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a VOC space , so man"
[14:58] me018 | Yeah .
[14:59] fe008 | So many ways that error prone .
[15:00] me018 | Right .
[15:01] me018 | Right .
"[15:01] fe008 | So , um ,"
"[15:10] fe008 | and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset"
"[15:13] fe008 | when you do what you 're saying , you end up with a s with uh , you 're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know I mean , jus"
[15:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[15:18] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[15:26] me011 | You don't know what they could be .
"[15:27] fe008 | Yeah now TIMIT 's clear um and PLP is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say "" nine two "" or you can say "" ninety - two "" , and uh"
[15:27] me018 | Yeah .
[15:43] fe008 | I 'd handle the numbers individually .
"[15:45] me011 | How are you doing the uh , acronyms so if I say PZM what would it appear on the transcript ?"
[15:51] me011 | OK .
[15:57] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[16:00] me011 | Right .
[16:00] fe008 | I don't know if that 's really necessary to do that .
"[16:06] fe008 | uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the"
[16:12] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:14] fe008 | you know , uh enumerated , or i it 's not a good way of saying but it 's it 's the specific uh way of stating these these letters ."
[16:23] me011 | Right . So it sounds good .
"[16:25] fe008 | And so anyway , the clean those are those things and then channelized is to then um , get it into this multichannel format ."
[16:32] fe008 | And at that point then it 's ready for use by Liz and Don .
"[16:36] fe008 | But that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized , the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins ."
[16:42] mn014 | Yeah .
[16:42] me011 | Right .
"[16:43] fe008 | And uh , Thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um"
"[16:49] fe008 | uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and I haven't I haven't been able to use that yet cuz I 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized ."
[16:58] mn014 | I actually gave
"[16:58] me011 | Have you also been doing spot checks , Jane ?"
[17:00] fe008 | Oh yes . Well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . I spent
"[17:01] me011 | Okay , good ."
"[17:03] fe008 | um actually um I have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,"
[17:09] me011 | Oh good . Good .
"[17:10] fe008 | and I went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word . And there are some differences in commas cuz commas I I left them discretion at commas ."
[17:19] me011 | Right .
[17:19] fe008 | Uh and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .
[17:24] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:25] fe008 | And um ,"
"[17:27] fe008 | and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same ,"
"[17:32] fe008 | in in huge patches of the data . And I have t ten minute stretch where I can where I can show that . And and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . So"
[17:44] me018 | Hmm .
"[17:44] fe008 | um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up "" gobbledy - gook "" . And the other one didn't . And on this side , this one 's picking up things like "" neural nets "" and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't ."
[17:56] me011 | Right .
"[17:57] me018 | When for the person who missed "" gobbledy - gook "" what did they put ?"
[18:07] me018 | Oh .
[18:08] me018 | Oh good .
[18:13] me018 | Sort of how it sounds .
[18:14] me018 | Yeah .
[18:21] me018 | Yeah .
[18:21] fe008 | Yeah . But she knew that she didn't know it . Maybe it was a technical ter exactly . But she even though her technical perception is just really uh you know I 've I 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any
"[18:29] fe008 | courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses then cuz "" neural nets "" and oh she has some things that are oh "" downsampled "" , she got that right ."
[18:32] me011 | Right .
[18:32] me018 | Hmm .
[18:37] fe008 | And some of these are rather uh unexpected .
"[18:39] me011 | Obscure , yeah ."
[18:45] me013 | And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? Is that right ?
[18:49] fe008 | Yes exactly .
"[18:49] me013 | Yeah , OK ."
[18:52] fe008 | Eleven hours .
[18:53] me013 | Is that is that that including digits ?
[18:55] me013 | Yeah .
[19:00] me013 | I mean it 's probably more than that but but with of of non - digits .
[19:00] fe008 | It 'd be more than that because I my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half a minute . Per person .
[19:01] mn014 | Yeah .
"[19:07] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[19:08] fe008 | But um the the total set that I gave them is twelve hours of tape ,"
"[19:12] me013 | Oh , I see ."
[19:13] fe008 | But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet . So they 're still working some of them are Two of them are still working on completing that .
"[19:15] me013 | Oh , I see ."
[19:21] fe008 | Yeah .
"[19:24] me018 | Boy , they 're moving right along ."
[19:25] fe008 | Yeah . They are . Mm - hmm . They 're very efficient .
[19:25] me013 | Yeah .
[19:27] fe008 | There 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . Yeah .
[19:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[19:29] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[19:35] mn014 | The channel u thing ?
[19:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[19:36] mn014 | Oh , it 's just uh , I ran the recognizer uh , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels and ,"
"[19:42] mn014 | it 's just in uh in this new multi - channel format and output , and"
"[19:45] me013 | Oh , I see ."
[19:46] mn014 | I just gave one one meeting to to Liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer
"[19:53] mn014 | as uh , apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech , which took too much memory or whatever ,"
[19:57] me013 | Right .
[20:01] me013 | Yeah .
[20:08] me011 | Is this anything different than the HMM system you were using before ?
[20:08] me013 | Yeah .
[20:09] mn014 | No .
"[20:11] mn014 | Uh ,"
"[20:13] mn014 | I mmm , use some some different features but not not The basic thing is this HMM base ."
[20:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[20:20] me011 | no knowledge using different channels at the same time . You know what I mean ?
"[20:24] mn014 | There is some , uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah ."
[20:28] me011 | Across all of them . OK .
[20:30] mn014 | So . But basically that 's one of the main changes .
[20:33] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[20:34] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:39] me013 | energy ? You said you 're trying some different features , or something ."
"[20:42] mn014 | Oh I just uh Mmm ,"
[20:55] me013 | Cu - Cube root ?
[20:56] mn014 | Yeah .
"[20:59] mn014 | No , I changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the how do you call it ? I 'm not sure ."
[21:01] me011 | Hmm .
[21:02] me013 | Ah .
[21:06] me013 | Fletcher Munson ?
[21:07] me013 | No .
"[21:10] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[21:13] me013 | Yeah , alright ."
[21:22] me013 | OK .
"[21:26] mn014 | uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel ,"
[21:34] mn014 | yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .
[21:41] me013 | Uh - huh .
[21:44] mn014 | So .
[21:45] me013 | OK .
[21:46] me011 | Good .
"[21:48] me013 | Um , let 's see ."
[21:52] me013 | Were were you basically done with the transcription part ?
[21:55] me013 | So I guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing .
[22:00] me011 | The idea is that we need to have We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting
"[22:05] me011 | to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages ,"
"[22:12] me011 | uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded ."
"[22:20] me011 | And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded ."
"[22:27] me011 | And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue ."
[22:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:31] me011 | And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , a single password . Each person will have a single password , user name and password ."
"[22:41] me011 | And then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it ."
[22:47] me011 | And that way each person only has to remember one password .
"[23:00] me013 | Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it ."
"[23:10] me013 | And then um if I thought it was OK , I 'd say "" it 's OK "" ."
[23:14] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:16] me013 | uh I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the"
[23:22] me013 | occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it
[23:27] me013 | was gonna be extremely rare .
[23:35] me013 | OK .
"[23:37] me011 | And so that that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text ."
"[23:43] me011 | So m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready ,"
"[23:47] me011 | um I would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted ,"
"[23:55] me011 | and just uh , tell them , "" here 's the web page "" ,"
"[23:58] me011 | um , "" you need a password "" . So th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords ,"
[24:04] me011 | and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .
"[24:12] me013 | "" here is a here is """
"[24:14] me013 | I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper ,"
"[24:21] me013 | that said , uh , "" here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ?"
"[24:25] me013 | and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK "" . And then they 'd hand it back to you ."
[24:30] me011 | I think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .
[24:39] me011 | ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .
[24:40] me013 | You find it easier to go through a large I mean how do you read books ?
"[24:44] me011 | Well I certainly read books by hand . But for something like this , I think it 's easier to do it on the web ."
[24:48] me013 | Really ?
"[24:50] me011 | Cuz you 're gonna get , you know , if I I 'm I 'm in a bunch of meetings and I don't wanna get a stack of these . I wanna just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as I want ."
"[24:58] me013 | Going to a web site is easy , but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web ."
"[25:04] me011 | Well , I don't think it 's that much harder than , paper ."
[25:07] me013 | Really ?
[25:07] me011 | So .
"[25:15] me013 | So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong , but the way I imagined it was that"
[25:16] fe008 | Yeah .
"[25:20] me013 | um , the largest set of people is gonna go "" oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? """
"[25:29] me013 | And then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? OK there 's I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . OK there 'll be a subset of people ,"
"[25:38] me013 | who um , will say uh "" well , yeah , I really would like to see that . "" And for them ,"
"[25:44] me013 | the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,"
"[25:48] me013 | I mean unless you 're searching . Searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing ."
[25:55] mn014 | Yeah .
[25:58] me013 | Um
[26:00] me013 | if if uh
"[26:02] me013 | you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out ."
"[26:11] me013 | I mean , so it 's it 's I mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time , you wanna figure you have a train ride ,"
"[26:21] me013 | I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway . And then I figured ,"
"[26:25] me013 | that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go "" hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , """
"[26:32] me013 | S It seems like i if I 'm right in that ,"
[26:35] me013 | it seems like you 're setting it up for
"[26:38] me013 | the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case ."
"[26:43] me013 | So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people"
"[26:48] me011 | For the most frequent case they just say "" it 's OK "" and then they 're done ."
[26:54] me011 | And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .
[26:54] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[26:59] fe008 | The other thing too is it seems like Go ahead .
"[27:00] me013 | Um ,"
"[27:01] me013 | yeah , that 's true ."
[27:02] mn014 | Yeah .
"[27:04] me013 | I guess Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature . I guess an email OK is alright ."
"[27:08] me011 | Oh that was another thing I I had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient ."
[27:15] me011 | But I don't actually know .
[27:16] me018 | Are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?
[27:22] me011 | Yes .
"[27:26] me011 | If someone feels strongly enough about it ,"
[27:29] me011 | then I I I think they should be allowed to do that .
[27:32] me018 | So that means other people are editing what you say ?
[27:35] me011 | Yeah .
[27:35] me013 | I don't know about that .
"[27:37] me011 | Well , the only other choice is that the person would say "" no , don't distribute this meeting at all "" , and I would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say "" don't distribute it at all "" ."
[27:47] me013 | But th
"[27:48] me013 | what they signed in the consent form ,"
[27:51] me013 | was something that said you can use my voice .
[27:56] me013 | Right ?
[27:59] me013 | Yeah .
"[28:02] me013 | Yeah , but that 's our decision then . Right ?"
"[28:04] me011 | Um , I don't think so ."
[28:06] me013 | I think it is .
"[28:06] me011 | I mean , because if I object to the conversation . If I say"
"[28:10] me011 | "" we were having a conversation , and I consider that conversation private , """
"[28:14] me011 | and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , I wanna be able to bleep out your side ."
"[28:20] fe008 | The I agree that the consent forms were uh , I cons agree with what Adam 's saying , that um ,"
[28:26] fe008 | the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .
[28:32] me013 | I see .
"[28:33] me013 | OK , well , if that 's what it said ."
"[28:33] fe008 | And the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l I 'm not a law lawyer , but it strikes me that uh , we wouldn't want someone to say "" oh yes , I was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access "" ."
"[28:45] fe008 | So I think it 's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it . Now in terms of like editing it by hand , I mean I think it 's i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part"
"[28:55] fe008 | by having a document they edited . But but it seems to me that sometimes um ,"
"[29:01] fe008 | you know i if a person had a bad day , and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like , you know it 's nice it 's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was OK ."
[29:09] me011 | I mean I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it .
"[29:12] me013 | Um I mean it 's also a mixture of people , I mean some people are r"
[29:13] me011 | Um .
"[29:17] me013 | do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not ."
[29:21] me011 | Yep .
[29:24] me013 | a set of skills that they would have to gain .
[29:27] me013 | You know ? It depends on what meetings .
[29:27] me011 | Well I think most of the people in the meetings are the former .
[29:28] fe008 | That 's true .
[29:31] me018 | So far .
[29:32] me011 | So .
"[29:32] me013 | In the meetings so far , yeah ."
[29:34] me011 | Yep .
"[29:34] me013 | But we 're trying to expand this , right ?"
[29:36] me011 | Right .
[29:37] me013 | So I I I actually think that paper is the more universal thing .
[29:41] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[29:41] me011 | Well , but if they want to print it out that 's alright . I think everyone in the meeting can access the web ."
"[29:49] me011 | OK , so does that mean that I can't use email ?"
[29:52] me011 | Or what ?
[29:53] fe008 | Cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking .
"[29:56] me011 | Well , I don't think I well I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues ."
"[29:58] fe008 | Good . For security ? Yeah , OK good . Good point ."
[29:59] me013 | No .
[30:00] mn014 | Yeah .
[30:00] me013 | Right .
[30:01] me011 | Um .
"[30:03] me011 | So giving them , you think a web site to say , "" if you wanna print it out here it is "" , is not sufficient ?"
[30:06] mn014 | Yeah .
[30:09] mn014 | I
"[30:12] me011 | Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them ."
[30:19] fe008 | You could mail it to them . Get an a mailing address .
[30:20] mn014 | Yeah .
[30:21] me011 | Equivalent .
"[30:26] mn014 | Just put the button on on the web page which say "" please send me the the scripts "" ."
[30:31] fe008 | Oh that 's interesting .
[30:31] me011 | That 's right .
[30:32] mn014 | Yeah .
[30:38] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[30:39] me018 | And so can they bleep within an utterance ?
[30:41] me011 | No . Whole utterances only .
[30:42] me018 | Whole utterances .
"[30:44] me011 | And that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's uh , uh"
[30:48] me011 | it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level .
[30:53] me011 | Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .
[31:00] me013 | is part of why this is bothering me .
"[31:03] me013 | Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this ."
"[31:11] me011 | I mean that 's why I did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient ."
[31:11] me018 | Mmm .
[31:13] me013 | I I I understand . I think that 's the bad idea .
[31:15] me018 | I know where you 're going .
"[31:30] me013 | There was a one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by ,"
[31:35] me013 | but overall people are talking about technical topics . Nobody 's gonna get hurt . Nobody 's being l libeled .
"[31:42] me013 | You know , this is this we 're we 're covering We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case ."
"[31:48] me013 | If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache ."
"[31:59] me011 | I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . So ."
"[32:06] me018 | I think what Morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped ."
[32:10] me013 | And and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing .
[32:13] me013 | I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue .
[32:21] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:22] me013 | You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , but it might be , uh it might be really a a pain ."
[32:22] mn014 | Yeah .
[32:35] me013 | we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence .
"[32:42] me013 | And and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun !"
"[32:50] me013 | and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so "" well I didn't like what he said . """
"[32:54] me011 | Well I don't see any way of avoiding that . I mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like ."
[33:03] me013 | Yeah .
[33:10] me011 | The problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me .
"[33:13] me011 | Whereas this web interface , I just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and I can just insert it ."
[33:17] me013 | So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .
[33:22] fe008 | Yeah . Hmm .
[33:24] me013 | So maybe this is a s a way out of it .
"[33:28] me013 | handle , and useful for someone else if they need it ."
[33:32] me013 | But
"[33:33] me013 | I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it ."
[33:39] me018 | So you 're saying the the sequence would be more like
"[33:42] me018 | first Adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting ."
[33:49] me013 | Right .
"[33:50] me018 | And then if they don't , you 're done . If they do , then he provides them access to the the web site ."
[33:55] me013 | W w
"[33:56] me011 | Well , to some extent I have to do that anyway because as I said we have to distribute passwords ."
[33:56] me018 | Or a printed - out form .
[34:00] me013 | y
"[34:00] me011 | So ,"
[34:01] me013 | but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying .
[34:05] me018 | Only if they want it .
[34:06] me011 | what I 'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that 's not secure .
[34:09] me011 | So they have to call me and ask .
[34:12] me013 | Right .
[34:13] me013 | But we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .
"[34:17] me011 | Well , we do because of privacy . We can't just make it openly available on the web ."
"[34:20] me013 | No , no . You 're missing the point ."
[34:22] me013 | We 're We 're trying i
[34:23] me013 | We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l
"[34:27] me013 | uh fall off a log , to do this ."
"[34:29] fe008 | Not everyone gets a password ,"
[34:31] fe008 | unless they ask for it . Yeah .
[34:31] me013 | Right ?
"[34:31] me013 | So th so what I would see , is that"
"[34:35] me013 | first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the not just for fun ,"
[34:40] me013 | OK ? but to to check this
"[34:43] me013 | for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory ."
"[34:50] me013 | Um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , OK ?"
"[34:57] me013 | Then , if someone uh wants to review it ,"
"[35:01] me013 | uh , and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out ."
"[35:07] me013 | And then if they say that "" I have a potential problem with these things , "" then ,"
"[35:17] me011 | But the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me ."
[35:22] me011 | Because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .
"[35:29] me011 | I would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . Obviously they don't have to ."
"[35:35] me013 | I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble we have there 's a problem with it ."
[35:37] me011 | Yeah . So I think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and I just don't think that 's gonna happen .
"[35:48] fe008 | that uh , it 's I th I th You know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect ,"
"[35:58] fe008 | then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um ,"
"[36:04] fe008 | but but they might be able to argue "" oh well it was cumbersome , and I was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down "" . So it could that the burden would come back onto us . So I 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint ."
[36:17] fe008 | Yeah .
"[36:19] me011 | It seems to me that sending them email ,"
[36:21] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[36:22] me011 | saying "" if you have an O - OK reply to this email and say OK ,"
"[36:25] me011 | If you have a problem with it contact me and I 'll give you a password "" ,"
"[36:29] me011 | seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . And if they want a printout they can print it out themselves ."
[36:36] mn014 | Yeah .
"[36:41] fe008 | um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . And and I ha I don't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage ."
[36:49] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:58] me011 | Having it . Well the in the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it , so ."
[36:59] fe008 | Giving it to them . OK .
[37:00] fe008 | Alright . Fine . OK . Fair enough .
[37:03] me013 | Yeah .
[37:04] me011 | D you want me to grab one ?
"[37:06] me011 | Yeah , but you 're wired aren't you ?"
[37:07] fe008 | Yeah . That is true .
[37:11] me013 | Um .
[37:15] fe008 | Oh yeah yeah oh I know .
[37:21] fe008 | Yeah that 's true . Yeah .
[37:28] me013 | Yeah .
[37:41] fe008 | Hmm .
[37:42] fe008 | Well that 's more open than I realized .
[37:45] me011 | The one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .
[37:47] mn014 | Yeah .
"[37:48] me013 | Yeah , uh no that it tha that 's right ."
"[37:48] fe008 | Tha - that 's true . That 's more severe ,"
"[37:50] fe008 | but the next one says the transcript will be around . And it doesn't really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything ."
[37:56] me018 | I think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them .
[37:58] fe008 | At least it more often . Yeah .
[38:00] fe008 | It means also we don't have to g
[38:04] me011 | They just have to make sure that it is available to them .
[38:06] fe008 | It 's available to them if they ask for it .
"[38:08] me013 | Yeah , OK , so . wh um I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is ,"
"[38:13] me013 | um , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded ."
"[38:19] me013 | So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data ."
[38:31] me011 | Right .
"[38:32] me013 | That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out , that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field"
[38:35] fe008 | Good .
[38:45] me013 | And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias .
"[38:50] fe008 | Great . Great , great . Yeah . I agree ."
[39:11] me013 | Well I don't know . I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out . You know . I -
[39:17] me013 | Oh they won't ?
[39:20] me013 | Oh good . So you haven't made it so much fun .
[39:23] me011 | It just sends me the time intervals . And then at some point I 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .
"[39:28] me011 | I mean I don't wanna have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space ."
[39:28] me013 | Yeah .
[39:36] me013 | Yeah .
[39:37] me011 | So I I wanna I just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it .
[39:43] me013 | OK .
[39:45] me013 | Yeah so if we have if i
"[39:47] me013 | Again let 's you know , sort of"
[39:57] me013 | OK .
"[40:01] me013 | Turn about is fair play , Sorry ."
"[40:02] fe008 | Also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that Adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever and I don't know how that works . i There 's something down there about "" if you agree to """
[40:09] me011 | Yeah .
"[40:14] me013 | I 'm I 'm I 'm I thought I I thought about it with one of my background processes and I uh it 's uh it 's uh , it 's fine to do the email ."
[40:14] me011 | I don't think so .
[40:20] fe008 | Ah .
[40:23] fe008 | Fine . Good . OK .
[40:24] me011 | Yeah because thi th they 're signing here that they 're agreeing to the paragraph which says
"[40:28] me011 | "" you 'll be given an opportunity . """
[40:30] me011 | And so I don't think they need another signature .
[40:32] me013 | Well and furthermore I it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth that that uh if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're
"[40:42] me013 | you 're saying uh "" OK I agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and I agree that 's OK , """
[40:48] me013 | uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now so it 's it 's OK .
[40:51] me011 | Right .
[40:55] fe008 | Great .
[40:56] me013 | Um .
"[40:59] me011 | So I guess I probably should at the minimum ,"
[41:02] me011 | think about how to present it in a printed form .
"[41:07] me011 | I 'm not really sure what 's best with that . The problem is a lot of them are really short ,"
[41:11] me011 | and so I don't necessarily wanna do one per line .
[41:14] me011 | But I don't know how else to do it .
"[41:15] fe008 | I also have this I I think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about"
"[41:22] fe008 | um , the non nonverbal side , I mean I I agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , and but"
[41:36] me011 | Hmm .
[41:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[41:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[41:43] me011 | Yeah I think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh
[41:50] me011 | not good .
"[41:51] me011 | You know , if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that ."
[41:57] me011 | Right .
[42:05] mn014 | Yeah .
[42:07] fe008 | Or or even or even there was a a line you know about how
[42:09] me013 | Yeah .
"[42:13] mn014 | Oh , God ."
[42:25] fe008 | Yeah .
"[42:26] fe008 | So I don't know . I mean , I I guess we 're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by ."
[42:34] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[42:43] me013 | i i
"[42:44] me013 | I mean , you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said ,"
[42:48] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:49] me013 | but , when they hear it , themselves , they may hear something different because they know what they meant ."
[43:00] fe008 | I don't know how to notate that .
"[43:04] me018 | Sarcasm , how do you how do you indicate sarcasm ?"
"[43:06] me013 | No , I 'm serious ."
"[43:07] me013 | So the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that such - and - such was ,"
"[43:13] me013 | you know , not not really what I said ."
[43:16] me011 | Yeah .
"[43:17] me011 | Well that would be good to get , definitely ."
"[43:17] me013 | Yeah , but ,"
"[43:18] me013 | Yeah , sure ."
[43:19] me011 | Just for corrections .
[43:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[43:21] me011 | So um , in terms of password distribution , I think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . Or mail , physical mail ."
[43:26] fe008 | Yeah .
[43:28] fe008 | Or if for leave it on their voice mail .
[43:29] me018 | Any sub - word level thing . @ @
[43:34] me011 | I mean you could do it with PGP or things like that but it 's too complex .
"[43:45] fe008 | I mean i well , and actually also the lawyer saying that um , we shouldn't really have them have the people"
[43:53] fe008 | believing that they will be cleared by our checks . You know ?
[43:57] fe008 | I mean . So it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to
[43:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:07] me013 | I mean ,"
"[44:09] me013 | most people will not wanna take the time to do that , though ."
"[44:12] fe008 | Yeah , OK , fair enough ."
"[44:13] fe008 | And they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . So it 's not it 's not um Yeah , good ."
"[44:34] fe008 | It is true that tec that the content is technical , I and so i"
[44:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[44:39] fe008 | I I mean , when I listen to these things , I don't find things that are questionable ,"
[44:43] fe008 | in other people 's speech or in my own .
[44:45] fe008 | It should be very rare .
"[44:48] fe008 | Yeah . Yeah , OK ."
[44:51] me011 | How about them energy crises .
[44:53] me013 | Yeah .
[45:12] me013 | Yeah .
[45:12] mn009 | I don't really have anything specific to to talk about .
[45:15] me013 | That 's fine .
"[45:18] mn009 | Oh , OK ."
[45:19] me013 | You don't have anything to say .
[45:29] me011 | Shall we do digits ?
[45:30] me013 | Oh yeah .
"[45:31] me011 | Um , oh by the way I did find a bunch Uh , we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there ?"
[45:35] me018 | There were quite a few .
"[45:36] me011 | That 's what I thought . I f I was going through them all and I found actually a lot filed in with them ,"
[45:36] me018 | Uh .
"[45:40] me011 | that were blanks , that no one had actually read . And so we still have more than I thought we did . So , we have a few more digits before we 're done ."
[45:43] me018 | Mmm .
[45:45] me018 | Oh good .
[50:01] me018 | You know having this headset reminds me of like working at Burger King or something . No I never did .
"[50:06] fe008 | Oh , did you do that ?"

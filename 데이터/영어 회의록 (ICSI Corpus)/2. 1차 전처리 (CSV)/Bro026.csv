[00:05] me018 | OK .
"[00:15] me013 | We we had a meeting with , uh with Hynek ,"
"[00:19] me013 | um , in in which , uh ,"
"[00:22] me013 | uh ,"
"[00:23] me013 | Sunil and Stephane ,"
[00:24] me013 | uh
"[00:29] me013 | and , uh ,"
[00:31] me013 | talked about where we were gonna go .
[00:33] me013 | So that that happened sort of mid - week .
[00:35] me018 | D did did you guys get your code
[00:36] me013 | Uh .
"[00:39] mn052 | Oh , yeah ."
[00:40] me018 | pushed together ?
[00:40] mn052 | Yeah .
"[00:42] mn052 | It 's it 's it 's it was updated yesterday , right ?"
[00:42] me018 | Cool .
[00:45] mn007 | Yeah .
[00:45] mn052 | Yeah .
"[00:45] me018 | Oh , right , I saw I saw the note ."
[00:46] mn007 | You probably received the mail . Yeah .
[00:49] me013 | What was the update ?
[00:51] mn007 | What was the update ?
[00:52] me013 | Yeah .
[00:52] mn007 | So there is th then the all the new features that go in .
"[00:56] mn007 | The , um ,"
"[00:57] mn007 | noise suppression ,"
[01:00] mn007 | the re - synthesis of speech after suppression .
[01:04] mn007 | These are the Yeah .
[01:04] me018 | the CVS mechanism working well ?
"[01:08] me018 | Are are people ,"
"[01:09] me018 | uh , up at OGI grabbing code"
"[01:11] me018 | uh , via that ?"
[01:13] me018 | Or ?
[01:15] me018 | Uh - huh .
[01:18] mn052 | working on it right now .
[01:19] me018 | Mmm .
[01:20] me013 | I think it more likely that what it means is that when Sunil is up there
[01:23] mn052 | Yeah .
[01:24] me013 | he will grab it .
[01:24] mn052 | Yeah .
[01:25] me018 | Yeah .
[01:25] mn052 | So right now nobody 's working on Aurora there .
[01:27] me018 | I see .
[01:27] me013 | They 're Yeah . They 're working on a different task .
[01:28] me018 | I see .
[01:29] mn052 | Yeah .
[01:29] me018 | OK .
[01:30] me013 | But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there
"[01:36] me013 | from , uh , the east coast ."
[01:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[01:38] me013 | Uh .
"[01:40] me013 | and and I guess actually , uh , after Eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too . So , actually"
[01:45] me013 | everybody
[01:49] me013 | So they 'll remotely access it from there . Yeah .
[01:51] me018 | Has anybody tried
"[01:52] me018 | remotely accessing the CVS using , uh ,"
"[01:55] me018 | uh , SSH ?"
"[01:57] mn007 | Um ,"
[01:58] mn007 | I don't know if Hari did that or You d
"[02:04] mn052 | No , I didn't ."
[02:04] me018 | OK .
[02:04] mn052 | So I I 'll try it today .
[02:05] me013 | Good idea .
[02:06] me013 | Yeah .
[02:06] mn052 | Yeah .
"[02:09] mn007 | repository , I tried from Belgium ."
[02:12] mn007 | I
[02:12] me018 | Yeah ?
[02:14] me018 | It worked good ?
"[02:15] mn007 | Yeah , it works ."
"[02:15] me018 | Oh , good !"
[02:16] me018 | Great !
[02:16] mn052 | Oh .
"[02:17] mn007 | So , right now it 's the mechanism with SSH ."
[02:24] mn007 | on a new port .
[02:24] mn007 | It 's like
[02:25] me018 | Yeah .
[02:25] me018 | Right .
"[02:26] mn007 | well uh , a main server , or d You can do a CVS server ."
"[02:28] me018 | Then that 's using the CVS password mechanism and all that , right ?"
[02:29] mn007 | But .
"[02:31] mn007 | Yeah , right ."
[02:35] me018 | So w
"[02:39] me018 | Belgium , using SSH ,"
"[02:41] me018 | uh ,"
[02:44] me018 | password into ICSI ?
[02:45] me018 | So if yo you can only do that if you have an account at ICSI ?
[02:45] mn007 | Right .
[02:47] mn007 | Yeah .
[02:47] me018 | OK .
[02:48] mn007 | Yeah .
"[02:51] mn007 | Yeah , you ha in this way you ca you have to set up a CVS server but then ,"
"[02:56] mn007 | yeah , you can access it ."
[02:59] mn007 | you you can set up priorities . You can access them and mostly if you if y the set the server is set up like this .
[03:03] me018 | OK .
[03:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:09] me018 | Uh ,"
"[03:10] me018 | I mean , for our transcripts we may want to do that ."
[03:12] me013 | Yeah .
[03:12] me018 | Uh .
[03:15] me013 | quite up to that .
[03:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:16] me013 | I mean , we 're still so much in development . We want to have just the insiders ."
"[03:17] me018 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[03:20] me018 | thinking of the Meeting Recorder stuff but .
[03:22] me013 | Yeah .
[03:22] me018 | Yeah . OK . Cool .
[03:32] me018 | What 's new ?
[03:35] me013 | maybe the thing
"[03:39] me013 | on , uh ,"
"[03:40] me013 | details of that since the meeting , right ?"
[03:46] me013 | That was that was Tuesday .
"[03:46] mn007 | well , I I 've been I 've been train"
[03:51] me013 | OK .
[03:52] mn007 | So they should be ready .
[03:54] mn007 | Um .
"[03:58] me013 | yo you guys weren't at that that meeting ,"
"[04:00] me013 | might be just just to ,"
"[04:02] me013 | um ,"
"[04:03] me013 | sort of recap ,"
[04:06] me013 | the conclusions of the meeting .
"[04:07] me018 | Oh , great ."
[04:08] me018 | You 're talking about the meeting with Hynek ?
[04:08] me013 | So .
"[04:09] me013 | Yeah . Cuz that was sort of , uh we we 'd sort of been working up to that ,"
[04:13] me018 | Uh - huh .
[04:16] me013 | Since he 's going out of town
"[04:19] me013 | like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks ,"
"[04:21] me013 | uh ,"
"[04:23] me013 | and time is marching , sort of ,"
"[04:25] me013 | given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ?"
[04:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:31] me013 | and what do we freeze ? And , you know , what do we ?"
"[04:33] me013 | So ,"
[04:34] me013 | um .
[04:36] me013 | software that these guys created was certainly a a key part .
[04:39] me013 | So then there 's something central and there aren't at least
[04:45] me013 | differ trivially .
[04:47] me018 | Yeah .
[04:49] me018 | That 's that 's nice .
"[04:50] me013 | and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now ,"
"[04:56] me013 | to run it , uh , a particular way ,"
[04:58] me013 | and decide on what things
"[05:01] me013 | are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything ."
[05:05] me013 | So keep a certain set of things constant .
"[05:08] me013 | So , um ."
"[05:11] me013 | Uh ,"
"[05:15] me013 | what we are keeping constant for now , or ?"
[05:18] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:19] mn007 | Well .
[05:23] mn007 | on the noise compensation and
[05:25] mn007 | we end up with
[05:26] mn007 | something that seems reasonable .
[05:29] mn007 | Um .
[05:30] me018 | Are you gonna use which of the two techniques ?
"[05:34] mn007 | So finally it 's it 's , um , Wiener filtering"
[05:37] mn007 | on FFT bins .
"[05:39] mn007 | And it uses , uh , two steps ,"
"[05:42] mn007 | smoothing of the transfer function ,"
"[05:44] mn007 | the first step ,"
"[05:45] mn007 | that 's along time ,"
[05:46] mn007 | which use recursion .
[05:49] mn007 | And
[05:51] mn007 | after this step
"[05:52] mn007 | there is a further smoothing along frequency ,"
[05:55] mn007 | which use a sliding window of twenty FFT bins .
[06:00] mn007 | Mmm .
"[06:04] me018 | uh ,"
"[06:08] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[06:09] me013 | This this smoothing is done on the estimate ,"
[06:09] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:12] me013 | um , of what you 're going to subtract ?"
[06:14] me013 | Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?
"[06:19] mn007 | Uh ,"
[06:21] mn007 | it 's on the transfer function .
"[06:23] me013 | Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter ."
[06:25] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:25] me013 | Yeah , OK ."
"[06:30] mn007 | Yeah , so basically we tried"
"[06:38] mn007 | We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . Um ."
[06:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:02] me013 | Actually , let me int eh ,"
"[07:03] me013 | Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject ."
"[07:06] me013 | This module ,"
"[07:08] me013 | in principle ,"
"[07:09] me013 | i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact ,"
"[07:11] me013 | is somewhat independent from the rest of it . I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ?"
[07:16] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:16] me013 | So ,"
[07:18] me013 | um .
[07:22] mn007 | We we do not fo
"[07:23] me013 | Uh , but you could ."
"[07:25] mn007 | Well well , we do , but we don't don't re - synthesize . In in the program we don't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . We just"
[07:32] mn007 | use the clean FFT bins .
[07:34] me013 | But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here .
[07:35] mn007 | This is an option that then you can Yeah .
"[07:37] me013 | Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um ,"
"[07:39] me013 | i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding"
"[07:47] me013 | for an artificial situation ,"
[07:49] me013 | we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well .
[07:52] me013 | But for the real situation
"[07:55] me013 | uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well ."
"[08:02] me013 | So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise"
[08:05] me013 | removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at .
[08:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:09] me013 | And , uh , generate new files or whatever ,"
"[08:12] me013 | and and , uh ,"
[08:14] me013 | uh and then do the reverberation part .
[08:20] mn052 | Mmm .
[08:20] me013 | Anyway .
[08:21] me018 | So Dave hasn't tried that yet ?
"[08:23] me013 | No , no . He 's I mean , e a"
[08:28] me006 | Pre - prelim hell .
[08:28] me018 | Yeah .
[08:29] me018 | Yeah .
"[08:31] me013 | Uh ,"
"[08:34] me013 | we are not with the real case that we 're looking at ,"
[08:37] me013 | we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable .
[08:44] me013 | And that 's
"[08:45] me013 | I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh ,"
"[08:48] me013 | and this is hard enough ,"
[08:49] me013 | the interaction between channel effects
"[08:52] me013 | and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects ."
"[08:58] me013 | And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really I mean , we 're trying to deal with that ."
[09:02] me013 | In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task .
"[09:05] me013 | And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects ."
[09:12] me013 | And we have the
[09:14] me013 | noise suppression that 's doing something about noise .
"[09:17] me013 | Uh , even that 's hard enough . And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category ."
[09:23] me013 | i i
[09:23] me013 | There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work
[09:27] me013 | so hard on on juggling everything around .
"[09:29] me013 | But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse ,"
"[09:31] me013 | because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects ."
"[09:36] me013 | And , um , so"
"[09:38] me013 | Dave has something which ,"
"[09:40] me013 | uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too ,"
"[09:49] me013 | Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh , where you have the microphone distant ,"
"[09:55] me013 | is going to have both things ,"
[09:57] me013 | we we actually have to think about both at the same time .
[10:02] me018 | Hmm .
"[10:09] me013 | So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then ,"
"[10:16] mn007 | Yeah , well , the , um ,"
[10:16] me013 | the form we have .
[10:22] mn007 | the blocks that were already present before and that
[10:26] mn007 | we did not modify a lot .
"[10:32] me013 | So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed"
"[10:36] me013 | uh , that 's done at the FFT level ."
"[10:39] mn007 | Yeah , th then the mel filter bank ,"
[10:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:43] mn007 | then the log operation ,"
[10:46] mn007 | Mmm .
[10:50] me013 | in the frequency domain ?
[10:53] mn007 | Yeah .
"[10:54] me013 | Yeah , OK ."
"[10:56] me013 | And then the mel and then the log ,"
[10:58] me013 | and then the
"[10:58] mn007 | Then the LDA filter ,"
[10:59] me013 | LDA filter .
"[11:01] mn007 | mmm ,"
[11:03] me013 | And then
[11:04] me013 | uh
"[11:04] mn007 | then the downsampling ,"
"[11:06] me013 | downsample ,"
"[11:08] mn007 | DCT ,"
"[11:09] me013 | DCT ,"
"[11:12] mn007 | then , um , on - line normalization ,"
"[11:16] me013 | on - line norm ,"
[11:20] mn007 | followed by upsampling .
"[11:23] mn007 | Then finally , we compute delta and"
[11:26] mn007 | we put
[11:28] mn007 | the neural network also .
[11:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:40] me013 | Um .
"[11:41] mn007 | And finally frame dropping ,"
[11:42] mn007 | which
"[11:44] mn007 | um ,"
[11:46] mn007 | would
"[11:47] mn007 | be a neural network also , used for estimated silence probabilities . And"
[11:52] mn007 | the input of this neural network would be
[11:55] mn007 | somewhere between log mel bands or
[12:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[12:01] mn007 | one of the earlier stages of the processing .
"[12:02] me013 | So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff ."
[12:06] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:12] me013 | So the things that we , um ,"
"[12:15] me013 | uh ,"
"[12:17] me013 | I guess we sort of uh ,"
"[12:39] me013 | the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are ,"
"[12:45] me013 | uh , uh , a a significantly better VAD ,"
"[12:50] me013 | uh ,"
"[12:52] me013 | putting the neural net on ,"
"[12:54] me013 | um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with ,"
"[12:56] me013 | the , uh , neural net at the end there ,"
"[12:59] me013 | and , uh ,"
"[13:00] me013 | the , uh ,"
[13:06] me018 | The other half of the channel ?
[13:08] me018 | That what you mean ?
"[13:08] me013 | Yeah , yeah , I mean , cuz we we have we have , uh ,"
"[13:12] me013 | uh , half the the , uh ,"
[13:13] me013 | data rate that they allow .
"[13:16] me013 | And , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south"
"[13:22] me013 | was , uh ,"
"[13:24] me013 | that , um ,"
[13:26] me013 | we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum
[13:28] me013 | as the second one .
"[13:31] me013 | cheap , easy ."
[13:32] me013 | Uh .
"[13:34] me013 | There 's a question about exactly how we do it . We probably will go to something better later ,"
[13:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[13:39] me013 | but
"[13:39] me013 | the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently , so ."
[13:52] me013 | I was saying this before . I think he used to do
"[13:54] me013 | mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra ."
[13:56] me013 | He used them as alternate features .
[13:58] me018 | Hmm .
[13:59] me013 | Put them together .
[14:00] me013 | Uh .
"[14:01] me018 | So if you took the system the way it is now , the way it 's fro you 're gonna freeze it ,"
[14:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:04] me018 | and it ran it on the last evaluation , where it would it be ?"
"[14:09] mn007 | It , uh ,"
[14:09] me018 | In terms of ranking ?
[14:10] mn052 | Second .
[14:10] mn007 | Ri - right now it 's second .
[14:12] mn007 | Um .
[14:12] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:14] me013 | Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish , have you ?"
"[14:18] mn007 | No , we didn't . No , um ."
[14:19] me013 | Yeah .
[14:21] me018 | So on the ones that you did test it on it would have been second ?
[14:23] me013 | Yeah .
"[14:27] me013 | When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ?"
"[14:34] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[14:35] me013 | Yeah ,"
[14:36] me013 | OK .
[14:36] mn052 | And th the ranking actually didn't change after the German and Danish .
"[14:40] mn052 | So , yeah ."
[14:41] me013 | Well ranking
"[14:43] me013 | didn't before , but I 'm just asking"
[14:46] me013 | where this is to
[14:47] mn052 | Yeah .
"[14:48] me013 | where theirs was without the German and Danish , right ?"
[14:49] mn052 | Yeah .
[14:49] mn007 | Mmm .
"[14:50] mn052 | Yeah , yeah ."
[14:51] me013 | So .
[14:52] me018 | where were we actually on the last test ?
"[14:54] me013 | Oh , we were also esp"
"[15:02] me013 | we were third , but I mean ,"
"[15:03] me013 | there were two systems that were pretty close ,"
[15:03] me018 | Uh - huh .
[15:05] me018 | I see .
[15:05] me013 | that came from the same place .
[15:07] me018 | OK .
"[15:08] me013 | Uh ,"
"[15:08] me013 | so institutionally we were we were second ,"
"[15:11] me013 | with , uh , the third third system ."
[15:12] me018 | We 're so this second that you 're saying now is
[15:14] me018 | system - wide second ?
[15:17] me018 | Still institutionally second ?
"[15:21] me013 | Oh , are we ?"
[15:22] mn052 | Yeah .
[15:23] mn007 | It is a triumph .
"[15:23] mn052 | Their their first system is fifty - four point something . And , uh , we are fifty - three point something ."
[15:23] me013 | Is it ?
[15:28] mn052 | And their second system is also fifty - three point something .
"[15:30] mn052 | Yeah , one percent ."
[15:31] mn007 | one percent .
"[15:31] me018 | Oh , wow !"
[15:32] me018 | That 's very close .
[15:33] mn052 | Yeah .
[15:33] me018 | Yeah .
"[15:35] me013 | and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things ."
"[15:39] me013 | Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth but I I think ,"
"[15:48] me018 | all these these bits ? I mean , if we 're u u"
"[15:52] me013 | Um , why are we using half ?"
[15:53] me018 | Yeah .
"[15:54] me013 | Well , so you could you c"
"[15:58] me013 | uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong ,"
[16:01] me013 | but I I think that what 's going on is
"[16:04] me013 | that in in both cases ,"
[16:06] me013 | some kind of normalization is done
[16:08] me013 | to deal with convola convolutional effects .
"[16:11] me013 | Uh , they have some cepstral modification , right ?"
[16:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[16:14] me013 | In our case we have a couple things . We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA .
[16:20] me013 | they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us .
"[16:26] me013 | But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing . But there 's one difference ."
"[16:29] me013 | The LDA RASTA ,"
"[16:31] me013 | uh , throws away high modulation frequencies ."
[16:36] me013 | And they 're not doing that .
"[16:39] me013 | So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample ."
[16:43] me018 | I see .
[16:44] me018 | I see .
[16:47] me018 | So do you explicitly downsample then ?
[16:49] me018 | Do we explicitly downsample ?
[16:50] me013 | Yeah .
[16:51] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:51] me018 | And what if we didn't do that ?
[16:53] me018 | Would we get worse performance ?
"[16:56] me013 | I think it doesn't affect it , does it ?"
"[16:57] mn007 | Yeah , not better , not worse ."
[16:58] me018 | I see . OK .
[16:59] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:00] me013 | So I think the thing is , since"
[17:05] me018 | Yeah .
[17:05] me018 | Yeah .
[17:08] me013 | we 've found in a lot of
[17:10] me013 | ways for quite a while that having a second stream
"[17:13] me013 | uh , helps a lot ."
"[17:14] me013 | So that 's that 's put in , and"
"[17:16] me013 | you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple ."
[17:20] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[17:22] me013 | Um .
"[17:24] me013 | And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , "" oh , yeah , I understand "" , is is very helpful ."
"[17:31] me018 | You 're thinking to put the , uh ,"
[17:33] me018 | mel spectrum in before any of the noise removal stuff ? or after ?
"[17:37] me013 | Well , that 's a question ."
"[17:38] me013 | I mean , we were talking about that . It looks like"
"[17:42] me013 | to , uh , remove the noise ,"
"[17:45] me013 | um , and , uh ,"
"[17:47] me018 | Cuz that happens before the mel conversion , right ?"
[17:50] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:55] me013 | uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion ."
[17:58] me013 | There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not .
[18:03] me013 | Uh .
"[18:05] me013 | I sort of think you should , but"
[18:10] me013 | I don't know .
[18:13] mn007 | What about norm normalizing also ?
[18:17] me013 | Right .
[18:19] me013 | Uh .
"[18:24] me013 | Well ,"
[18:25] me013 | but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ?
[18:28] mn007 | Yeah .
"[18:29] me013 | Yeah , probably ."
[18:30] me013 | Some kind would be good .
[18:32] me013 | You know ? I would think .
"[18:39] mn052 | uh ,"
[18:40] mn052 | the frame .
[18:41] me013 | If you do or don't normalize ?
[18:44] mn052 | If yo if you don't normalize and if if you don't normalize .
[18:47] me013 | Right .
"[18:48] me013 | Yes , so I mean , one would think"
[18:49] me013 | that you would want to normalize .
[18:51] me013 | But I I w w
"[18:53] me013 | My thought is ,"
"[18:54] me013 | uh , particularly if you take the log ,"
[18:57] me013 | try it .
[18:59] me013 | And then
"[19:07] me013 | I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens . You want to change them one at a time . So adding this other stream in ,"
[19:12] me013 | that 's simple in some way .
[19:16] me013 | particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight
"[19:21] me013 | modifications of how you do normalization . Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot ."
"[19:26] me013 | So ,"
"[19:28] me013 | have some baseline that says , "" OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get "" , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization ."
[19:36] me013 | So I think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization . I agree .
"[19:39] me018 | So this second stream ,"
[19:41] me018 | will it add latency to the system or ?
"[19:44] me013 | No , it 's in parallel ."
[19:45] me018 | S
[19:45] me013 | We 're not talking about computation time here . We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out . So it 's just
[19:48] me018 | Yeah .
[19:49] me013 | in terms of what data it 's depending on . It 's depending on the same data as the other . So it 's in parallel .
[19:52] me018 | Same data . OK .
[19:56] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[19:58] me006 | So with this , uh , new stream would you train up a VAD on both both features , somehow ?"
"[20:06] mn052 | No , I guess the VAD has its own set of features ."
[20:09] me006 | OK .
"[20:10] mn052 | I mean , which could be this one of these streams , or it can be something derived from these streams ."
[20:10] me006 | OK .
[20:14] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:16] mn007 | And there is also the idea of using TRAPS , maybe , for the VAD ,"
"[20:27] mn007 | when , she was at IBM , that"
[20:30] mn007 | it 's a good idea .
[20:33] mn007 | So .
"[20:35] me006 | Would would that fit on the handset , or ?"
[20:38] me006 | Oh !
[20:40] mn007 | I have no idea .
[20:41] me006 | OK .
"[20:42] mn052 | Well , it has t I mean"
[20:44] mn052 | the th
"[20:45] mn052 | Yeah , if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff ."
[20:46] mn007 | Yeah .
"[20:50] me013 | Well , there 's the delays and the storage , yeah ."
[20:50] me006 | OK .
[20:52] mn052 | Yeah .
[20:52] me013 | But I don't think the storage is so big for that .
[20:52] me006 | Right .
[20:54] me013 | I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net .
[20:58] mn052 | Yeah .
[20:58] me013 | Right ? Yeah .
[21:00] me013 | Um .
[21:02] me013 | And so
"[21:04] me013 | I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS ,"
[21:08] me013 | and and how big are they ?
"[21:10] me006 | Oh , right ."
"[21:10] me013 | So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue ."
[21:13] me006 | Yeah . Cuz sh
[21:13] me013 | Maybe they can be little ones .
[21:15] me006 | Right .
"[21:16] me006 | Cuz she also does the , uh the correlation - based ,"
[21:17] me013 | Mini - TRAPS .
"[21:19] me006 | uh ,"
"[21:21] me006 | TRAPS ,"
"[21:22] me006 | with without the neural net , just"
[21:23] me013 | Right .
[21:24] me006 | looking at the
[21:25] me013 | And maybe for VAD they would be OK . Yeah .
[21:28] me006 | Yeah .
[21:28] me013 | Yeah .
[21:29] mn052 | Yeah .
[21:29] me013 | That 's true .
"[21:38] me013 | uh ,"
"[21:39] me013 | dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data . And so ,"
[21:42] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:44] me013 | uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is ,"
[21:48] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[21:49] me013 | It certainly doesn't take much space .
[21:51] me006 | Right .
"[21:51] me013 | So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ? Do you need to have"
[21:56] me013 | an added layer or something ?
"[21:57] me013 | In which case ,"
"[21:59] me013 | uh ,"
"[22:02] me013 | potentially ,"
"[22:03] me013 | you know , it could be big . So ."
[22:06] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:11] me013 | So , uh ,"
[22:15] me013 | So what 's next ?
[22:16] me013 | Maybe s s remind us .
[22:18] me018 | So the meeting with Hynek that you guys just had was to
[22:22] me018 | decide exactly what you were gonna freeze in this system ? Is that ?
[22:26] me018 | Or was there ?
"[22:27] me018 | Were you talking about what t new stuff , or ?"
[22:30] me013 | What to freeze and then what to do after we froze .
[22:32] me018 | Mmm .
[22:33] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:39] me013 | And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic"
"[22:44] me013 | I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and ,"
"[22:50] me013 | uh , the second stream ."
"[22:53] me013 | And then , uh ,"
[22:55] me013 | improving the VAD .
[22:58] me013 | Uh .
[23:01] me013 | So .
[23:02] mn052 | I 'll actually after the meeting I 'll add the second stream
[23:04] mn052 | to the VAD and maybe I 'll start with the feature net in that case .
"[23:09] mn052 | It 's like , you 're looking at the VAD , right ?"
"[23:12] mn007 | Uh , yeah ."
[23:13] mn007 | I I 've a new feature net ready also .
[23:15] mn052 | For the VAD ?
"[23:17] mn007 | No , uh ."
"[23:18] mn007 | Well p two network , one VAD and one feature net . Mm - hmm ."
"[23:20] mn052 | Oh , you already have it ?"
"[23:21] mn052 | OK , so just figure how to take the features"
[23:25] mn007 | Yeah .
[23:25] mn052 | OK .
[23:27] mn007 | Um .
"[23:27] mn007 | But , yeah , I think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net @ @ ."
[23:33] me006 | Feature net .
"[23:35] me018 | uh , the new part of the evaluation ,"
"[23:37] me018 | the , uh , Wall Street Journal part ?"
[23:39] me013 | Right .
[23:40] me013 | Right .
[23:41] me013 | Um .
[23:43] me013 | Have you ever ?
[23:43] me013 | Very good question .
"[23:45] me013 | Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ?"
[23:48] me018 | No .
[23:49] me018 | Not yet .
[23:50] me013 | Oh .
"[23:51] me013 | Well you you may be called upon to help ,"
"[23:53] me013 | uh , uh , on account of , uh ,"
"[23:56] me013 | all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary ."
[23:59] me018 | OK .
[24:01] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:01] me018 | So what how is the , uh , interaction supposed to happen ?"
"[24:04] me018 | Uh , I remember the last time we talked about this ,"
"[24:07] me018 | it was sort of up in the air whether they were going to be taking , uh ,"
[24:14] mn052 | Yeah .
[24:16] mn052 | Yeah .
"[24:16] me018 | Oh , so they 're gonna just deliver a system basically ."
"[24:18] mn052 | Yeah , yeah ."
[24:19] me013 | Do we already have it ?
"[24:20] mn052 | Yeah , th I I guess it 's almost ready ."
[24:22] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[24:24] mn052 | So they have released their , uh , document ,"
[24:28] mn052 | describing the system .
[24:29] me018 | I see .
"[24:30] me013 | Maybe you could , uh ,"
[24:34] mn052 | Sure .
[24:35] me018 | So we 'll have to grab this over CVS or something ?
"[24:37] mn052 | It - no , it 's just downloadable from their from their web site ."
[24:37] me018 | Is that how they do it ?
[24:39] me018 | OK .
[24:41] me018 | OK .
[24:47] me013 | if these guys are really focusing on
[24:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[25:00] me018 | Sure .
"[25:00] me013 | and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to ,"
"[25:04] me013 | uh ,"
"[25:05] me013 | tweak Joe about or whatever , because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff ."
[25:10] me018 | OK .
[25:16] mn052 | So I 'll point you to the web site and the mails corresponding .
[25:22] mn052 | So I
"[25:23] me018 | And it but it 's not ready yet , the system ?"
"[25:25] mn052 | I I think they are still , uh , tuning something on that ."
"[25:31] mn052 | So they 're like ,"
"[25:32] mn052 | d they 're varying different parameters like the insertion penalty and other stuff , and then seeing what 's the performance ."
[25:37] me018 | Are those going to be
"[25:38] me018 | parameters that are frozen , nobody can change ? Or ?"
"[25:41] mn052 | Uh , w I guess there is , uh , time during which people are gonna make suggestions ."
"[25:47] me018 | Oh , but everybody 's gonna have to use the same values ."
[25:49] mn052 | After that .
[25:50] me018 | Oh !
[25:50] me018 | Interesting . OK .
"[26:01] me013 | Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would"
[26:03] me013 | want to
[26:04] me013 | know about is whether
"[26:07] me013 | we get really hurt ,"
"[26:09] me013 | uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things ."
[26:12] me018 | Using our features . Yeah .
"[26:13] me013 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[26:15] me013 | Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or"
"[26:19] me013 | Hynek will need to ,"
[26:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:23] me013 | about this .
[26:26] me013 | Um .
"[26:26] me018 | And we may be able to revisit this idea about , you know , somehow modifying our features to"
"[26:34] me013 | Yes . In this case , that 's right ."
[26:36] me018 | Yeah .
[26:37] me013 | That 's right .
"[26:39] me013 | Um , some of that may be ,"
[26:46] me018 | Yeah .
[26:47] me013 | Uh .
"[26:48] me013 | But , um ."
"[26:52] me013 | Yeah , the other thing is that even though"
"[26:55] me013 | it 's months away ,"
"[26:56] me013 | uh ,"
[26:57] me013 | it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner .
"[27:01] me013 | And , um , if they haven't decided things like this ,"
"[27:06] me013 | like what the parameters are gonna be for this ,"
"[27:08] me013 | uh , when "" deciding "" is not just somebody deciding . I mean , in fact there should be some"
"[27:15] me013 | deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . It it it seems pretty tight to me ."
[27:20] me018 | So wha what 's the significance of November fifteenth ?
[27:22] me013 | That 's when the evaluation is .
[27:24] me018 | OK .
[27:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[27:26] me013 | So , yeah , so after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off ."
"[27:31] me013 | It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me . But , uh ,"
[27:46] me013 | Anyway .
[27:47] me018 | OK .
[27:51] me013 | Great .
"[27:58] me013 | who 's , uh , working with this and and"
"[28:01] me018 | Is is this part of the evaluation just a small part , or ho how important is this to the overall ?"
"[28:07] me013 | I I think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do ."
[28:13] me013 | Uh .
[28:13] mn052 | b
[28:14] me018 | This is one of those things that will be debated afterwards ?
"[28:19] me013 | my impression ,"
"[28:22] me013 | my impression is that , um ,"
[28:25] me013 | they want it as a double check .
[28:27] me013 | That you haven't come across you haven't
[28:29] me013 | invented features
[28:31] me013 | which are actually gonna do badly
"[28:33] me013 | for a a significantly different task ,"
[28:35] me013 | particularly one with larger vocabulary .
[28:37] me018 | Mmm .
"[28:37] me013 | And , um , but"
"[28:39] me013 | it 's not the main emphasis . I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary ."
[28:45] me018 | Mmm .
[28:46] me013 | So it 's it 's a double check . So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight .
"[28:50] me018 | Seems to me that if it 's a double check , they should give you a one or a zero ."
"[28:54] me018 | Y you passed the threshold or you didn't pass the threshold , and they shouldn't even"
[28:58] me018 | care about what the score is .
"[28:59] me013 | But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with . Uh , but"
[29:01] me018 | Yeah .
"[29:02] me013 | in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched ,"
"[29:09] me013 | uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched ,"
"[29:13] me013 | but it 's only a a marginal , right ? It 's like forty ,"
[29:19] mn052 | Yeah .
"[29:20] me013 | if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect ."
[29:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:26] me013 | And , um , it"
[29:32] me018 | Oh .
"[29:33] me013 | If it doesn't help you much ,"
"[29:35] me013 | uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data ,"
"[29:45] me013 | if it doesn't help you much at all ,"
"[29:47] me013 | um , or to put it another way , if it helps some people a lot more than it helps other people ,"
[29:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:53] me018 | So is this , uh ?"
"[29:56] me018 | Uh , Guenter was putting a bunch of Wall Street Journal data on our disks ."
[29:59] me013 | That 's it .
[30:00] me018 | So that 's the data that we 'll be running on ?
[30:02] me013 | Yeah .
[30:02] me018 | I see . OK .
[30:04] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:08] me013 | we have the data , just not the recognizer ."
[30:19] me013 | OK .
"[30:20] me018 | So this test may take quite a while to run , then ."
[30:24] me018 | May - judging by the amount of data that he was putting
"[30:26] me013 | Uh ,"
[30:27] me018 | on .
"[30:27] me013 | well there 's training and test , right ?"
"[30:32] me013 | No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's"
[30:34] me013 | data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it . So
[30:40] me018 | OK .
"[30:42] me013 | So , training the recognizer , but , um"
[30:47] me013 | Um .
[30:52] me013 | Is it trained on clean and and test on ?
[30:53] mn052 | The Wall Street ?
[30:54] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:55] mn007 | Apparently , no . It 's training on"
"[30:58] mn007 | a range between ten and twenty DB , I think , and testing between five and fifteen ."
[31:03] mn052 | Yeah .
[31:03] mn007 | That 's
[31:04] me013 | OK .
"[31:07] mn052 | It 's like a medium medium - mismatch condition , sort of ."
[31:10] me013 | I see .
"[31:19] mn007 | which are selected randomly and added randomly ,"
"[31:23] mn007 | uh , to the files ."
[31:30] mn007 | on TI - digits .
[31:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[31:39] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I wouldn't imagine that the amount of testing data"
[31:42] me013 | was
[31:44] me013 | that huge .
"[31:47] me013 | They probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too ."
[31:51] me013 | Maybe not .
[31:57] me013 | So .
[31:57] me013 | That 's that .
[31:59] me013 | Anybody have anything else ?
"[32:00] me018 | Uh , one one last question on that . When did they estimate that they would have that system available for download ?"
"[32:07] mn052 | Um ,"
[32:08] mn052 | I guess I guess one some preliminary version is already there .
"[32:12] me018 | Oh , so there 's w something you can download to just"
"[32:14] mn052 | Yeah , it 's already there . Yeah ."
"[32:15] me018 | learn ? OK , good ."
[32:15] mn052 | But they 're
"[32:16] mn052 | actually parallel - y doing some modifications also , I think ."
[32:19] me018 | OK .
"[32:20] mn052 | So I guess the f final system will be frozen by middle of ,"
"[32:23] mn052 | like , one more week maybe ."
"[32:27] me013 | Oh , well that 's pretty soon ."
"[32:28] mn052 | Yeah , that 's just one more ."
"[32:31] me006 | Is this their , um , SVM recognizer ?"
"[32:34] mn052 | No , it 's just a straightforward HMM ."
"[32:36] me006 | Oh , OK ."
"[32:40] me013 | in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing ."
[32:41] me006 | Uh - huh .
[32:45] me013 | For the most part it 's it 's Gaussian mixtures .
"[32:45] me006 | Oh , OK ."
"[32:47] me006 | Oh , OK ."
[32:48] me013 | Yeah .
"[32:48] mn052 | It 's just a HMM , Gaussian mixture model ."
[32:50] me006 | Gaussian mixture HMM . OK .
[32:51] me013 | Yeah .
"[32:52] me013 | Yeah , the SVM thing was an HMM also . It was just a it it it was like a hybrid , like what ? Yeah ."
"[32:55] mn052 | Yeah , this is a g yeah , this i yeah ."
[32:55] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:57] me018 | So , just so that I understand , they 're providing scripts and everything so that"
"[33:01] me018 | basically , uh ,"
"[33:03] me018 | you you push a button and it does training , and then it does test , and everything ?"
[33:08] me018 | Is that the idea ?
"[33:09] mn052 | I I I think yeah , I I guess something like that ."
[33:12] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[33:16] me018 | I see . Hmm .
[33:21] me018 | Somehow yo there 's hooks to put your
"[33:21] mn052 | Just , ju"
"[33:22] mn052 | Yeah , I th I think ."
[33:25] me018 | Hmm .
[33:27] me013 | Hmm .
"[33:33] me013 | In fact , I mean , if you look into it a little bit , it might be reasonable You know Joe , right ?"
[33:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:39] me013 | Yeah . Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um ,"
"[33:44] me013 | different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on . So that ,"
"[33:50] me013 | you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors and what 's what 's the plan about that ?"
[33:58] me018 | OK .
"[34:00] mn052 | So sh shall we , like , add Chuck also to the mailing lists ?"
[34:07] me013 | Yeah . Is that OK ?
[34:07] mn052 | Because there 's a mailing list for this .
"[34:09] me018 | Yeah , that 'd be great ."
"[34:10] mn052 | Yeah , I guess maybe Hari or Hynek ,"
"[34:12] mn052 | one of them , has to send a mail to Joe ."
[34:17] me018 | I I could send him an email .
"[34:18] mn052 | Well , yeah , to add or maybe wh"
"[34:23] me013 | Uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see . Do you have Hari 's , uh ?"
"[34:28] me013 | Yeah , so maybe just CC Hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here ,"
[34:33] me018 | OK .
"[34:33] me013 | and , uh , you know , end ."
[34:35] me018 | Would it be better if I asked Hari to ask Joe ?
[34:37] me013 | Uh .
"[34:40] me013 | Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , "" Hari , hopefully this is OK with you "" ."
[34:43] me018 | OK .
[34:45] me018 | OK .
"[34:46] me013 | And then if Joe feels like he needs a confirmation , Hari can answer it ."
[34:46] mn052 | Yeah .
"[34:51] me013 | That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still ,"
[35:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[35:05] mn052 | And there is an , uh , archive of all the mails that has been"
"[35:10] mn052 | gon that has gone , uh , between these people among these people ."
[35:14] me018 | OK .
[35:17] mn052 | mails in the ISIP web site Mississippi web site .
[35:19] me018 | OK .
[35:20] me018 | Is that a password controlled ? OK .
"[35:21] mn052 | Yeah , it 's password protected ."
[35:44] me013 | Have you thought about how long would be
"[35:48] me013 | uh , most useful for you to go up to OGI ?"
"[35:59] mn007 | For September , we can set up"
[36:03] mn007 | a work schedule and we can maybe work independently .
[36:06] mn007 | And then at some point it maybe be better to
[36:12] mn007 | work together again .
"[36:14] me013 | Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ? I mean , it 's to you . I ju you guys are"
"[36:19] mn007 | Maybe , yeah ."
[36:23] mn007 | Huh .
[36:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:26] me013 | the best way to work it . I 'll support it either way , so ."
[36:29] mn007 | Mm - hmm
[36:30] mn007 | Right .
[36:33] me013 | OK .
[36:35] me013 | Uh .
[36:37] me013 | Got anything to tell us ?
[36:39] me006 | Um .
"[36:40] me006 | Well , I 've been"
[36:42] me006 | reading some literature about
[36:44] me006 | clustering
"[36:45] me006 | of data . Just , um ,"
"[36:50] me006 | OK , so we 're talking about"
[36:53] me006 | discovering intermediate categories
[36:57] me006 | to classify .
"[36:58] me006 | And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that ,"
"[37:01] me006 | uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things . So"
"[37:05] me006 | she has , um she has"
"[37:08] me006 | temporal patterns for ,"
"[37:10] me006 | um , a certain set of phonemes ,"
"[37:13] me006 | from from TIMIT , right ?"
"[37:14] me006 | the most common phonemes . And each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window ."
[37:23] me006 | And it has has these patterns .
"[37:25] me006 | Um , so she has , um"
"[37:29] me006 | a TRAP for each one of the phonemes ,"
"[37:32] me006 | um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands ."
"[37:36] me006 | And , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering"
"[37:42] me006 | which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data ."
[38:07] me006 | by merging the patterns that are most closely related .
[38:13] me018 | And you create a tree .
"[38:14] me006 | And y yeah , yeah , a dendrogram tree ."
[38:17] me006 | Um .
"[38:17] me018 | And then you can pick , uh , values anywhere along that tree to"
[38:22] me018 | fix your set of clusters .
"[38:27] me006 | when the sol similarity measures ,"
"[38:29] me006 | um , don't go down as much ."
"[38:32] me006 | And so , uh so you stop at that point ."
"[38:36] me006 | And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad ,"
"[38:41] me006 | um broad categories ,"
"[38:43] me006 | uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops ."
"[38:53] me006 | And , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds ."
"[38:58] me006 | Um , and ,"
"[39:07] me006 | it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering ,"
[39:16] me006 | that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme .
[39:24] me006 | to the set of phonemes that you already have .
"[39:27] me006 | Um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time ,"
[39:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[39:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:42] me006 | if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm"
"[39:49] me006 | find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point ."
"[39:57] me006 | Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify ."
[40:11] me013 | Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?
[40:11] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:13] me006 | Um ,"
[40:14] me006 | right .
"[40:16] me013 | Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using , right ?"
"[40:18] me006 | Yeah , yeah . I I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that but , uh ,"
[40:39] me006 | Yeah .
[40:43] me006 | OK .
"[40:52] me013 | uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands ,"
[40:55] me013 | then
[40:57] me013 | what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .
[41:02] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[41:03] me013 | That that seems to be kind of fundamental to it .
[41:06] me006 | Right .
"[41:06] me013 | Um , and then the other thing ,"
"[41:10] me013 | that I wonder about with it ,"
"[41:11] me013 | and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything ,"
"[41:17] me013 | Um , just wondering really ."
[41:19] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:20] me013 | Um ,"
[41:21] me013 | the sort of standard
"[41:33] me013 | um , and your goal is discrimination ,"
"[41:37] me013 | then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things ,"
"[41:45] me013 | um , is actually better ."
"[41:47] me013 | Um , and I don't know if that I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness ,"
"[41:52] me013 | you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but"
"[41:54] me013 | it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about . Because , for instance ,"
"[41:58] me013 | you can imagine ,"
"[41:59] me013 | uh ,"
"[42:01] me013 | uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , "" buh "" and "" puh "" differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration ."
[42:13] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:13] me013 | I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics ."
"[42:20] me013 | if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together ."
[42:34] me013 | screwing up on this distinction .
"[42:37] me013 | So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work ."
[42:42] me013 | And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like .
"[42:46] me013 | And since they sort of work ,"
"[42:48] me013 | uh , it means that they are already doing if you go and take"
"[42:52] me013 | any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , "" how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? """
[43:01] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:01] me013 | Boy , I bet they 're all doing"
"[43:03] me013 | nearly perfectly on this , right ? So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do ."
[43:04] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:13] me013 | So , what are we bringing to the party ? I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise ,"
"[43:19] me013 | uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another ,"
"[43:26] me013 | and hence , would probably be clustered together ."
[43:29] me006 | Mmm .
"[43:29] me013 | So that 's th that 's the hard thing . I mean , I understand that there 's this other"
"[43:33] me013 | constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation ."
[43:41] me013 | And it 's something that you really think you can pick up . But
[43:44] me013 | I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions
[43:49] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:50] me013 | that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions ."
"[44:02] me013 | So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it ."
"[44:09] me013 | Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?"
"[44:13] me013 | I mean , they 're the same sort of thing . They 're both orthogonalizing . But ,"
[44:14] me006 | Right .
"[44:16] me013 | you know and and , um ,"
[44:19] me013 | this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves .
"[44:26] me013 | Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think on yourself . Uh . So , uh Um , anyway ."
[44:39] me013 | That 's my thought .
[44:41] me006 | OK .
[44:48] me018 | Yeah .
"[44:48] me013 | W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot . And you 've been thinking about it more now , these categories . Mm - hmm ."
[44:53] mn052 | Yeah .
[45:04] me018 | the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . But
"[45:10] me018 | it seems to me that the desire the desirable feature to have is something that , um ,"
"[45:17] me018 | is bottom - up . You know , however we do that . And"
[45:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[45:22] me018 | and so
[45:23] me018 | I guess what I don't understand is how to do that
"[45:26] me018 | and still be discriminative , because to be discriminative you have to have categories"
[45:28] me013 | Right .
"[45:31] me018 | and the only categories that we know of to use are sort of these human human sig significant categories that are significant to humans , like phonemes , things like that . But that 's sort of what you want to avoid . And so"
"[45:44] me013 | Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh"
[45:44] me018 | that feels I don't know how to get out of this .
"[45:51] me013 | um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense ,"
"[45:58] me013 | uh ,"
[46:01] me013 | are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them .
"[46:06] me013 | Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward"
"[46:12] me013 | for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly ."
[46:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:17] me013 | So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning , right ?"
[46:24] me018 | Right .
"[46:26] me018 | So the question is , how far down ?"
"[46:28] me018 | We could stop at words , but we don't , right ? We go all the way down to phonemes ."
"[46:32] me013 | Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes ."
[46:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:39] me013 | You know , and and and i it 's almost like you want categories if if our if our , uh , um ,"
"[46:54] me013 | then , um , maybe we should be looking at words ."
[46:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:58] me013 | I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties , but"
"[47:05] me013 | i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w"
[47:12] me018 | Yeah .
"[47:17] me018 | Yeah , so the common right , the common wisdom is you can't do words because there 's too many of them , right ? So you have to have some smaller set that you can"
"[47:25] me018 | use , uh ,"
"[47:38] me018 | are really cartoon - ish , right ? So when you look at conversational speech , for example , you don't see the phonemes that you that you have in your word models ."
[47:40] me013 | Yeah .
[47:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:59] me013 | for later stuff , uh ,"
[48:01] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[48:02] me013 | then maybe it doesn't matter
"[48:06] me013 | I mean ,"
[48:08] me013 | what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition .
[48:13] me018 | Right .
[48:14] me018 | Right .
"[48:15] me013 | And and somehow if that 's built into the loop of what the categories I mean , we do this every day"
[48:18] me018 | Ah .
[48:20] me013 | in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate .
[48:21] me018 | Right .
[48:27] me018 | Yeah .
[48:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[48:38] me013 | the final goal .
[48:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:40] me013 | Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way , where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit ,"
[48:43] me018 | Right .
[48:52] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[48:53] me013 | uh , and"
"[48:55] me013 | uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever , but you sort of don't worry about that ,"
[49:01] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:02] me013 | and just somehow feed it back through . You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it . But I mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it"
"[49:11] me018 | No , but I think the important part in there is that , you know , if you want to be discriminative , you have to have"
"[49:16] me018 | uh , you know , categories ."
[49:19] me013 | Right .
"[49:19] me018 | And I think this the important categories are the words ,"
[49:23] me013 | Yeah .
[49:23] me018 | and not the phones .
[49:26] me013 | Yeah .
"[49:39] me013 | Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i"
"[49:45] me013 | Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true ."
[49:48] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:49] me013 | If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT ,"
[49:53] me018 | Yeah .
"[49:59] me018 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[50:04] me013 | to do that , to put in discrimination at that level ."
[50:20] me018 | Mmm .
"[50:24] me018 | So it 's almost like there 's this mechanism that we have that , you know , when when we 're hearing read speech and all the phonemes are there"
"[50:32] me018 | you know , we we deal with that , but but when we go to conversational , and then all of a sudden"
"[50:38] me018 | not all the phonemes are there , it doesn't really matter that much to us as humans because we have some kind of mechanism that allows for"
"[50:47] me018 | these word models , whatever those models are , to be munged , you know , and and it doesn't really hurt , and"
[51:00] me018 | I 'm not sure how how to build that in .
[51:04] me018 | Uh .
"[51:08] me013 | Yeah , I mean , I guess the other thing i is is to think of a little bit I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive , but start looking at"
"[51:22] me013 | um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say ,"
"[51:33] me013 | uh , when there is noise ."
"[51:37] me013 | You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ? Or is it cor you know , is it ? I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh ,"
[51:40] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:47] me013 | you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones ."
"[51:57] me013 | And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen . But , um ,"
[52:06] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[52:15] me018 | I think part of the difficulty is that a l a lot of the robustness that we have is probably
"[52:21] me018 | coming from a much higher level . You know , we understand the context of the situation when we 're having a conversation . And so if there 's noise in there , you know , our brain fills in and imagines what what should be there ."
[52:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:34] me018 | Yeah , exactly ."
"[52:35] me013 | Oh , sure , that 's really big . Uh , but I mean , even if you do"
[52:36] me006 | Yeah .
"[52:40] me013 | um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise"
"[52:50] me013 | than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are ."
[52:56] me018 | Hmm .
"[52:57] me013 | So , I mean , that 's i"
[53:07] me013 | Uh .
[53:23] me018 | Yeah .
"[53:30] me018 | Go ahead , Morgan ."
[56:46] me013 | OK .
[56:47] me018 | OK .

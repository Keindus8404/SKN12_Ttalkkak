[00:00] me013 | Let 's see . Test ?
[00:01] me013 | Test ? Yeah . OK .
[00:02] mn007 | Channel one .
[00:02] me006 | Hello ?
[00:03] me006 | Hello ?
[00:08] fn002 | Test .
"[00:15] me013 | uh , through Saturday , and , um ,"
"[00:18] me013 | I won't be here Thursday and Friday . But my suggestion is that , uh ,"
"[00:23] me013 | at least for this meeting , people should go ahead , uh , cuz Hynek will be here , and ,"
[00:32] me018 | OK .
[00:35] me013 | Um .
"[00:48] me018 | I don't really have , uh , anything new ."
[00:52] me018 | Been working on Meeting Recorder stuff . So .
[00:55] me013 | OK .
"[00:58] me013 | Do you think that would be the case for next week also ? Or is is , uh ? What 's your"
[01:05] me013 | projection
[01:06] me013 | on ?
[01:08] me018 | Um .
"[01:18] me013 | is , um ,"
"[01:20] me013 | adjusting the , uh , sca the scaling and , uh , insertion penalty sorta stuff ."
"[01:26] me018 | I did play with that , actually , a little bit ."
"[01:28] me018 | Um . What happens is , uh , when you get to the noisy stuff , you start getting lots of insertions ."
[01:34] me013 | Right .
"[01:35] me018 | And , um ,"
"[01:37] me018 | so I 've tried playing around a little bit with , um ,"
[01:40] me018 | the insertion penalties and things like that .
[01:42] me013 | Yeah .
[01:42] me018 | Um .
"[01:43] me018 | I mean , it it didn't make a whole lot of difference . Like for the well - matched case , it seemed"
[01:48] me018 | like it was pretty good .
"[01:49] me018 | Um . I could do more playing with that , though ."
[01:54] me018 | and see .
[01:54] me013 | But you were looking at mel cepstrum .
[01:57] me018 | Yes .
[01:58] me013 | Right .
"[02:02] me013 | Right . So , I mean , i it it 's not the direction that you were working with that we were saying"
"[02:06] me013 | what 's the uh , what 's the best you can do with with mel cepstrum ."
[02:10] me018 | Mmm .
"[02:10] me013 | But ,"
"[02:11] me013 | they raised a very valid point ,"
"[02:13] me013 | which , I guess So , to first order I mean , you have other things you were gonna do ,"
"[02:17] me013 | but to first order , I would say that the conclusion is"
"[02:20] me013 | that if you , um ,"
"[02:22] me013 | do , uh , some monkeying around with , uh , the exact"
[02:27] me013 | HTK training
"[02:29] me013 | and @ @ with , uh , you know , how many states and so forth ,"
"[02:33] me013 | that it it doesn't particularly improve the performance . In other words ,"
"[02:37] me013 | that even though it sounds pretty dumb ,"
"[02:40] me013 | just applying the same number of states to everything , more or less , no matter what language , isn't so bad ."
[02:46] me013 | Right ?
"[02:47] me013 | And I guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of Gaussians ,"
[02:50] me018 | Right .
"[02:51] me013 | but , um ,"
[02:53] me013 | let 's just If we had to if we had to
"[02:55] me013 | draw a conclusion on the information we have so far , we 'd say something like that . Right ?"
[02:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:00] me013 | Uh , so the next question to ask , which is I think the one that that that Andreas was dre addressing himself to in the lunch meeting ,"
"[03:07] me013 | is ,"
"[03:08] me013 | um ,"
"[03:09] me013 | we 're not supposed to adjust the back - end ,"
[03:11] me013 | but anybody using the system would .
[03:14] me018 | Yeah .
"[03:15] me013 | So ,"
"[03:16] me013 | if you were just adjusting the back - end ,"
"[03:19] me013 | how much better would you do , uh , in noise ?"
"[03:23] me013 | Uh , because"
[03:24] me013 | the language scaling and insertion penalties and so forth are probably set to be about right for mel cepstrum .
[03:30] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:31] me013 | But ,"
"[03:32] me013 | um ,"
[03:33] me013 | they 're probably not at all set right
"[03:36] me013 | for these things , particularly these things that look over , uh , larger time windows , in one way or another with with LDA and KLT and neural nets and"
[03:45] me013 | all these things .
[03:46] me013 | In the fa past we 've always found that we had to increase the insertion penalty to to correspond to such things .
"[03:53] me013 | So ,"
"[03:54] me013 | I think that 's , uh , @ @ that 's kind of a first - order thing that that we should try ."
"[04:00] me018 | so the experiment is to , um ,"
"[04:03] me018 | run our front - end like normal , with the default , uh ,"
"[04:07] me018 | insertion penalties and so forth ,"
[04:08] me018 | and then
[04:10] me018 | tweak that a little bit and see how much of a difference it makes
"[04:13] me013 | So by "" our front - end "" I mean take , you know , the Aurora - two s take some version that Stephane has that is ,"
[04:18] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:19] me013 | you know , our current best version of something ."
[04:22] me013 | Um .
"[04:24] me013 | I mean , y don't wanna do this over a hundred different things that they 've tried but , you know , for"
[04:29] me013 | some version that you say is a good one . You know ? Um .
"[04:34] me013 | how much ,"
"[04:36] me013 | uh , does it improve if you actually adjust that ?"
[04:44] me018 | OK .
[04:45] me013 | But it is interesting . You say you you have for the noisy How about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium
[04:52] me013 | mismatched conditions ? Have you ?
"[04:54] me013 | When you adjusted those numbers for mel cepstrum , did it ?"
"[04:59] me018 | Uh , I I don't remember off the top of my head ."
[05:02] me018 | Um .
[05:05] me018 | Yeah . I didn't even write them down .
"[05:07] me018 | I I I don't remember . I would need to Well , I did write down ,"
"[05:14] me018 | So , when I was doing I just wrote down some numbers for the well - matched case ."
[05:18] me013 | Yeah .
[05:19] me018 | Um .
"[05:20] me018 | Looking at the I wrote down what the deletions , substitutions , and insertions were ,"
"[05:25] me018 | uh ,"
[05:25] me018 | for different numbers of states per phone .
[05:28] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:29] me018 | Um , but , uh , that that 's all I wrote down ."
[05:33] me013 | OK .
[05:33] me018 | So . I I would Yeah . I would need to do that .
[05:38] me018 | I can do that for next week .
[05:39] me013 | Yeah .
[05:50] me013 | but I think it would be it 'd be good to know that .
[05:51] me018 | OK .
"[05:55] me018 | front - end , uh , stuff from you or you point me to some files that you 've already calculated ."
[05:56] mn007 | Hmm .
[05:58] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:59] mn007 | Alright .
[06:01] me013 | OK .
[06:03] me013 | Uh .
[06:12] me018 | I probably will have time to do that and
[06:14] me018 | time to play a little bit with the silence
[06:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:17] me018 | model .
[06:18] me018 | So maybe I can have that for next week when Hynek 's here .
[06:21] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:29] me013 | That , in fact , might have been"
[06:36] me013 | at least part of it that that we were seeing . Remember we were seeing the SRI system was so much better than the tandem system .
[06:42] me018 | Hmm .
"[06:43] me013 | Part of it might just be that the SRI system , they they they always adjust"
[06:48] me018 | Is there ?
[06:50] me018 | I wonder if there 's anything that we could do to the front - end
[06:56] me013 | Yes . I think you can .
[06:59] me018 | What could you do ?
"[07:02] me013 | uh ,"
"[07:04] me013 | part of what 's going on ,"
"[07:06] me013 | um , is the , uh , the range"
[07:10] me013 | of values .
"[07:13] me013 | So , if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range ,"
[07:18] me018 | Oh .
[07:19] me013 | and taking the appropriate root .
[07:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:22] me013 | You know ? If something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together ,"
"[07:28] me013 | you can take a root of some sort . If it 's like seven probabilities together , you can take the seventh root of it or something , or if it 's in the log domain , divide it by seven ."
[07:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:36] me013 | but ,"
"[07:37] me013 | um ,"
[07:38] me013 | that has a similar effect
[07:41] me013 | because it changes the scale
[07:43] me013 | of the numbers of the differences between different candidates from the acoustic model
"[07:46] me018 | Oh , right . So that w Right . So , in effect ,"
[07:48] me013 | as opposed to what 's coming from the language model .
[07:50] me018 | that 's
[07:52] me018 | changing the value of your insertion penalty .
"[07:54] me013 | Yeah . I mean , it 's more directly like the the language scaling or the , uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling ,"
[07:56] me018 | That 's interesting .
[08:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[08:06] me018 | Right .
"[08:08] me018 | So if we know what the insertion penalty is , then we can get an idea"
"[08:13] me018 | about what range our number should be in , so that they match with that ."
[08:15] me013 | I think so . Yeah .
[08:17] me013 | Yeah . So that 's why I think
[08:18] me013 | that 's another reason other than curiosity as to why i it would in fact
[08:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:26] me013 | I mean , the other thing is , are aren't we seeing ? Y y I 'm sure you 've already looked at this bu in these noisy cases , are ? We are seeing lots of insertions . Right ? The insertion number is quite high ?"
[08:35] mn007 | Yeah .
[08:35] me018 | Yeah .
[08:37] mn007 | Yeah .
[08:43] mn007 | when the front - end is more robust .
[08:46] mn007 | Yeah . I could look at it at this . Yeah .
[08:49] me013 | Yeah . Wha - what 's a typical number ?
[08:49] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:51] mn007 | I don't I don't know .
"[08:51] me013 | Do we ? Oh , you oh , you don't know . OK ."
[08:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[08:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:10] me013 | tend to be on the small side comparing to to , uh , substitutions ."
"[09:13] me018 | Well , this the whole"
"[09:15] me018 | problem with insertions was what I think ,"
"[09:18] me018 | um , we talked about when"
[09:23] me018 | and that
"[09:24] me018 | was when people were saying , well we should have a , uh ,"
[09:29] me013 | Right .
"[09:30] me018 | that , because all that stuff that we 're getting thr the silence that 's getting through is causing insertions . So ."
[09:35] me013 | Right .
"[09:40] me013 | Yeah . And it may be less of a critical thing . I mean , the fact that some get by may be less of a critical thing if you ,"
"[09:47] me013 | uh , get things in the right range ."
[09:48] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:49] me013 | So , I mean , the insertions is is a symptom ."
"[09:52] me013 | It 's a symptom that there 's something , uh , wrong with the range ."
[09:52] me018 | Right .
"[09:55] me013 | But there 's uh , your your your substitutions tend to go up as well . So , uh , I I I think that ,"
[09:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[10:05] me013 | um .
"[10:09] me013 | I mean , that 's why just in general , if you"
"[10:12] me013 | change what these these penalties and scaling factors are , you reach some point that 's a that 's a minimum . So ."
[10:20] me013 | Um .
"[10:22] me013 | We do have to do well over a range of different conditions , some of which are noisier than others . Um ."
[10:35] me013 | it 's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range
"[10:40] me013 | of these features ,"
"[10:41] me013 | it , um ,"
"[10:44] me013 | uh ,"
"[10:58] me013 | and it 's ar artificial here that we 're not adjusting those ,"
[11:03] me018 | Hmm .
"[11:07] me013 | I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built , that"
[11:11] me013 | we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a
[11:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:19] me013 | for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit . But ,"
"[11:27] me013 | Uh , we might just not even be in the right operating range ."
"[11:30] me018 | So , would the ?"
"[11:33] me018 | Uh , would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well - matched case ?"
"[11:37] me018 | So , if we computed what the range was in well - matched ,"
[11:40] me018 | and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it
[11:43] me018 | have the same range as ?
[11:44] me013 | No . You don't wanna change it for different conditions .
"[11:52] me018 | Oh , I wasn't suggesting change it for different conditions . I was just saying that"
"[11:56] me018 | when we pick a range , we we wanna pick a range that we map our numbers into we should probably pick it based on"
[12:00] me013 | Yeah .
[12:02] me018 | the range that we get in the well - matched case .
"[12:06] me018 | Otherwise , I mean , what range are we gonna"
[12:09] me018 | choose
[12:11] me018 | to to map everything into ?
[12:12] me013 | Well . It depends how much we wanna
"[12:14] me013 | do gamesmanship and how much we wanna do I mean , i if he"
"[12:19] me013 | it to me , actually , even if you wanna be play on the gamesmanship side , it can be kinda tricky . So , I mean ,"
"[12:25] me013 | what you would do is set the set the scaling factors , uh ,"
"[12:31] me013 | so that you got the best number for this point four five times the you know , and so on ."
[12:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:37] me013 | But they might change that those weightings .
[12:39] me018 | Yeah .
[12:43] me013 | I just sorta think we need to explore the space .
[12:45] me013 | Just take a look at it a little bit . And we we we may just find that that we 're way off .
[12:46] me018 | OK .
[12:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:50] me013 | Maybe we 're not .
"[12:51] me013 | You know ? As for these other things , it may turn out that , uh ,"
"[12:57] me013 | I mean , Andreas gave"
[13:04] me013 | people within this tight - knit community who are doing this evaluation
[13:11] me018 | Yeah .
"[13:12] me013 | But , people outside of it who look in at the broader picture are certainly gonna say"
"[13:16] me013 | "" Well , wait a minute . You 're doing all this standing on your head , uh , on the front - end , when all you could do is"
"[13:21] me013 | just adjust this in the back - end with one s one knob . "" And"
[13:23] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:25] me013 | so we have to at least ,"
"[13:26] me013 | I think , determine"
"[13:28] me013 | that that 's not true ,"
"[13:30] me013 | which would be OK ,"
"[13:31] me013 | or determine that it is true , in which case we want to adjust that and then"
[13:37] me018 | Right .
"[13:44] me013 | also then becomes a priority for this particular test ,"
[13:48] me013 | and saying you don't have to do that .
[13:54] me013 | OK .
[13:59] me013 | What 's new with you ?
[14:06] mn007 | Um .
[14:17] mn007 | Mmm .
"[14:22] mn007 | Well , so we 've been mainly working on the report and and Yeah ."
[14:26] me018 | Mainly working on what ?
[14:27] mn007 | On the report of the work that was already
[14:28] me018 | Oh .
[14:31] mn007 | done .
[14:33] mn007 | Um .
[14:35] me018 | How about that ?
"[14:36] me018 | Any - anything new on the thing that ,"
"[14:39] me018 | uh , you were working on with the , uh ?"
[14:43] me018 | No results ? Yeah .
[14:48] me013 | What was that ?
[14:52] me018 | voicing detector .
"[14:56] me013 | I mean , what what 's what 's going on now ? What are you doing ?"
"[14:59] fn002 | Uh , to try to found , nnn , robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice ."
[15:07] fn002 | And we w
[15:12] fn002 | of the es difference between the FFT spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum .
[15:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[15:20] fn002 | Uh , also the another parameter is relates with the auto - correlation function ."
[15:26] me013 | Uh - huh .
[15:26] fn002 | R - ze energy and the variance a also of the auto - correlation function .
[15:31] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[15:33] me013 | So , that 's Yeah . That 's what you were describing , I guess , a week or two ago . So ."
[15:41] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[15:44] me013 | So you 're training neural networks now ?
"[15:46] fn002 | No , not yet ."
[15:53] me013 | Uh - huh .
[16:01] fn002 | to give some more structure .
"[16:03] me013 | So . B So Yeah . I if I can summarize , basically what 's going on is that you 're going over a lot of material that you have generated in"
[16:03] mn007 | Yea -
"[16:12] me013 | furious fashion , f generating many results and doing many experiments and trying to pull it together into some coherent"
[16:17] fn002 | Hm - hmm .
[16:18] me013 | form to be able to
[16:20] me013 | see wha see what happens . Yes ?
"[16:20] mn007 | Uh , y yeah . Basically we we 've stopped ,"
"[16:23] mn007 | uh , experimenting , I mean . We 're just writing some kind of technical report ."
"[16:29] me018 | Is this a report that 's for Aurora ? Or is it just like a tech report for ICSI , or ?"
[16:32] fn002 | No .
[16:34] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:34] fn002 | For ICSI .
[16:35] me018 | Ah . I see .
[16:36] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:37] fn002 | Just summary of the experiment and the conclusion and
[16:41] me013 | Yeah .
[16:42] me013 | OK .
[16:46] me013 | you not necessarily finish that .
"[16:53] me013 | you 've got a clearer structure to it . You know what things are , you have things documented , you 've looked things up that you"
"[16:59] me013 | needed to look up . So that , you know so that such a thing can be written ."
[17:05] me013 | When when when do you leave again ?
"[17:08] fn002 | Uh , in July . First of July ."
[17:11] me013 | First of July ? OK .
[17:12] me013 | And that you figure on
[17:15] me013 | actually finishing it
[17:17] me013 | in in June .
[17:21] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:23] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[17:23] me013 | And right now it 's kind of important that we actually
"[17:28] me013 | go forward with experiments . So so , I I think it 's good to pause ,"
"[17:32] me013 | and to gather everything together and make sure it 's in good shape , so that other people can get access to it and so that it can go into a report in June . But I think"
"[17:40] me013 | to to really work on on fine - tuning the report n at this point is is probably bad timing ,"
[17:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:46] me013 | I I think .
[17:48] mn007 | Yeah .
"[17:49] mn007 | we just planned to work on it one week on this report , not no more , anyway ."
[17:54] mn007 | Um .
[17:56] mn007 | Yeah .
[17:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[17:59] mn007 | Mmm .
[18:00] me013 | There 's more to go ?
"[18:02] mn007 | Yeah . Well ,"
"[18:09] me018 | Are you discovering anything , uh ,"
"[18:12] me018 | that makes you scratch your head as you write this report , like why did we do that , or"
"[18:16] me018 | why didn't we do this , or ?"
[18:16] mn007 | Uh .
[18:18] mn007 | Yeah .
"[18:22] mn007 | Actually , there were some tables that were"
[18:25] mn007 | also
"[18:26] mn007 | with partial results . We just noticed that ,"
[18:30] mn007 | wh while gathering the result that
[18:33] mn007 | for some conditions we didn't have everything .
[18:35] me018 | Mmm .
[18:38] mn007 | Um .
"[18:39] mn007 | Yeah , yeah . We have , yeah , extracted actually the noises from the SpeechDat - Car ."
"[18:44] mn007 | And so ,"
[18:45] mn007 | we can train neural network
[18:48] mn007 | with speech and these noises .
[18:51] mn007 | Um .
"[18:54] mn007 | It 's difficult to say what it will give , because when we look at"
"[18:59] mn007 | the Aurora the TI - digits experiments ,"
"[19:02] mn007 | um ,"
"[19:04] mn007 | they have these three conditions that have different noises , and"
[19:07] mn007 | apparently this system perform as well
[19:10] mn007 | on the seen noises on the unseen noises and
[19:13] mn007 | on the seen noises .
"[19:14] mn007 | But ,"
[19:21] mn007 | from the SpeechDat - Car .
[19:23] mn007 | Um .
[19:28] mn007 | @ @
[19:31] me013 | that 's permitted ?
"[19:38] mn007 | Uh . Well ,"
[19:40] mn007 | OGI does did that .
[19:42] mn007 | Um .
[19:45] mn007 | At some point they did that for for the
[19:48] mn007 | voice
"[19:49] fn002 | Uh , for a v VAD ."
[19:49] mn007 | activity detector . Right ?
[19:55] me018 | Could you say it again ? What what exactly did they do ?
"[19:59] mn007 | They used some parts of the , um , Italian database to train the voice activity detector , I think ."
"[20:19] me013 | no , Italian and the Finnish"
[20:23] me013 | were development data
"[20:25] mn007 | Yeah . And Spanish , yeah ."
[20:25] me013 | on which you could adjust things .
[20:30] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[20:32] me013 | And then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything .
"[20:39] me013 | Uh , and it is true that the performance , uh ,"
[20:44] me013 | on the German
"[20:46] me013 | was I mean , even though the improvement wasn't so good , the pre the raw performance was really pretty good ."
[20:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:51] me013 | So And , uh ,"
"[20:54] me013 | it it doesn't appear that there 's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages ,"
[21:01] me013 | that that going to a different language really
"[21:04] me013 | hurt you . And the noises were not exactly the same . Right ? Because it was taken from a different ,"
[21:11] me013 | I mean they were different
[21:12] mn007 | Different cars . Yeah .
"[21:13] me013 | drives . I mean , it was it was actual different cars and so on . So ."
[21:14] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:20] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:22] me013 | You 'd really like to have something that
"[21:23] me013 | needed no particular noise at all , maybe just some white noise or something like that a at most ."
[21:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:30] me013 | But that 's not really what this contest is . So .
"[21:34] me013 | Um , I guess it 's OK ."
[21:36] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:37] me013 | That 's something I 'd like to understand before we
"[21:44] me018 | you know , the , uh , experiment designers didn't"
"[21:48] me018 | really think about , because I think most people aren't doing"
"[21:51] me018 | trained systems , or , you know , uh ,"
[22:00] me018 | doing signal - processing . So .
[22:02] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:06] me013 | and then they designed the things for Aurora - two knowing that we were doing that .
[22:06] me018 | Yeah .
[22:09] me018 | That 's true .
[22:10] me013 | Um .
[22:11] me018 | And they didn't forbid us right ? to build
[22:14] me018 | models on the data ?
[22:15] me013 | No .
"[22:18] me013 | it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on Italian ,"
"[22:22] me013 | uh , data and then , uh , we tested on Danish data and it did terribly ,"
"[22:27] me013 | uh , that that it would look bad . And I think someone would notice and would say "" Well , look . This is not generalizing . "" I would hope tha I would hope they would ."
"[22:40] me013 | But , uh ,"
"[22:41] me013 | it 's true . You know , maybe there 's parameters"
[22:43] me013 | that
"[22:54] me013 | Especially if you talk with him when I 'm not here , that 's a topic you should discuss with Hynek to , you know , double check it 's OK ."
[22:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:58] me018 | Do we know anything about the speakers for each of the , uh , training utterances ?"
[23:06] me018 | Do you have speaker information ?
"[23:12] mn007 | Like , we have male , female ,"
[23:12] fn002 | Hmm .
[23:15] me018 | Just male f female ?
[23:15] mn007 | at least .
[23:17] mn007 | Mmm .
[23:18] me013 | What kind of information do you mean ?
"[23:24] me018 | you know , gender - specific"
"[23:26] me018 | nets and , uh , vocal tract length normalization ."
[23:29] me018 | Things like that . I d I don't I didn't know what information we have about the speakers that we could try to take advantage of .
[23:32] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[23:38] me013 | Uh .
"[23:40] me013 | Right . I mean , again , i if you had the whole system you were optimizing , that would be easy to see . But if you 're"
"[23:46] me013 | supposedly just using a fixed back - end and you 're just coming up with a feature vector ,"
[23:59] me013 | Suppose you detected
"[24:04] me018 | Well , you could put them both in as separate"
[24:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:11] me013 | Maybe .
[24:16] me018 | I don't know . I was just
[24:17] me018 | wondering if there was other information we could exploit .
[24:24] me013 | Hmm .
"[24:33] me013 | Yeah , it 's an interesting thought . Maybe having something"
"[24:36] me013 | along the I mean , you can't really do vocal tract normalization . But something that had some of that effect"
[24:41] me018 | Yeah .
[24:42] me013 | being applied to the data in some way .
[24:45] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:45] me013 | Um .
"[24:54] mn007 | Do you have something simple in mind for I mean , vocal tract length normalization ?"
"[25:08] me018 | a similar idea to what they do in vocal tract length normalization . You know , you have some sort of a ,"
"[25:14] me018 | uh , general speech model , you know , maybe just a"
[25:18] me018 | mixture of Gaussians that you evaluate
"[25:21] me018 | every utterance against , and then you see"
"[25:36] me018 | uh , setting . Yeah ."
[25:41] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:42] me013 | latency that and where you 're not adjusting the statistical engine at all .
[25:47] me018 | Right .
[25:48] mn007 | Hmm .
[25:49] me018 | Could be expensive .
[25:49] me013 | I mean Yeah . No . Well not just expensive .
"[25:52] me013 | I I I don't see how you could possibly do it . You can't look at the whole utterance and do anything . You know , you can only Right ?"
"[25:56] me018 | Oh , right ."
"[25:59] me018 | Right . So whatever it was , it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis ."
[26:01] me013 | Yeah .
[26:07] me018 | Yeah .
[26:11] me018 | Yeah .
"[26:11] me013 | But as far as , I mean Like I thought BBN did a thing with , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization a ways back . Maybe other people did too . With with , uh , uh , l"
[26:25] me013 | So .
"[26:26] me013 | You know , third formant I if you imagine that to first order what happens with , uh , changing vocal tract is that ,"
[26:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:36] me013 | So , if you had a first formant that was one hundred hertz before , if the fifty if the vocal tract is fifty percent shorter ,"
"[26:42] me013 | then it would be out at seven fifty hertz , and so on ."
"[26:46] me013 | So , that 's a move of two hundred fifty hertz . Whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty - five hundred hertz ,"
"[26:55] me013 | So ,"
"[26:56] me013 | although , you frequently get less distinct"
[27:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:07] me018 | Hmm .
"[27:10] me013 | Um , that doesn't work for just"
[27:13] me018 | Yeah .
[27:18] me018 | Right .
"[27:19] me013 | Um . So . But on the other hand , male female is a is a is a much simpler categorization than figuring out a a factor to ,"
[27:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:29] me013 | the spectrum . So , um ."
"[27:36] me013 | uh , male female is good to know also . Um ."
[27:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:40] me013 | But ,"
"[27:41] me013 | you 'd have to figure out a way to to to , uh , incorporate it on the fly ."
"[27:46] me013 | Uh , I mean , I guess , as you say , one thing you could do is simply , uh ,"
[27:50] me013 | have the the male and female
[28:00] me013 | Um .
"[28:02] me013 | I don't know if that would really help , because you already have"
[28:05] me013 | males and females and it 's mm - hmm
"[28:07] me018 | Is it balanced , um , in terms of gender the data ?"
[28:11] me013 | Do you know ?
"[28:11] mn007 | Mmm . Almost , yeah ."
[28:13] me018 | Hmm .
[28:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[28:18] me013 | Hmm .
[28:33] mn007 | Um .
[28:35] mn007 | Mmm .
"[28:37] mn007 | There is something perhaps , I could spend some days to look at this thing ,"
[28:50] mn007 | they look as good as networks trained on PLP .
"[28:53] mn007 | But , um ,"
"[28:59] mn007 | on the SpeechDat - Car data , it 's not the case oh , well ."
[29:06] mn007 | and so
"[29:07] mn007 | maybe they 're , um , less more sensitive to"
"[29:10] mn007 | different recording conditions ,"
[29:15] mn007 | Mmm .
[29:22] me013 | were higher with MSG ?
[29:28] mn007 | the the error rate is higher .
"[29:30] mn007 | So , I don"
[29:31] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[29:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:36] me013 | MSG is very , very dif Eh , PLP is very much like mel cepstrum ."
[29:40] me013 | MSG is very different from both of them .
[29:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:43] me013 | So , if it 's very different , then this is the sort of thing I mean I 'm really glad Andreas brought this point up ."
[29:48] me013 | I sort of had forgotten to discuss it .
[29:51] me013 | Um .
[29:52] me013 | You always have to look at how
"[29:54] me013 | this uh , these"
"[29:56] me013 | adjustments , uh , affect things ."
"[29:59] me013 | And even though we 're not allowed to do that , again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features ."
"[30:05] me013 | So if it if in fact , uh The problem might be that the range of the MSG features is quite different than the range"
[30:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[30:11] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[30:12] me013 | of the PLP or mel cepstrum .
[30:14] me013 | And you might wanna change that .
[30:14] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[30:18] mn007 | Yeah .
"[30:18] mn007 | But , it 's d it 's after Well , it 's"
[30:24] mn007 | Mmm .
[30:25] me013 | Yeah .
[30:28] mn007 | Yeah . We we have estimation of post posteriors
[30:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:32] mn007 | with PLP and with MSG as input , so I don Well ."
[30:36] mn007 | I don't know .
[30:36] me013 | That means they 're between zero and one .
[30:39] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:39] me013 | But i it it it it doesn't necessarily You know , they could be ,"
[30:46] me013 | Do - doesn't tell you what the variance of the
[30:49] me013 | things is .
[30:50] mn007 | Mmm .
[30:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:57] me013 | Right ? Cuz if you 're taking the log of these things , it could be ,"
"[31:05] me013 | Knowing what the sum of the probabilities are , doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are ."
[31:09] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:13] me013 | So .
"[31:19] mn007 | Yeah . So we should look at the likelihood , or or what ? Or well ,"
[31:25] me013 | Yeah .
[31:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:27] me013 | Yeah .
"[31:29] me013 | Or what you know , what you 're uh the thing you 're actually looking at ."
[31:32] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[31:34] me013 | the values that are are actually being fed into HTK .
[31:37] me018 | No -
[31:37] me013 | What do they look like ?
"[31:39] me018 | And so th the , uh for the tandem system , the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid . Right ?"
[31:45] me018 | They 're sort of the pre - nonlinearity values ?
[31:48] me013 | Right .
[31:48] mn007 | Yes .
[31:49] me013 | So they 're kinda like log probabilities is what I was saying .
[31:51] me018 | OK . And tho that 's what goes into HTK ?
[31:58] me018 | OK .
[32:04] me013 | Um .
"[32:07] me013 | They aren't normalized after that , are they ?"
"[32:11] mn007 | Mmm . No , they are not no ."
[32:13] me013 | No .
[32:13] me013 | OK .
"[32:19] me013 | So , um ."
"[32:25] me013 | Yeah . Whatever they are at that point ,"
"[32:28] me013 | um , are they something for which taking"
[32:31] me013 | a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is gonna be a good or a bad thing ?
[32:39] me013 | So .
"[32:46] me013 | Uh , you know , subtract things from it , scale it from it , but nothing will have that same effect ."
[32:51] me013 | Um .
[32:55] me013 | So .
[32:56] me013 | Um .
[32:57] me018 | Yeah . Cuz if if the log probs that are coming out
"[33:00] me018 | of the MSG are really big ,"
[33:03] me018 | the standard insertion penalty is gonna have very little effect
[33:07] me013 | Right .
"[33:07] me018 | compared to ,"
"[33:09] me018 | you know ,"
[33:09] me013 | Yeah .
[33:10] me018 | a smaller set of log probs .
"[33:11] me013 | No . Again you don't really look at that . It 's something that , and then it 's going through this transformation that 's"
"[33:16] me013 | probably pretty close to It 's , eh , whatever the KLT is doing . But it 's probably pretty close to what a a a discrete cosine transformation is doing ."
[33:19] me018 | Yeah .
[33:31] me013 | Yeah . It may be entirely off and and it may be at the very least it may be quite different for MSG than it is for mel cepstrum or PLP .
[33:47] me013 | And if the if
"[33:51] me013 | i if there 's a fairly large effect of the difference , say , uh , uh , the r ratio between insertions and deletions"
[33:57] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:58] me013 | for the two cases then that would be , uh , an indicator that it might might be in that direction ."
[34:03] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:11] mn007 | Yeah . But ,"
[34:16] me013 | Yeah .
[34:16] mn007 | but sometimes it doesn't work . So .
[34:24] me013 | Yeah .
[34:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[34:25] mn007 | Yeah . Well .
[34:28] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:36] me013 | But it but , um , i it it could be that"
[34:40] me013 | when you say it works
"[34:42] me013 | maybe we could be doing much better , even in TI - digits . Right ?"
"[34:46] mn007 | Yeah . Yeah , sure ."
[34:46] me013 | So .
[34:50] me013 | Hmm ?
[34:51] me013 | Yeah .
"[35:00] mn007 | I think maybe we should ,"
"[35:03] mn007 | uh , try to integrate it in in our system ."
[35:08] me013 | Yeah .
[35:09] mn007 | Mmm .
[35:19] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[35:19] me013 | Right .
[35:28] mn007 | a al already a big bunch of the system of Ericsson .
[35:31] mn007 | Because
"[35:33] mn007 | he has spectral subtraction ,"
"[35:36] mn007 | then it 's followed by ,"
"[35:41] mn007 | other kind of processing that 's are dependent on the uh , if it 's speech or noi or silence ."
[35:47] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:53] mn007 | and s I I think it 's important ,"
[35:59] mn007 | to reduce this musical noise and this this increase of variance during silence portions .
[36:04] mn007 | So . Well .
[36:13] mn007 | and then just add
[36:19] mn007 | in the neural network .
[36:26] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[36:26] me013 | Yeah .
[36:29] me013 | OK .
[36:32] me013 | So .
[36:35] me013 | how are things going with what you 're doing ?
"[36:37] me026 | Oh . Well , um ,"
[36:39] me026 | I took a lot of time just getting my taxes out of the way multi - national taxes .
"[36:44] me026 | So , I 'm I 'm starting to write code now for my work but I don't have any results yet ."
"[36:48] me026 | Um , i it would be good for me to talk to Hynek , I think , when he 's here ."
[36:51] me013 | Yeah .
[36:52] me026 | Do you know what his schedule will be like ?
"[36:53] me013 | Uh , he 'll be around for three days ."
"[36:57] me026 | OK . So , y"
[36:58] me026 | OK .
[37:00] me013 | Um .
"[37:03] me013 | You know , he 's he 'll he 'll be"
[37:05] me013 | talking with everybody in this room So .
[37:07] me018 | But you said you won't you won't be here next Thursday ?
[37:09] me013 | Not Thursday and Friday . Yeah . Cuz I will be at faculty retreat .
[37:12] me018 | Hmm .
[37:13] me013 | So .
[37:15] me013 | connect with him and
"[37:25] me013 | Oh , how 'd taxes go ? Taxes go OK ?"
[37:40] me018 | Unless you 're getting money in two countries .
[37:43] me013 | I think you are . Aren't you ?
[37:43] me018 | They both want their cut .
[37:45] mn007 | Hmm .
[37:45] me018 | Right ?
[37:46] me013 | Yeah .
[37:47] me013 | Yeah .
[37:49] me013 | Huh .
[37:50] me013 | Canada w Canada wants a cut ?
[37:51] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[37:52] me013 | Have to do So you you have to do two returns ?
"[37:54] me026 | Mmm . W uh , for two thousand I did . Yeah ."
"[37:56] me013 | Oh , oh . Yeah . For tw That 's right , ju"
[37:59] me018 | But not for this next year ?
"[38:02] me013 | Yeah . Probably not this next year , I guess . Yeah ."
[38:05] me026 | Um .
[38:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[38:07] me026 | Uh , I 'll I 'll still have a bit of Canadian income but it 'll be less complicated because I will not be a considered a resident of Canada anymore , so I won't have to declare my American income on my Canadian return ."
[38:23] me013 | Uh .
"[38:24] me013 | Barry , do you wanna say something about your stuff here ?"
"[38:25] me006 | Oh , um ."
"[38:27] me006 | Right . I just , um ,"
"[38:30] me006 | continuing looking at , uh , ph uh , phonetic events ,"
"[38:34] me006 | and , uh , this Tuesday gonna be ,"
"[38:37] me006 | uh , meeting with John Ohala with Chuck to talk some more about these , uh , ph um , phonetic events ."
"[38:45] me006 | Um , came up with , uh ,"
"[38:47] me006 | a plan of attack ,"
"[38:49] me006 | uh , gonna execute , and"
[38:53] me006 | Yeah . It 's that 's pretty much it .
"[38:56] me013 | Oh , well . No - Um , why don't you say something about what it is ?"
[39:02] me006 | OK .
"[39:08] me006 | So , um ."
"[39:21] me006 | um , once we we would figure out a set of these events that can be , you know , um ,"
"[39:27] me006 | hand - labeled or or derived , uh , from h the hand - labeled phone targets ."
"[39:32] me006 | Um , we could take these events"
"[39:35] me006 | and , um ,"
"[39:37] me006 | do some cheating experiments ,"
"[39:39] me006 | um , where we feed , um , these events into an SRI system , um , eh , and evaluate its performance on a Switchboard task ."
"[39:51] me026 | Hey , Barry ?"
"[39:52] me006 | Uh , yeah ."
[39:52] me026 | Can you give an example of an event ?
"[39:54] me006 | Yeah . Sure . Um , I I can give you an example of twenty - odd events ."
"[40:01] me006 | So , he In this paper , um , it 's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events ."
"[40:07] me006 | So , things like frication"
"[40:10] me006 | or , uh , nasality ."
[40:12] me013 | Whose paper is it ?
"[40:13] me006 | Um , this is a"
[40:22] me013 | Yeah .
[40:26] me013 | Huh .
"[40:27] me013 | From , uh ,"
[40:28] me013 | University of Hamburg and
[40:31] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[40:33] me013 | OK .
[40:37] me018 | just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event .
[40:40] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:40] me018 | There 's , um in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between ,"
"[40:44] me018 | um , acoustic features and acoustic events ."
"[40:48] me018 | And I think of acoustic features as being , um ,"
"[40:55] me013 | So , stuff that 's not based on data ."
"[40:56] me018 | Stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily . Right . That 's not based on ,"
"[40:59] me018 | you know , acoustic data . So they talk about features for phones , like , uh ,"
"[41:03] me018 | its height , its tenseness , laxness , things like that , which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal ."
[41:04] me006 | Yeah .
[41:07] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:13] me018 | Versus an acoustic event , which is just some something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure ."
[41:32] me013 | @ @ auditory event .
"[41:35] me013 | And , uh , um ,"
[41:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:41] me013 | uh , uh , uh , with an A at the front . Uh ."
[41:44] me013 | And the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere .
[41:52] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[41:52] me013 | Um . A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic
"[41:57] me013 | will will do sort of this . I mean , there 's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gonna fire because something novel has happened ."
[42:09] me013 | beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of
[42:14] me018 | It 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up .
[42:15] me013 | Yeah .
"[42:19] me018 | you know , phonetic features as being top - down . You know , you look at the phone and you say this phone is supposed to be you know , have this feature , this feature , and this feature ."
"[42:28] me018 | Whether tha those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant . Whereas , an acoustic event goes the other way . Here 's the signal ."
[42:35] me018 | Here 's some event . What ?
[42:36] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:37] me018 | And then that you know , that may map to this phone"
[42:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:46] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[42:48] me006 | Yeah .
[42:49] me006 | So . Yeah .
[42:50] me026 | OK .
[42:51] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:53] me006 | Using these these events , um , you know , we can we can perform these these , uh , cheating experiments . See how how how good they are ,"
"[43:01] me006 | um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition ."
"[43:07] me006 | And ,"
"[43:09] me006 | and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar ,"
"[43:16] me006 | um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and"
[43:23] me006 | this this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses .
"[43:27] me006 | Um ,"
"[43:28] me006 | eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , CMR co - modulation release ."
"[43:39] me006 | and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way ,"
"[43:47] me006 | uh , similar to the way that , uh , Jeff Jeff , uh , Bilmes did his work ."
"[43:54] me006 | and while I 'm I 'm doing these , um , event detectors ,"
"[43:58] me006 | you know , I can ma mea measure my progress by comparing ,"
"[44:01] me006 | um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets ."
"[44:11] me006 | so , once we have these these , uh , event detectors ,"
"[44:14] me006 | um ,"
"[44:15] me006 | we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the SRI , um ,"
"[44:23] me006 | HMM HMM system ,"
"[44:25] me006 | and ,"
"[44:26] me006 | um and test it on on Switchboard or , um , maybe even Aurora stuff ."
"[44:34] me006 | And , that 's"
[44:36] me006 | pretty much the the big picture of of
"[44:40] me006 | um , the plan ."
"[44:44] me013 | By the way , um ,"
[44:50] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:52] me013 | uh , there 's a Professor Kollmeier , uh , from Germany who 's , uh ,"
"[44:57] me013 | uh ,"
[44:58] me013 | quite big in
"[45:00] me013 | the , uh , hearing - aid signal - processing"
"[45:08] me013 | auditory properties inspired by various , uh , brain function things ."
[45:13] me006 | Hmm .
"[45:13] me013 | So , um ,"
"[45:16] me013 | um , I think they 'll be interesting"
"[45:23] me013 | are , uh , developing ."
[45:23] me006 | Hmm .
[45:25] me006 | OK .
[45:30] me013 | different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out . So .
[45:36] me006 | OK .
"[45:39] me013 | OK . Well ,"
"[45:41] me013 | short meeting , but that 's OK ."
"[45:43] me013 | And , uh , we might as well do our"
"[45:46] me013 | digits . And like I say , I I encourage you to go ahead and meet , uh , next week"
"[45:51] me013 | with , uh ,"
"[45:53] me013 | uh , Hynek ."
"[45:56] me013 | Alright , I 'll I 'll start ."
[46:17] me013 | seventeen

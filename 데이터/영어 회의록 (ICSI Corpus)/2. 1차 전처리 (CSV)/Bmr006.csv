[00:01] fe016 | That 's looks strange .
"[00:01] me011 | OK , now we 're on and it seems to be working ."
[00:01] fe008 | Oh there we go .
[00:03] mn005 | One two three four five six
[00:05] fe008 | This looks good .
[00:05] me018 | That is weird .
[00:06] me018 | It 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something .
[00:09] me011 | I don't know what it is .
[00:10] me011 | But all all I know is that it seems like every time I
"[00:13] me011 | am up here after a meeting ,"
"[00:15] me011 | and I start it ,"
[00:16] me011 | it works fine .
"[00:18] me011 | And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it"
[00:25] me011 | been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .
[00:28] me018 | Next time you get it maybe we should write it down .
"[00:31] fe008 | Was it a pause , or ?"
[00:31] me011 | One of these days .
"[00:32] fe008 | OK . Was it on "" pause """
[00:33] fe008 | or something ?
[00:34] fe008 | OK .
[00:35] fe008 | Don't know .
"[00:36] me013 | So uh so the uh ,"
"[00:37] me013 | the new procedural change that just got suggested , which I think is a good idea is that um ,"
[00:42] me013 | we do the digit recordings at the end .
"[00:45] me013 | And that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting ,"
"[00:49] me013 | and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time ,"
"[00:53] me013 | uh , then they can run off ."
[00:55] me013 | It 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer
"[00:57] me013 | uh , sets of digits , but um , I think that way we 'll"
"[01:00] me013 | cut into people 's time , um ,"
[01:02] me013 | if someone 's on strict time
"[01:04] me013 | uh , less ."
"[01:06] me013 | So , I th I think I think we should start doing that ."
"[01:10] me013 | Um ,"
"[01:11] me013 | so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day ,"
"[01:14] me013 | maybe we should bring that up ,"
"[01:16] me013 | about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting ."
[01:19] me013 | uh
[01:20] me013 | @ @
"[01:21] me013 | that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is"
"[01:26] me013 | um , collected for the same meeting ,"
[01:30] me013 | I don't know . Wh - what what were some of the points again about that ?
"[01:35] fe016 | Uh , well , OK , I 'll back up . Um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting"
[01:37] me013 | Yeah .
[01:43] fe016 | about wanting to get more data and I I talked about this with Jane and
"[01:48] fe016 | Adam , um , and was thinking of"
[01:50] fe016 | this mostly just so that we could do research
[01:53] fe016 | on this data
"[01:55] fe016 | um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wanna work with us , th the guy that was at the last meeting ."
"[01:59] me018 | Well , great ."
[02:01] me018 | Great .
"[02:01] fe016 | And he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time ,"
[02:06] me018 | What a deal .
[02:07] fe016 | Yeah .
"[02:07] me011 | And what 's he interested in , specifically ?"
[02:08] fe016 | So
"[02:09] fe016 | he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but I liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in"
"[02:14] fe016 | higher level things , like language , and"
[02:17] fe016 | disfluencies and all kinds of eb
[02:18] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:19] fe016 | maybe prosody , so he 's just getting his feet wet in that ."
[02:20] me011 | Great .
[02:26] fe016 | he 'd be starting in
"[02:27] fe016 | January , next semester"
[02:30] me011 | Right .
"[02:31] fe016 | But , um , Jane and Adam brought up a lot of good points that"
[02:36] fe016 | just posting a note to Berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers
"[02:43] fe016 | are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth ."
"[02:47] fe016 | So , I thought about that and I think it 's still possible , um ,"
[02:51] fe016 | but I 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of
"[02:54] fe016 | types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a"
"[03:01] fe016 | Yeah , just because it would be very hard to"
"[03:03] fe016 | process the data in all senses , both"
"[03:06] fe016 | to get the ,"
"[03:09] fe016 | to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like"
"[03:13] fe016 | well , I was talking to Morgan about"
"[03:15] fe016 | things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about ."
[03:17] fe016 | I mean
[03:18] fe016 | it 's very different if you have a group that 's just
"[03:21] fe016 | giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . So ."
"[03:26] fe016 | Then I was um , talking to Morgan about some new proposed work in this area ,"
[03:33] fe016 | sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on
[03:36] fe016 | where
[03:37] fe016 | I was thinking of doing
[03:38] fe016 | some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues
[03:42] fe016 | in both the
[03:44] fe016 | utterances and in the
"[03:45] fe016 | utterance patterns , like in"
"[03:47] fe016 | numbers of overlaps and amount of speech ,"
[03:49] fe016 | sort of raw cues
[03:51] fe016 | from the interaction that can be measured from
[03:53] fe016 | the signals and from the diff
[03:55] fe016 | different microphones
[03:56] fe016 | that point to
"[03:58] fe016 | sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important"
[04:02] fe016 | for someone who didn't attend to listen to .
[04:05] fe016 | And in that
[04:11] fe016 | it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data
"[04:22] fe016 | You know , I would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization ."
[04:26] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[04:32] me011 | Right .
[04:34] me011 | Yep .
"[04:35] me011 | Yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . So ."
"[04:38] fe016 | So if that were the case then I think we 'd have enough . But basically , for anything where you 're trying to get"
[04:40] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:45] fe016 | a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting , um ,"
[04:50] fe016 | it would be too hard to have
[04:52] fe016 | fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really
[04:59] fe016 | rather we should have
"[05:04] fe016 | And then we need a couple that of We don't wanna just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but"
[05:11] fe016 | @ @
[05:12] fe016 | three or four different kinds .
"[05:12] me011 | Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the"
[05:17] me011 | morning meeting .
"[05:17] fe016 | See , I 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting ."
[05:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[05:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:20] me011 | Yeah , we we 've only had three . So ."
[05:22] fe016 | OK .
"[05:23] fe016 | But maybe that 's enough . So , in general , I was thinking more data but also"
[05:28] fe016 | data where we hold some parameters
"[05:31] fe016 | constant or fairly similar , like a meeting about"
[05:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[05:34] fe016 | of people doing a certain kind of
[05:36] fe016 | work where at least half the participants each time are the same .
"[05:40] me013 | Now , let l l let me just"
"[05:41] me013 | give you the other side to that cuz I ca because I I don't disagree with that ,"
[05:45] me013 | but I think there is a complimentary piece to it too .
"[05:48] me013 | Uh , for other kinds of research ,"
"[05:51] me013 | particularly the acoustic oriented research ,"
[05:53] me013 | I actually feel the opposite need .
[05:56] me013 | I 'd like to have lots of different people .
[05:56] fe016 | Right .
[05:58] fe016 | Right .
[05:58] me013 | As many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that
[06:02] me013 | you were just talking about
[06:03] me013 | it would have uh too few people from my point of view . I 'd like to have many different speakers .
"[06:08] me013 | So , um"
[06:15] mn005 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:17] me013 | and uh , I mean , sure , if we can"
[06:18] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[06:18] fe016 | Right .
"[06:19] me013 | get more from them , fine , but if we only get one or two from each group ,"
[06:22] me013 | that still could be useful acoustically just because we 'd have
"[06:24] fe016 | Yeah , I definitely agree with that . Definitely ."
[06:25] me013 | close and distant microphones with different people .
[06:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[06:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[06:28] mn005 | Yeah .
[06:28] fe008 | Can I can I say about that that the the issues that I think Adam and I raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .
"[06:36] fe008 | Because I think if you just say an And in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because"
[06:43] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:46] fe008 | that uh , it would be useful for for purposes You know ."
"[06:49] fe008 | But you know , I think"
[06:51] fe008 | I 've been I 've I I 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads I think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all .
"[07:00] me013 | Well , you want to i"
"[07:07] me013 | Well ,"
"[07:08] me013 | OK , uh , first place , I I I don't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , I think"
[07:12] fe008 | OK .
[07:13] me013 | there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz I I think that 's what we 're
"[07:17] me013 | investigating , so"
"[07:18] fe016 | a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . That 's I think what we and I agree with ."
"[07:20] me013 | Yeah ,"
[07:20] me011 | Right .
[07:20] fe008 | OK .
[07:21] me013 | yeah .
[07:22] me011 | Yep .
[07:23] me013 | I was thinking more in terms of talking to professors
"[07:26] me013 | uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and"
"[07:26] fe008 | Oh , interesting !"
"[07:30] me013 | uh , doctoral students who are leading projects"
[07:30] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:33] me013 | and offering to them
"[07:34] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[07:35] me013 | that they have their hold their meeting down here .
"[07:35] fe008 | Oh , interesting !"
"[07:37] me013 | Uh , that 's the first point . The second point is"
[07:40] me013 | um
"[07:41] me013 | I think that for some time now , going back through BeRP I think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents"
"[07:49] fe008 | Oh , oh . I 'm not saying accents ."
[07:51] fe008 | u The accent 's not the problem .
"[07:52] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[07:53] fe008 | No , it 's more a matter of uh , proficiency ,"
[07:55] fe008 | e e just simply fluency .
"[07:57] fe008 | I mean , I deal with people"
[07:57] me013 | Yeah .
"[07:59] fe008 | I think sometimes people ,"
[08:01] fe008 | undergraduates um in computer science
"[08:04] fe008 | uh , have language skills that make , you know that their their fluency and writing skills"
[08:08] fe008 | are not so strong .
"[08:10] me011 | Yeah . Yeah , just talking about ."
"[08:12] fe008 | Well , e I just think , but you know , it 's like when you get into the graduate level ,"
[08:13] me011 | We all had the same thought .
"[08:17] fe008 | uh , no problem ."
"[08:18] fe008 | I mean , I 'm not saying accents . I 'm say I 'm saying fluency . Well , yeah ."
[08:18] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[08:20] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[08:22] fe008 | I 'm just saying fluency .
[08:27] me011 | I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .
[08:32] me013 | Yeah .
[08:32] me011 | And and I think
[08:37] me011 | I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have
"[08:41] me011 | uh , g particularly good English skills ."
"[08:43] fe008 | OK , now can I can I say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that"
"[08:48] fe008 | um , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together ."
[08:54] me011 | Right .
[08:54] me013 | Right .
"[08:59] fe008 | You know this The idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group ,"
[09:06] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[09:06] fe008 | but the idea of language models , which are fund you know"
"[09:10] fe008 | generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent"
[09:15] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:15] fe008 | or an hour invested in preparing the data ,"
[09:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:18] fe008 | if you have a choice between people who are
"[09:24] fe008 | um ,"
"[09:25] fe008 | i more fluent , more more"
"[09:27] fe008 | close to being academic English , then it would seem to me to be a good thing ."
[09:31] me013 | I guess I maybe Hmm .
[09:33] me013 | I
[09:47] fe008 | but their interlanguage isn't
[09:47] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[09:49] fe008 | really a match to any existing ,"
"[09:51] fe008 | uh , language model ,"
"[09:54] me013 | Well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group ."
[09:58] me011 | Right .
[09:58] me013 | because because they most the network group is almost entirely Germans and Spaniards .
[09:59] fe008 | Well I
[10:01] fe008 | Oh .
[10:07] me013 | I see .
[10:10] me013 | OK .
"[10:15] fe008 | a grammar , basically ,"
[10:17] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[10:17] fe008 | that um , wo would be"
"[10:19] fe008 | a a possibility . So y so if you wanted to bring in a model like Dan Jurafsky 's model , an"
"[10:23] fe008 | and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever ,"
[10:27] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:29] fe008 | uh , it seems like"
"[10:33] fe008 | I 'm I what I think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest"
[10:34] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[10:41] fe008 | of central corp
"[10:42] fe008 | things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics ."
[10:48] fe008 | That 's that 's my point .
[10:49] fe008 | Which which includes both top - down and bottom - up .
[10:49] me013 | OK .
[10:49] mn005 | It 's difficult .
[10:52] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:52] me013 | OK , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get ."
"[10:54] me013 | I mean , it it I think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together ,"
"[11:00] fe008 | Yes , that 's fine ."
[11:02] fe008 | That 's fine .
"[11:02] me013 | and it 's from the Berkeley campus , probably most of it"
[11:06] fe008 | Exactly . And my point in m in my note to Liz was
[11:07] me013 | OK .
[11:08] fe008 | I think that undergrads are an iff iffy population .
"[11:10] fe016 | I definitely agree with that , I mean , for this purpose ."
[11:11] me013 | OK .
[11:12] me013 | OK .
"[11:13] fe008 | Grads and professors , fine ."
[11:13] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:13] me011 | Well , not to mention the fact that I would be"
[11:15] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:16] me011 | hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one ."
[11:22] me011 | So .
"[11:22] me013 | Oh , you age - ist !"
[11:23] me011 | What 's that ?
"[11:24] me011 | Well , age - ist . The "" eighteen "" is because of the consent form ."
"[11:26] fe016 | Right ,"
[11:27] fe016 | Yeah .
[11:29] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:30] me013 | Yes .
"[11:30] fe008 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[11:30] mn005 | Yeah .
[11:30] me011 | So .
"[11:31] fe016 | I have a uh , um , question . Well , Morgan , you were mentioning that Mari may not"
[11:36] fe016 | use the k equipment from IBM
"[11:39] fe016 | if they found something else , cuz"
"[11:44] me013 | assessing whether they should do that or y do something else ,"
[11:47] me013 | hopefully over the next few weeks .
"[11:48] fe016 | Cuz I mean , one remote possibility is that"
"[11:51] fe016 | if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she weren't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ?"
[11:57] fe016 | And and
"[11:59] fe016 | I mean , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building"
[12:05] fe016 | where we could
[12:09] me011 | I think we 'd need a real motivated
[12:12] me011 | partner to do that . We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .
[12:15] fe016 | Right .
"[12:16] fe016 | But if there were such a I mean it 's a remote possibility , then"
[12:16] me011 | So .
"[12:20] fe016 | um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . So it 's just a"
[12:23] me011 | Yep .
[12:26] fe016 | just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware .
"[12:29] me013 | Yeah , I mean the other thing that I was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . Uh ."
[12:33] me011 | Right .
[12:36] me013 | But .
"[12:37] me013 | Um ,"
"[12:38] me011 | Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS ."
"[12:42] me011 | You know , to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult ."
[12:45] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:45] fe016 | But you may not need a separate room , you know , the idea is , if they have a meeting room"
[12:47] me011 | That 's true . True .
[12:47] me013 | Yeah .
[12:49] fe016 | and
[12:52] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[12:55] me011 | Yep .
"[12:56] me013 | Well , maybe John would let us put it into the phonology lab or something . You know ."
[12:57] fe016 | Huh .
[12:59] me011 | Yep .
[13:00] fe016 | I I think it 's not out of the question . Um .
[13:01] me013 | Yeah .
"[13:02] me011 | Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting ."
[13:02] fe016 | So .
[13:06] mn005 | Yeah .
[13:06] me011 | another
[13:07] me011 | type of meeting .
[13:07] fe016 | Right .
[13:08] fe016 | Right .
"[13:08] mn005 | But I I I think you need , uh , another portable thing"
"[13:12] mn005 | a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from ICSI ."
[13:14] me011 | Hmm .
[13:19] me013 | Yeah .
[13:21] me013 | Yeah .
[13:21] me011 | Right .
[13:29] me013 | Yeah .
"[13:37] mn005 | eh , a lot of , eh , head phones eh in different people when"
"[13:41] mn005 | you have to to record only with , eh , this kind of , eh , d device ."
[13:44] me011 | I think if we if we wanna just record with
"[13:47] me011 | the tabletop microphones , that 's easy ."
[13:48] mn005 | Oh - yeah .
"[13:50] mn005 | Ye - Yeah , yeah ."
"[13:50] me011 | Right ? That 's very easy , but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting ."
[13:53] mn005 | Yeah .
"[13:53] me013 | Actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating ."
"[13:58] me013 | We realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , OK , there 's these different things that we want to do with it ."
"[14:02] me013 | So , um , it 's true that we wanna be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues ."
"[14:13] me013 | But on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it ."
"[14:27] me013 | But we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's OK too ."
"[14:33] me013 | Uh ,"
[14:34] me013 | i
"[14:34] me013 | We realized in discussion that the other thing is ,"
[14:37] me013 | what about this business of distant and close microphones ?
"[14:41] me013 | I mean , we really wanna have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it ."
"[14:46] me013 | For th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone ."
[14:54] me013 | You actually don't .
"[14:54] me011 | And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean ."
[14:55] mn005 | Yeah .
"[14:56] fe016 | Yea - yeah yeah , you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone . You can use found data ."
[14:57] fe008 | Which one did you mean ?
[14:57] me013 | You d
"[14:58] me013 | You don't ne it doesn't you just need some microphone , somewhere ."
[14:59] me011 | Ye - Yeah . Yep .
[15:01] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:01] me011 | Tape recorder .
[15:01] fe008 | Oh .
[15:02] mn005 | Yeah .
[15:04] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:04] fe016 | Um ,"
"[15:05] fe016 | but I think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect ,"
[15:06] me013 | Yeah .
"[15:09] fe016 | you know , each person who 's interested in I mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for ,"
"[15:17] fe016 | um , they need to be"
[15:19] fe016 | taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .
[15:22] me013 | Right .
"[15:24] fe016 | So in my case , um ,"
[15:25] fe016 | I think there w
"[15:30] fe016 | And so I 'm looking and thinking , "" Well I 'd be glad to"
"[15:35] fe016 | to help th in my interest . """
[15:36] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:36] fe016 | And other people need to do that for themselves , uh , h"
[15:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[15:42] me013 | But I think that I 'm raising that cuz I think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , "" Well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , "" well maybe you don't ."
[15:50] me011 | Yeah . For some of it .
[15:51] fe016 | Right .
"[15:55] me013 | uh , a transcription from later ,"
[15:57] me013 | you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording .
[16:01] me011 | Yep .
[16:04] mn005 | Yeah .
"[16:06] fe016 | So that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that"
"[16:11] fe016 | sounds very language oriented . You may say well ,"
"[16:14] fe016 | "" Oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . "" I mean , you don't even need the speech signal . But"
[16:17] me013 | Right .
[16:19] fe016 | what you what I was thinking is long term what would be neat is
[16:22] fe016 | to be able to pick up on
[16:25] fe016 | Suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to
[16:29] fe016 | be able to determine this . There 's lots of cues you 're not gonna have .
[16:31] fe016 | So
[16:31] me011 | Right .
[16:32] me013 | Yeah .
[16:32] fe016 | I do think that long term you should always try to
[16:33] mn005 | Yeah .
"[16:37] fe016 | of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this"
[16:41] fe016 | corpus powerful .
[16:42] me011 | Yep .
[16:44] me013 | I I I agree . Uh
[16:46] me013 | but I I think that
[16:48] me013 | the uh i
[16:53] me013 | shouldn't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .
[16:56] me011 | Yep .
[16:58] fe016 | OK .
"[17:01] me013 | If you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away ."
"[17:06] me013 | Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here ,"
"[17:10] me013 | it won't happen quickly , it won't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know"
"[17:14] me013 | keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o"
[17:16] fe016 | So
[17:18] me013 | I think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here .
"[17:20] fe016 | OK , so that 's"
[17:21] fe016 | OK .
[17:22] me013 | We 're set up for it .
[17:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:24] me013 | The room is is really , uh , underused ."
[17:28] fe016 | Right .
[17:28] fe008 | I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .
"[17:30] me011 | Yeah , I thought so too ."
[17:30] me013 | Free lunch is good .
[17:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[17:34] fe016 | But the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of
[17:39] fe016 | your time and the overhead in bringing people down .
[17:41] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[17:42] me018 | No crunchy food .
[17:42] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:43] fe016 | Well , it would be lunch afterwards . Right ."
"[17:44] me011 | Well , I was thinking , lunch after ."
[17:46] fe016 | And they 'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert .
"[17:47] me013 | Yeah , they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food ."
[17:47] me011 | Yep .
[17:50] fe016 | Yeah .
"[17:51] me011 | Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered ."
[17:55] me011 | Should I pursue that ?
"[17:57] fe016 | Oh , definitely , yeah ."
[17:57] me011 | Yeah .
[17:58] me013 | Yeah .
[17:59] me011 | They 've decided not to do go into speech .
[18:05] me013 | Tell them about the free lunch .
[18:06] fe016 | Yeah .
[18:07] fe016 | Yeah .
"[18:09] fe016 | I 'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers ,"
[18:12] me011 | Right .
[18:12] me013 | Yeah .
[18:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[18:15] me011 | That 's alright . No , the they they 're very weird ."
"[18:29] me013 | The other thing is ,"
"[18:31] me013 | uh , that we we talked about is give to them uh , burn an extra CD - ROM ."
[18:35] me011 | Yep .
[18:35] me011 | Let them have their meeting .
"[18:39] fe016 | I thought he meant , "" Give them a music CD , "" like they g"
"[18:47] fe016 | You know , I personally would not want a CD of my meeting , but"
[18:49] me011 | Mmm .
[18:50] me011 | Of the meeting ?
"[18:54] me018 | Oh , that 's a good idea ."
[18:54] fe016 | Right .
[18:55] fe016 | Right .
[18:55] me011 | It 'd be fun .
[18:56] me013 | Yeah .
"[18:56] me011 | I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know ."
[18:56] fe016 | Right .
[18:56] mn005 | Yeah .
[18:58] me013 | But it als
[18:58] me011 | It 's a novelty item .
[18:58] fe016 | Right .
"[18:59] me013 | It it it also I think builds up towards the goal . We 're saying , "" Look , you know , you 're gonna get this . Is - is isn't that neat . Then you 're gonna go home with it . It 's actually p"
[19:07] me011 | Yep .
"[19:08] me013 | but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless ,"
[19:09] fe016 | Right .
"[19:11] me013 | and then , we 're gonna move this technology , so it 'll become useful . """
"[19:14] fe016 | No , I think that 's a great idea , actually . But we might need a little more to incentivize them , that 's all ."
[19:14] me013 | So .
[19:14] mn005 | Yeah .
[19:16] me018 | What if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ?
"[19:20] me011 | Oh , yeah ."
"[19:21] me011 | I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So ."
[19:21] me013 | Oh yeah .
"[19:23] fe016 | Well , that 's interesting ."
"[19:24] fe008 | I hav I have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the CD immediately ,"
[19:24] me011 | I thought we could point that out .
[19:33] fe008 | You know ?
[19:34] me013 | Good point .
[19:35] fe008 | So .
[19:35] fe008 | We could burn it after it 's been cleared with the transcript stage .
[19:38] me013 | r Right .
"[19:38] fe008 | And then they they get a CD , but just not the same day ."
"[19:39] fe016 | Oh , right ."
"[19:41] fe016 | If It should be the same CD - ROM that we distribute publically , right ?"
"[19:41] me011 | Yeah , that 's right ."
[19:42] me011 | That 's a good point .
"[19:44] me011 | Right , it can't be the internal one ."
[19:45] fe016 | Otherwise they 're not allowed to
"[19:46] fe008 | There we go . Oh , I like that ."
[19:47] me011 | That 's right .
[19:47] fe016 | play it for anyone .
[19:47] fe008 | Well put . Well put .
"[19:48] fe008 | So , after the transcript screening phase ."
"[19:50] me011 | Yeah , that 's true ."
[19:51] fe008 | Things have been weeded out .
[19:51] fe016 | Otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages .
[19:53] me011 | Yeah .
"[19:54] fe008 | "" Yeah , well , I got this CD , and , Your Honor , I """
[19:59] fe016 | That 's a good point .
"[20:02] me013 | Yeah so that 's so let 's start with Haas , and"
[20:04] fe016 | Sorry I have to leave .
[20:04] me013 | Yeah .
[20:05] fe016 | I will be here full - time next week .
"[20:05] me013 | Oh , that 's fine ."
"[20:07] me011 | OK , see you ."
[20:10] me013 | OK .
[20:11] me011 | No .
[20:13] me013 | That 's alright .
[20:14] me018 | See you .
[20:14] me013 | OK .
[20:15] mn005 | See you .
"[20:19] me013 | Let 's see . So that was that topic ,"
[20:21] me013 | and
"[20:22] me013 | then um , I guess another topic would be"
[20:29] me011 | We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings .
"[20:36] me011 | So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and"
"[20:38] me011 | still doing a bunch of archiving , I I 'm in the midst of doing"
"[20:42] me011 | the P - files from uh ,"
[20:47] mn005 | Eleven ?
[20:49] me011 | And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone .
[20:50] me018 | Where did you copy it to ?
"[20:52] me011 | Well , it 's Abbott ."
[20:55] me013 | Sk -
[20:56] me013 | It 's copying from one place on Abbott to another place on Abbott ?
[20:58] me011 | Tape .
[20:59] mn005 | Tape ?
[20:59] me011 | I did an archive .
[20:59] me013 | Oh ! I 'm sorry .
"[20:59] me018 | Oh , on the tape . Ah !"
[21:00] mn005 | Oh .
"[21:00] me011 | So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files ."
[21:03] me011 | So that will give us
[21:03] mn005 | Eleven hours ?
[21:04] me018 | Wow !
[21:05] mn005 | Oh .
"[21:06] fe008 | Yeah , the archiving m program does take a long time ."
[21:07] mn005 | Yeah .
[21:09] me011 | Yep .
[21:09] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[21:09] me011 | And so one
"[21:10] me011 | That that will be done , like ,"
"[21:12] me011 | in about two hours . And so uh ,"
[21:17] mn005 | Yeah .
"[21:17] fe008 | One thing The good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . I mean , it it it The other direction is fast ,"
[21:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[21:22] me013 | Is it ?
[21:23] me011 | Right .
[21:24] fe008 | but this direction is really slow .
[21:25] me013 | Hmm .
[21:25] mn005 | Yeah .
"[21:25] me011 | Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also ."
"[21:28] fe008 | Yeah , OK ."
[21:28] me011 | So .
[21:28] mn005 | Yeah .
[21:28] me011 | And that takes a while .
[21:29] me018 | Generating a clone ?
"[21:29] fe008 | Yeah , that 's a good point ."
[21:30] me011 | Two copies .
[21:31] fe008 | Yeah .
"[21:31] me011 | One offsite , one onsite ."
[21:32] me018 | Oh !
[21:33] me018 | Oh !
[21:34] me018 | Hunh !
"[21:38] fe008 | stuff will be saved , it 's just that you 're relocating it ?"
"[21:40] fe008 | I mean , so we 're gonna get more disk space ? Or did I ?"
"[21:43] me011 | No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable"
[21:46] fe008 | OK .
"[21:47] fe008 | Oh , good ."
[21:49] fe008 | I see .
"[21:49] me011 | um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them ."
"[21:52] me011 | And for the full , uh , hundred forty hour"
[21:52] fe008 | OK .
[21:55] me011 | sets .
[21:56] me011 | And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had
[21:59] fe008 | Wow .
[21:59] mn005 | Yeah .
[22:00] fe008 | Wow .
"[22:01] me013 | W w we are getting more space . We are getting , uh , another disk rack and and four thirty - six gigabyte disks ."
[22:07] me013 | Uh so uh but
[22:11] me013 | that 's not gonna happen instantaneously .
[22:12] me011 | Or maybe six .
[22:14] me013 | Or maybe six ?
"[22:15] me011 | The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did ."
[22:22] me011 | Th -
"[22:23] me011 | One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , you know , fifty percent more ."
[22:29] me018 | Is there a difference in price or something ?
"[22:30] me011 | Well , what happened is that"
"[22:31] me011 | we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave , and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices ."
[22:38] mn005 | Oh .
"[22:39] me011 | And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors ."
[22:41] fe008 | Wow .
[22:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:47] me018 | Hmm . I 've been looking at the , uh ,"
[22:49] me018 | Aurora data
"[22:50] me018 | and , um ,"
"[22:52] me018 | first first look at it ,"
[22:54] me018 | there were basically three
"[22:58] me018 | One was called Aurora , one was Spanish , which was Carmen 's Spanish stuff , and the other one was , um ,"
[23:04] me018 | SPINE .
"[23:06] me018 | And so , um ,"
[23:08] me018 | I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that
[23:11] me018 | the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk .
"[23:15] me018 | So , um ,"
[23:17] me018 | I realized that
[23:22] me018 | the static data .
"[23:23] me018 | So I moved that ,"
"[23:25] me018 | and then um ,"
"[23:28] me018 | before I actually deleted the old stuff ,"
"[23:30] me018 | um , but I haven't heard back yet ."
[23:34] me018 | today to see if he 's deleted it or not .
"[23:36] me018 | And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA ,"
[23:40] me018 | I had copied stuff there that was
[23:42] me018 | dynamic data .
"[23:44] me018 | And so ,"
[23:44] me018 | I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .
[23:48] me018 | And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .
"[23:51] me018 | And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff . I have to meet with , uh , Stephane"
[23:55] me018 | to do that . So .
"[23:56] me013 | So , but , uh y"
"[23:58] me013 | you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the Broadcast News ,"
"[24:04] me013 | but , we have some"
"[24:06] me013 | other disks , some of which you 're using for Aurora , but"
[24:10] me011 | Yep .
[24:11] me013 | other space now ?
"[24:11] me011 | So , so ,"
"[24:13] me011 | uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is ,"
[24:17] me013 | Yeah .
[24:17] me011 | and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .
[24:19] me013 | Yeah .
[24:19] me018 | Is that the one that has is that DC ?
[24:19] me011 | So .
[24:21] me011 | Yep .
"[24:22] me011 | No , no , well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is . I think it 's DI ."
[24:27] me011 | I don't remember .
[24:30] me011 | Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .
"[24:32] me018 | OK , DC . Yeah ."
"[24:32] me011 | I just don't remember , it might be DC ."
[24:34] me011 | And
[24:35] me011 | that has enough for about four more meetings right now .
[24:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:37] me011 | Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand ."
"[24:42] me011 | Um , someone deleted something somewhere ."
[24:44] me011 | And so we have some room again .
[24:46] me011 | And then
"[24:47] me011 | with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings , so , you know , we have a couple weeks ."
"[24:51] me011 | Uh , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk ."
"[24:58] me018 | One question I had for you was ,"
"[25:00] me018 | um ,"
[25:01] me018 | we sh probably should move the Aurora an
[25:04] me018 | and all that other stuff off of
[25:07] me018 | the Meeting Recorder disk .
[25:08] me018 | Is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ?
[25:11] me011 | We should put it onto the Broadcast News one .
[25:13] me011 | That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out .
[25:14] me018 | OK .
[25:17] me018 | Right .
[25:18] me018 | Right . Do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? OK .
[25:20] me011 | No .
"[25:21] me011 | I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head ."
[25:22] me018 | Yeah . OK .
"[25:23] me018 | Alright , I 'll find out from you ."
"[25:24] me011 | But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it ."
[25:29] me018 | OK .
[25:30] me011 | Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk .
"[25:33] me013 | Uh , OK ,"
"[25:35] me013 | @ @ So , uh ,"
[25:39] me013 | my agenda was just to hear hear an update on
[25:42] mn005 | Uh - huh .
[25:43] me013 | OK .
[25:43] mn005 | OK .
[25:46] mn005 | The result of my work during the last days .
[25:51] mn005 | I read .
"[25:52] mn005 | Eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , I work , eh , in my house ,"
"[25:56] mn005 | eh , in a lot of ways and"
"[25:58] mn005 | thinking , reading eh , different things about the the Meeting Recording project ."
[26:00] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[26:03] mn005 | And I have , eh , some ideas ."
[26:07] fe008 | I 'm glad to hear it . Glad to hear it .
"[26:07] mn005 | Because you have the the the distribution , now . But"
"[26:10] mn005 | for me , eh is interesting because , eh , eh ,"
[26:17] me011 | I 've seen it already .
[26:20] fe008 | Yeah .
[26:21] fe008 | Yeah .
[26:27] me011 | Yep .
[26:28] mn005 | Yeah .
[26:29] me011 | Throughout the meeting .
"[26:29] mn005 | Eh , by a moment I have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n I I did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording ,"
"[26:37] mn005 | with eh , a exact mark ."
[26:40] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:40] me011 | Oh , you did that by hand ?"
[26:41] mn005 | Heh ?
"[26:41] mn005 | That 's eh ,"
[26:42] mn005 | yet
"[26:43] mn005 | b b Yeah , by b b by hand by hand because ,"
[26:43] me011 | Can I see that ?
[26:46] me013 | Oh .
"[26:53] mn005 | I don't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because I I I haven't a lot eh , enough time to to to work ."
"[26:59] mn005 | uh , only just eh , six months , as you know ,"
"[27:02] mn005 | but , eh , my idea is , eh ,"
"[27:04] mn005 | is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter ."
[27:09] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:09] mn005 | Eh but eh , eh ,"
"[27:10] mn005 | in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session"
"[27:16] me011 | Yes , absolutely ."
[27:17] mn005 | to t to to evaluate
[27:19] me011 | And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ?
[27:19] mn005 | the the the tool .
[27:23] me011 | Have you done that or are you planning to do that ?
"[27:25] mn005 | No , I I plan to do that ."
"[27:30] mn005 | eh , the idea is the is the following ."
"[27:33] mn005 | Now , eh ,"
"[27:34] mn005 | I need ehm ,"
[27:36] mn005 | to detect eh all the overlapping zones exactly .
"[27:39] mn005 | I I will I will eh , talk about eh , in the in the blackboard"
[27:40] fe008 | Yeah .
[27:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[27:43] mn005 | about the my ideas .
"[27:45] mn005 | Eh , um ,"
[27:47] mn005 | This information
"[27:48] mn005 | eh , with eh , exactly time marks"
"[27:51] mn005 | eh , for the overlapping zones"
"[27:57] mn005 | a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone ."
"[28:00] mn005 | I mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker"
"[28:04] mn005 | without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech ."
"[28:15] mn005 | And , I need t true eh , silence"
"[28:23] mn005 | eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant"
[28:29] me011 | Right .
"[28:29] mn005 | to eh , classify ."
[28:31] mn005 | the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones .
[28:35] mn005 | The idea is
"[28:38] mn005 | eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet ,"
[28:40] mn005 | but eh my idea is
"[28:41] mn005 | to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn ,"
[28:46] mn005 | a person strong in neural net algorithm
[28:49] mn005 | to eh study
"[28:50] mn005 | what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify"
[28:56] mn005 | eh speech and overlapping eh speech .
[28:58] me018 | Mmm .
"[28:59] mn005 | And my idea is eh ,"
[29:00] mn005 | it would be interesting to to have
"[29:03] mn005 | eh , a control set ."
"[29:04] mn005 | And my control set eh , will be the eh , silence ,"
"[29:08] mn005 | silence without eh , any any noise ."
[29:08] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:11] fe008 | Which means that we 'd still You 'd hear the Yeah . That 's interesting . This is like a ground level , with It 's not it 's not total silence ."
"[29:12] me011 | Yeah , fans ."
"[29:14] mn005 | With with , yeah , the background . Eh ,"
"[29:16] mn005 | I I mean eh , noise eh ,"
"[29:18] mn005 | eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh ,"
[29:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:23] mn005 | eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech ."
[29:32] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[29:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[29:32] me011 | So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ?
"[29:36] mn005 | Yeah , I have mark"
[29:37] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:37] mn005 | in in in in that Not in all in all the the file ,"
"[29:41] mn005 | only eh , eh , nnn , mmm ,"
"[29:44] mn005 | I have eh ,"
"[29:46] mn005 | I don't remind what is the the the the quantity , but eh ,"
[29:50] mn005 | I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones .
"[29:55] mn005 | I have , eh , two hundred and thirty ,"
"[29:58] mn005 | more or less , overlapping zones , and"
[30:02] fe008 | Great .
[30:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[30:03] fe008 | Great .
"[30:08] mn005 | with eh , my my segmentation by hand ."

[31:59] mn005 | Yeah .
"[32:00] fe008 | I 've gotta ask you . So ,"
[32:00] mn005 | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
"[32:01] fe008 | uh , the difference between the top two ,"
"[32:02] fe008 | i So so I start at the bottom , so "" silence "" is clear ."
"[32:06] fe008 | By "" speech "" do you mean speech by one sp by one person only ?"
"[32:10] fe008 | OK , and then and then the top includes"
"[32:12] fe008 | people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech So ,"
[32:12] me011 | One or two or more .
[32:16] mn005 | but
"[32:18] mn005 | No , by th by the moment n"
[32:20] mn005 | Yeah .
[32:20] mn005 | Yeah .
[32:21] mn005 | Yeah .
[32:21] fe008 | that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . OK .
[32:22] mn005 | Yeah .
[32:23] mn005 | Yeah .
"[32:24] mn005 | Eh , in the first moment , because , eh , eh , I I have information , eh , of the overlapping zones ,"
"[32:30] mn005 | eh , information about if the , eh , overlapping zone is , eh , from a speech , clear speech , from a one to a two eh speaker ,"
"[32:46] fe008 | So it 's basi it 's basically speech wi som with with something overlapping , which could be speech but doesn't need to be ."
[32:47] mn005 | especially speech .
"[32:51] mn005 | No , no , es especially eh , overlapping speech"
"[32:57] me013 | No , but there 's but , I think she 's saying "" Where do you In these three categories , where do you put the instances"

"[33:06] me013 | and other sounds which are not speech ? """
[33:10] mn005 | Ah !
[33:11] me013 | Which category do you put that in ?
"[33:12] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right . That 's my question ."
[33:13] mn005 | Yeah .
"[33:14] mn005 | Yeah , he here I I put eh speech from eh ,"
"[33:18] mn005 | from , eh , one speaker"
[33:18] fe008 | Oh !
"[33:21] mn005 | eh , any any any events more ."
"[33:23] me013 | Right ,"
[33:24] me013 | so where do you put speech from one speaker
[33:26] me013 | that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ?
[33:30] me013 | Which catege which category ?
[33:30] fe008 | Like a c
[33:30] mn005 | Where ? Where What is the class ?
"[33:32] mn005 | No . By the moment , no ."
[33:33] fe008 | Oh .
"[33:34] me011 | Yeah , yeah , that 's what he was saying before ."
[33:34] mn005 | For for the by the @ @
[33:35] me013 | not not marked .
"[33:35] mn005 | no , @ @ because I I I I want to limit"
[33:36] me013 | OK .
[33:39] me013 | Got it .
"[33:39] mn005 | the the nnn , the the study ."
"[33:41] me011 | Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those ."
[33:41] me018 | So you 're not using all of the data .
[33:44] me011 | Yeah .
[33:44] mn005 | Exactly .
[33:45] me013 | Yeah .
[33:45] fe008 | So you 're ignoring overlapping events unless they 're speech with speech .
"[33:47] mn005 | Yeah , be"
"[33:49] me013 | Yeah , that 's fine ."
[33:49] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:49] fe008 | OK .
"[33:50] mn005 | "" Why ? Why ? What 's the reason ? "" because"
[33:50] me013 | @ @
[33:54] mn005 | the first
[33:55] fe008 | We 're just
[33:56] me013 | trying to understand what what you were doing . OK .
[33:57] mn005 | Yeah .
[33:57] fe008 | Yeah .
"[33:58] fe008 | Yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . So ,"
[34:00] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:01] fe008 | this is this is a subset .
[34:01] mn005 | Yeah .
"[34:01] mn005 | In the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class ,"
"[34:05] mn005 | to consider all the all the information , you you mentioned before"
[34:07] me013 | Yeah .
[34:08] fe008 | OK .
[34:10] fe008 | Yeah .
"[34:10] mn005 | but eh , the the first idea Because eh , I don't know"
[34:15] me013 | Yeah .
[34:15] me011 | Right .
[34:16] me013 | Sure .
"[34:16] me018 | Is your silence category pure silence , or ? What if there was a door - slam or something ?"
"[34:21] mn005 | No , no , it 's pure silence ."
[34:22] me018 | Pure silence .
[34:23] mn005 | It 's the control set .
[34:24] me018 | OK .
[34:24] mn005 | OK ?
[34:24] mn005 | It 's the control set .
[34:25] me013 | What you Well w
[34:28] me011 | With the fan .
[34:28] me013 | I I think what you m
[34:30] me013 | I think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that don't have impulsive noises .
[34:36] mn005 | Yeah .
"[34:36] me013 | Right ? Cuz you 're calling what you 're calling "" event "" is somebody coughing"
[34:45] mn005 | Yeah .
[34:45] me013 | But steady - state noises are part of the background .
[34:48] mn005 | Yeah .
"[34:48] me013 | Which , are being , included in that . Right ?"
"[34:49] mn005 | @ @ h here yet ,"
[34:51] me013 | Yeah .
[34:52] fe008 | So it 's like a signal - noise situation .
[34:52] mn005 | yet
"[34:53] mn005 | I I I I I think I I think , eh ,"
[34:54] fe008 | Yeah .
"[34:55] mn005 | there are that some kind of noises that , eh ,"
"[34:58] mn005 | don't don't wanted to to be in that , eh ,"
[35:01] mn005 | in that control set .
"[35:02] mn005 | But I prefer , I prefer at at the first , eh ,"
"[35:05] mn005 | the the silence with eh , this eh this kind"
"[35:07] fe008 | Well , steady state ."
[35:08] mn005 | of the of eh of noise .
[35:12] mn005 | Yeah .
[35:13] mn005 | Yeah .
[35:15] me013 | Yeah .
[35:15] mn005 | Yeah .
[35:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[35:18] mn005 | And , um , with this information"
"[35:22] mn005 | The idea is eh , eh , nnn ,"
[35:25] mn005 | I have

[36:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:06] mn005 | I have to to test , but eh"
[36:08] me018 | You have your own ?
"[36:08] mn005 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[36:09] me018 | Oh !
[36:09] mn005 | I ha I have prepare .

[36:20] me018 | Oh !
[36:21] me018 | What 's it written in ?
"[36:22] mn005 | Eh , em , I I I don't remember what is the the name of the of the author ,"

[36:31] me018 | Ah .
[36:31] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[36:33] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[36:33] mn005 | and of from Edinburgh
"[36:35] mn005 | eh , from Cambridge , eh , and from our department . And And"

[37:10] mn005 | And
"[37:11] mn005 | in a first eh , nnn , step"
[37:14] mn005 | in the investi in the research in

"[37:19] mn005 | what is the performance of the difference parameter ,"
[37:22] mn005 | eh to classify
[37:22] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[37:27] mn005 | the the the front - end approach
"[37:32] mn005 | eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn ,"

[37:41] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:50] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[37:52] mn005 | Eh ?
"[37:53] mn005 | Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study"
[38:02] mn005 | to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters .
[38:04] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[38:07] me011 | What sort of classifier ar ?
"[38:08] mn005 | Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in"
[38:17] mn005 | a quantifier vectorial quantifier
"[38:19] mn005 | is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different ."
[38:28] mn005 | Is Yeah ?
[38:28] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:30] mn005 | W with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity ."
[38:37] mn005 | A another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network .
[38:41] me011 | Right .
[38:42] mn005 | But eh what 's the p
"[38:51] mn005 | w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm"
"[38:57] mn005 | to can test , to can eh observe what happened"
"[39:01] mn005 | you can't eh ,"
"[39:02] me011 | Right , you can't analyse it ."
"[39:05] mn005 | If you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh"
[39:09] mn005 | you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net .
"[39:12] me013 | Well , actually , you can do sensitivity analyses"
[39:15] me013 | which show you what the importance of the different parce pieces of the input are .
[39:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:18] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[39:19] me013 | It 's hard to w w what you It 's hard to tell on a neural net is what 's going on internally .
[39:25] mn005 | Yeah .
"[39:25] me013 | But it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs , especially if they 're all normalized ."
[39:30] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:31] mn005 | Yeah .
"[39:31] me013 | Um ,"
"[39:32] me011 | Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine ."
[39:35] mn005 | Yeah .
"[39:38] me013 | Yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one"
"[39:42] me013 | you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , in which case"
[39:44] me011 | Right .
[39:44] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:48] me011 | Right .
[39:48] mn005 | Yeah .
[39:53] me011 | Right .
[39:54] mn005 | I I I will include too the the the differential de derivates
"[39:57] me011 | Deltas , yeah . So ."
[39:59] mn005 | too .
[40:05] me013 | I would take
"[40:05] me013 | just a few features . Instead of taking all the MFCC 's , or all the PLP 's or whatever ,"
[40:09] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:10] me013 | I would just take a couple .
"[40:12] me013 | OK ? Like like C - one , C - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it ."
[40:16] me013 | and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots .
[40:19] mn005 | Yeah .
"[40:19] me013 | OK , so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers ,"
"[40:22] me013 | just take a look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart ."
[40:27] me013 | That I think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier .
[40:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:33] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:38] me013 | @ @
"[40:41] me013 | So if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you don't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so"
[40:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:47] me013 | you may wanna build @ @ build a Markov model of some sort
[40:50] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:51] me013 | or else have features that really are based on
[40:53] mn005 | Yeah .
[40:54] me013 | um
"[40:59] me013 | But don't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , you know ,"
[41:00] mn005 | Yeah .
"[41:02] me013 | throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that"
"[41:04] mn005 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[41:07] me013 | even if it 's K - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know what it 's doing , even You know it 's not a neural net ."
"[41:12] me013 | Uh , I think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's doing , you wanna look at it ."
"[41:29] me013 | like , uh , the residual the energy in the residual ."
[41:32] mn005 | Yeah .
[41:33] me013 | Um
[41:34] mn005 | Yeah .
[41:35] fe008 | Can I ask ? It strikes me that there 's another piece of information
[41:35] me013 | So .
[41:35] mn005 | S
"[41:37] fe008 | um , that"
[41:38] fe008 | might be useful and that 's simply the transition .
"[41:40] fe008 | So , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech ,"
[41:45] mn005 | Yeah yeah .
"[41:46] fe008 | there 's gonna be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me ."
[41:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[41:48] mn005 | Yeah .
"[41:49] mn005 | I Yeah . But eh I I Is my my my own vision , of the of the project ."
[41:54] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:56] mn005 | eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me ,"
"[41:59] mn005 | has eh , two"
[42:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:05] mn005 | a great project . But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project ,"
[42:11] mn005 | you eh we have eh
[42:13] mn005 | two main eh objective .
"[42:15] mn005 | One one of these is to eh to detect the change , the acoustic change ."
"[42:21] mn005 | And for that , if you don't use , eh ,"
"[42:26] mn005 | eh broad class , or not broad class"
"[42:31] mn005 | to label the different frames ,"
[42:33] mn005 | I think the Ike criterion
[42:38] fe008 | OK .
[42:38] mn005 | eh
[42:39] mn005 | will be enough
[42:41] mn005 | to detect the change .
[42:44] mn005 | I I I I would like to to t prove .
"[42:47] mn005 | Uh , probably ."
[42:48] mn005 | When you
"[42:49] mn005 | you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence"
"[42:53] mn005 | eh to overlap zone ,"
[42:55] mn005 | this criterion is enough
[42:59] mn005 | eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh
"[43:04] mn005 | em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC ."
[43:10] mn005 | you you have to to to find you can find
[43:13] mn005 | the the mark .
"[43:14] mn005 | You can find the nnn , the the acoustic change ."
[43:17] mn005 | But eh eh
"[43:18] mn005 | I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify ,"
[43:23] mn005 | to know that eh that zone
"[43:29] mn005 | that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone ."
[43:35] mn005 | because in the future you will eh
[43:36] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[43:38] mn005 | try to to process that zone
[43:46] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[43:48] mn005 | to to to process the overlapping z eh zone
"[43:59] mn005 | from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer ."
"[44:03] mn005 | That , you know , I I I think is the idea ."
[44:06] mn005 | And so
[44:07] mn005 | eh
[44:14] mn005 | the system
[44:17] mn005 | two models .
[44:18] mn005 | A model to detect
[44:20] mn005 | more acc the mor most accurately possible
"[44:23] mn005 | that is p uh , will be possible"
[44:28] fe008 | OK .
"[44:38] mn005 | eh several model eh robust models , sample models"
[44:42] mn005 | to try to classify
[44:44] mn005 | the difference class .
"[44:46] me011 | I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said . What what model ?"
"[44:48] mn005 | Eh , the the classifiers"
[44:50] mn005 | of the of the n
[44:52] mn005 | to detect the different class
[44:54] mn005 | to the different zones
[44:56] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:56] mn005 | before try to to recognize , eh"
"[44:59] mn005 | with eh to transcribe , with eh"
[45:00] mn005 | a speech recognizer .
"[45:02] mn005 | And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net"
[45:11] mn005 | with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study
[45:16] me011 | Features . Yeah .
[45:18] mn005 | of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put
[45:25] mn005 | the class of each frame .
[45:28] mn005 | Eh for the difference zone
[45:35] mn005 | have obtained
[45:37] mn005 | in the first
[45:37] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:38] mn005 | eh , step"
[45:44] mn005 | compare model
[45:48] fe008 | Yeah .
[45:49] mn005 | i
"[45:52] me013 | Because what we had before for for uh , speaker change detection did not include these overlaps ."
[45:57] mn005 | Yeah .
[45:58] me013 | So the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps .
[46:01] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:01] me013 | Right ? So again , I think"
[46:08] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:11] me013 | again , the things you 've written up there I think are way too way too big ."
[46:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:14] me013 | OK ? If you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order uh MFCC 's or something like that it 's just way too much . You won't be able to look at it ."
[46:19] mn005 | Yeah .
[46:20] me013 | All you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does .
[46:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[46:24] me013 | Whereas I think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional
"[46:27] me013 | things , or three of you have some very fancy display ,"
"[46:31] me013 | uh , and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on ."
[46:37] mn005 | It will be enough .
[46:41] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:47] me013 | and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second ,"
[46:51] mn005 | Yeah .
"[46:55] me013 | first and second - order cepstral coefficients , right ? And with LPC , I think LPC per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than than the other , maybe ."
[46:57] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:08] me013 | will say how well , uh"
"[47:16] me013 | people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one ."
[47:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:18] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:20] mn005 | Yeah .
"[47:33] me013 | uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , I now have ten likely candidates . """
[47:38] me013 | And then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine .
[47:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:40] mn005 | Yeah .
[47:41] mn005 | Yeah . This -
[47:41] me018 | I 've got a question .
"[47:44] mn005 | but eh , eh"
"[47:51] mn005 | and I would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion ."
[47:54] mn005 | Eh
"[47:55] mn005 | all this study in the f in the first moment ,"
[47:58] mn005 | I I w I I will pretend to do with eh eh
[48:02] mn005 | equalizes speech .
"[48:03] mn005 | The the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech ."
[48:04] fe008 | With what ? With what ?
[48:07] me011 | Right . Mixed .
"[48:09] fe008 | "" Mixed "" . Thank you ."
"[48:14] mn005 | more eh a lot eh clearer ,"
[48:16] mn005 | very much clearer if we compare with the PDA .
[48:19] me011 | Right .
[48:23] fe008 | So it 's messier .
[48:24] fe008 | The the PDA is messier .
[48:25] mn005 | Because the n the noise eh to sp the signal - to - noise relation is eh is is low .
[48:29] me013 | OK .
"[48:31] me011 | Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start . But ."
[48:44] me011 | It would be interesting in itself to see .
[48:45] mn005 | eh will work exactly with the eh PDA files .
"[48:50] mn005 | eh What , I I mean , what what is the effect"
"[48:50] me011 | Well , I think that would be an interesting result ."
[48:50] me013 | N u
[48:51] me013 | We -
[48:54] mn005 | of the low
"[48:58] me013 | Well , I think I think I think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . It makes sense to start with the simpler signal"
[49:05] me013 | because if you have features which don't aren't even
[49:08] me013 | helpful
[49:15] mn005 | Yeah .
"[49:17] me013 | Uh again , my prescription would be"
"[49:19] me013 | that you would , with a mixed"
"[49:21] me013 | signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features"
"[49:26] me013 | look at them ,"
[49:30] mn005 | Yeah .
"[49:31] me013 | and then collect , uh in pairs ,"
[49:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[49:36] me013 | with a bigger classifier .
"[49:37] me013 | And then if you can get that to work well ,"
[49:39] me013 | then you go to the other signal .
"[49:41] me013 | And then , and you and you know , they won't work as well , but"
[49:41] mn005 | Yeah .
[49:42] me011 | Right .
[49:45] mn005 | Yeah .
"[49:45] me013 | And then you can re - optimize , and so on ."
[49:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[49:47] me011 | Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both .
[49:50] me013 | Hmm .
"[49:54] mn005 | Ah , yeah , yeah yeah yeah . @ @"
"[49:56] me013 | It it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . Sure ."
[50:03] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:05] mn005 | I I I I think that the the eh parameter we found , eh ,"
[50:09] mn005 | worked
[50:10] mn005 | with both
[50:14] mn005 | the relation of eh of the
"[50:16] mn005 | performance when eh you use eh the , eh"
[50:16] me013 | Hmm .
[50:22] me013 | Right .
[50:23] mn005 | I I I I think it will be important .
"[50:26] mn005 | Because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . Is eh is not easy"
"[50:37] mn005 | I have seen the the the speech file from eh PDA , and s"
[50:42] mn005 | some parts is very difficult because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram . Is very difficult to apply
[50:47] me011 | Right .
"[50:47] me011 | Yeah , they 're totally hidden ."
[50:48] me013 | Yeah .
[50:50] me013 | Yeah .
"[50:50] mn005 | eh , eh"
"[50:59] me013 | things like harmonicity , and residual energy are"
"[50:59] mn005 | Yeah , yeah yeah , I I I will put eh the energy here ."
[51:05] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:07] mn005 | Yeah .
[51:08] me013 | Ch - Chuck was gonna ask something I guess .
[51:09] mn005 | Yeah . You have a question . Yeah .
"[51:10] me018 | Yeah , I maybe this is a dumb question , but"
"[51:14] me018 | w I thought it would be I thought it would be easier if you used a PDA because can't you , couldn't you like use"
[51:14] me013 | Nah .
[51:20] me018 | beam - forming or something to detect speaker overlaps ?
"[51:25] me011 | Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one ."
[51:28] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[51:31] me013 | In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information ."
[51:36] me013 | which we don't have with the one
[51:40] me018 | Is that not allowed with this project ?
[51:45] me018 | But I didn't mean I w Given given the goal .
[51:49] mn005 | Oh .
[51:50] me013 | I I think I think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question .
[51:50] mn005 | No .
[51:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[51:54] me013 | I mean , I think you wanna know whether you can do it with one , because"
[51:58] me013 | you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two .
[52:03] me018 | Mm - hmm
[52:04] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:04] me013 | Uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point ."
[52:09] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:09] me013 | But , we don't n even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is . You know , maybe it doesn't matter too much ."
[52:14] me018 | Right . Right .
[52:15] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:16] me013 | So , this is all pretty early stages . But no , you 're absolutely right . That 's a good thing to consider ."
[52:16] me018 | OK .
[52:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:17] me018 | I see .
"[52:17] mn005 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[52:18] me018 | OK .
"[52:19] fe008 | There there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the PDA , then some of the positional information goes away ?"
[52:26] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:30] fe008 | And if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing I was thinking ."
[52:31] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:33] fe008 | He You mentioned this last time , that that if if you 're straight down the midline ,"
"[52:36] fe008 | then then the r the left - right 's gonna be different , and and and in his case ,"
"[52:37] me018 | Well , it 's -"
[52:38] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:40] mn005 | Yeah .
"[52:40] fe008 | I mean , he 's closer to it anyway . It seems to me that that it 's not a p uh , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated ."
[52:42] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:44] me011 | But it 's another source of information .
[52:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[52:47] me018 | I don't I don't know ho
[52:47] mn005 | I I I think Sorry .
[52:49] mn005 | I I I think because the the the distance between the two microph
"[52:53] mn005 | eh , microphone , eh , in the PDA is"
"[52:57] mn005 | from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea"
[53:00] mn005 | to to try to study the binaural
"[53:02] mn005 | eh problem eh , with information , because I I found"
[53:05] me011 | Yep .
[53:07] mn005 | difference between the the speech from from each micro
"[53:10] mn005 | eh , in the PDA ."
"[53:12] me013 | Yeah , it 's timing difference . It - it 's not amplitude , right ?"
[53:13] fe008 | Oh yeah ! Oh I agree ! And we use it ourselves .
[53:15] me013 | S
[53:16] me011 | Yep .
[53:17] me013 | Right .
[53:17] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:17] fe008 | But I 'm just I 'm just saying that
"[53:19] fe008 | the way we 're seated around a table ,"
[53:20] fe008 | is not the same
"[53:22] fe008 | with respect to each to each person with respect to the PDA , so we 're gonna have"
[53:23] mn005 | No . No .
"[53:24] mn005 | No , no , no ."
[53:25] fe008 | a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker .
"[53:27] me018 | But th I don't think that matters , though ."
[53:27] me013 | That 's fine .
"[53:30] me013 | I think the issue is ,"
"[53:31] me013 | "" Is there a clean signal coming from only one direction ? """
[53:34] me018 | Right .
"[53:36] me013 | If it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if th if there 's a broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,"
[53:43] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:43] me013 | wherever they are .
[53:44] me018 | So it 's sort of like how how confused is it
[53:47] me018 | about where the beam is .
[53:47] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:48] me013 | Is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern ?
[53:56] fe008 | OK .
"[53:56] me013 | Wherever you are , even if he moves around ."
[53:56] mn005 | Yeah .
[53:57] fe008 | Yeah .
"[54:01] fe008 | uh ,"
[54:05] fe008 | I can see the value o
[54:08] mn005 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[54:08] me013 | But the thing is just having two mikes If you looked at that thing on on Dan 's page ,"
[54:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[54:12] me013 | it was When when there were two people speaking , and it looked really really different ."
[54:15] me011 | Yep .
[54:16] mn005 | Yeah .
[54:16] me018 | What looked different ?
"[54:17] me013 | Uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation ."
[54:19] me013 | Just cross - correlation between two sides .
"[54:19] mn005 | Correlation , yeah ."
"[54:21] me018 | Did - Sorry , b uh"
"[54:25] fe008 | Uh , his a web page ."
[54:26] me013 | You take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags .
[54:30] me018 | OK .
[54:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[54:31] mn005 | Yeah .
[54:31] me018 | Uh - huh .
[54:31] me013 | OK .
"[54:32] me013 | So when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking ,"
[54:40] me018 | OK . OK .
"[54:42] me013 | at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there ,"
[54:46] me013 | you get this boost in the in in the cross - correlation value function .
"[54:48] me011 | And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks ."
[54:51] me013 | It 's spread out .
"[54:52] fe008 | Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there ,"
[54:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[54:55] me013 | Yeah .
[54:55] mn005 | Yeah .
"[54:59] me013 | The - the Oh , I 'm sorry , if they 're right next to one another ? i i"
"[55:01] me018 | If I was if I was here and Morgan was there and we were both talking ,"
[55:01] fe008 | Next next one over n over on this side of the P PDA .
[55:04] fe008 | There we go .
[55:04] me011 | Right .
[55:04] mn005 | Yeah . Yeah .
[55:04] me018 | it wouldn't work .
"[55:04] fe008 | Good example , the same one I 'm asking ."
"[55:05] me013 | Yeah , e I see ."
[55:06] mn005 | Yeah .
"[55:06] fe008 | Versus you versus you know , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and I 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one ."
[55:06] me018 | Yes .
"[55:11] me011 | Or or even if , like ,"
[55:11] mn005 | Yeah . Yeah .
[55:12] fe008 | It seems like that would be pretty strong .
[55:12] mn005 | Yeah .
"[55:13] me011 | if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either ."
[55:14] mn005 | Yeah .
"[55:14] fe008 | Across the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate ."
[55:17] mn005 | Yeah .
"[55:17] me013 | Well ,"
[55:20] me011 | Right .
[55:20] fe008 | differentially varia valuable .
"[55:22] fe008 | I mean , it 's not to say I mean , I certainly think it 's extremely val And we we humans n n depend on you know , these these binaural cues . But ."
"[55:27] mn005 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[55:31] me013 | I think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . There 's a sensitivity issue , and then there 's a pathological error uh issue ."
[55:36] me011 | Yeah .
[55:37] me013 | So th the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error . If someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it .
[55:39] fe008 | Yes .
[55:41] mn005 | Yeah .
[55:41] fe008 | Yeah .
"[55:44] me013 | Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity ."
[55:48] me011 | Yep .
[55:49] fe008 | Yeah .
[55:49] fe008 | OK .
"[55:54] fe008 | Yeah yeah , OK ."
[55:54] mn005 | Yeah .
[55:55] me013 | Yeah .
[55:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[55:58] fe008 | that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible"
[56:02] fe008 | to get it perfect for everybody .
"[56:04] me011 | he wrote me about it a little bit , so ."
"[56:06] fe008 | Great . No , I don't mean to discourage that at all ."
"[56:07] me013 | I mean , the other thing you can do uh , if I mean , i We 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the PDA ."
[56:20] mn005 | Yeah .
[56:22] me018 | Well what about just doing it from these mikes ?
[56:22] fe008 | Interesting .
[56:24] me018 | You know ?
[56:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[56:25] me011 | Yep .
[56:28] me013 | Uh
[56:32] me011 | Then they 're much broader .
"[56:33] me013 | I mean , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study ."
"[56:36] me011 | Yeah , we can do whatever we want ."
[56:36] mn005 | Yeah .
"[56:38] me013 | but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things I was hoping to get at with this is what"
[56:43] me013 | can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a PDA .
[56:46] mn005 | Yeah .
"[56:48] me018 | That 's what I was asking about , what are the constraints ?"
[56:48] mn005 | Yeah . Yeah .
[56:49] me013 | Right .
[56:49] mn005 | Yeah .
"[56:50] me013 | Yeah . Well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that I think both Adam and I were were were interested in ."
[56:50] mn005 | Yeah .
[56:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[56:55] me011 | Yep .
[56:56] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[56:56] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:02] me011 | Big micro @ @ arrays .
[57:04] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:07] me018 | Didn't they have something at Cape ? Uh .
"[57:07] me013 | um and at Cape ,"
"[57:10] me013 | they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . And you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place"
[57:13] me011 | Very finely .
[57:19] me018 | Oh ! I saw a demo .
"[57:19] mn005 | Oh , right , oh , yeah ."
"[57:23] me011 | Oh , I saw one that was like"
[57:26] me013 | Yeah .
[57:26] mn005 | Hundred .
"[57:26] me018 | And you could In a noisy room , they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody ."
[57:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:28] me013 | Yeah .
[57:29] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:30] me011 | Right .
[57:30] me013 | Ye - Pretty much . Yeah .
[57:31] me011 | It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it .
[57:33] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:35] me013 | Yeah .
[57:35] me018 | That is cool .
[57:35] mn005 | Yeah .
"[57:36] me011 | It was yeah , it was interesting ."
"[57:36] me013 | But ,"
[57:37] me013 | the reason why I haven't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because
"[57:41] me013 | um , I 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion ."
"[57:48] me013 | And you can't just always go , "" well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up "" ."
[57:53] mn005 | Yeah .
[57:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[57:54] me018 | No , what you need to do is you 'd have"
[57:56] me018 | a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . It has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the PDA .
[58:03] fe008 | Interesting .
"[58:04] me013 | The other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else I 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two P D As and they communicate with each other ?"
[58:08] me011 | Yep .
[58:09] mn005 | Yeah .
"[58:10] me013 | And then You know , they 're in random positions , the likelihood that I mean , basically there wouldn't be any l likely to be any kind of nulls , if you even had two ."
[58:14] me011 | That 's on my web pages . Yeah .
[58:15] me018 | Network !
[58:16] fe008 | Interesting .
"[58:18] me011 | All sorts of interesting things you can do with that , I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um"
[58:18] fe008 | Interesting .
[58:21] fe008 | Hmm .
[58:24] me011 | multi - band
[58:25] mn005 | Yeah .
[58:25] me013 | Yeah .
[58:25] me011 | as well .
[58:25] fe008 | Ah !
[58:26] me011 | So it 's it would be neat .
[58:31] me018 | Yeah !
[58:32] me018 | Hats ?
[58:35] me011 | it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .
[58:35] me018 | Shirts .
"[58:37] me011 | So if if Jose is interested in that , that 's great . But if if"
[58:40] me013 | Yeah .
"[58:41] me011 | he 's not , that 's great too ."
"[58:43] mn005 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[58:44] me013 | Um , I i I i"
"[58:45] me013 | I would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still"
"[58:49] me013 | get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there ."
[58:51] me011 | Um .
[58:52] me013 | OK .
"[58:52] me011 | Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out . One is , do we need to sign new these again ?"
"[58:56] fe008 | Well , it 's slightly different . So I I would say it would be a good idea ."
[59:00] fe008 | Cuz it it 's slightly different .
[59:00] me018 | Are they new ?
[59:01] me011 | Yep .
[59:01] me018 | Oh .
"[59:02] me013 | Oh , this morning we didn't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we didn't have to ."
"[59:06] me011 | Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed ."
[59:07] fe008 | It 's slightly different .
[59:10] me011 | So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .
[59:12] mn005 | OK .
"[59:13] me011 | Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing ."
"[59:18] me011 | But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off ."
[59:21] me011 | Um
"[59:22] me011 | and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data ."
[59:26] me011 | Uh .
"[59:26] fe008 | I mean I have some results to present , but I mean I guess we won't have time to do that this time ."
"[59:30] fe008 | But it seems like um the anonymization is uh ,"
[59:34] fe008 | is also something that we might wanna discuss in greater length .
"[59:39] fe008 | If if we 're about to wind down , I think what I would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and I would like to present"
[59:46] fe008 | the results that I have on the overlaps .
"[59:48] me018 | We still have to do this , too , right ?"
[59:50] me013 | Right .
[59:51] me018 | Digits ?
[59:52] me013 | Right .
"[59:53] me011 | No - well , we don't have to do digits ."
"[00:02] me013 | Uh ,"
[00:03] me013 | so
[00:03] me013 | @ @
[00:05] me013 | It sounds like u
"[00:11] me011 | OK , go ahead , Jane ."
"[00:13] fe008 | I 'd Oh , I 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e"
[00:15] fe008 | Could I do that next week maybe ?
[00:16] me013 | OK .
"[00:17] me013 | Oh , yeah . Sure ."
"[00:17] fe008 | OK , that 's what I 'm asking ."
"[00:18] me013 | Oh yeah , yeah ."
"[00:19] fe008 | And I think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , I just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also"
[00:24] fe008 | n
[00:25] me013 | We could s
[00:27] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[00:36] me011 | We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it"
"[00:41] fe008 | Well , OK ."
"[00:45] fe008 | I I 'll give you the short version , but I do think it 's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes ."
[00:49] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[00:51] fe008 | the the short thing is
"[00:53] fe008 | um , we have"
"[00:54] fe008 | uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings ."
"[00:57] fe008 | Those we won't be able to change . If someone says "" Hey , Roger so - and - so "" ."
[01:00] me011 | Right .
[01:01] fe008 | So that 's gonna stay that person 's name .
[01:02] me011 | Yep .
"[01:05] fe008 | the question becomes what symbol are you gonna put in there for everybody 's name ,"
"[01:09] fe008 | and whether you 're gonna put it in the text where he says "" Hey Roger "" or are we gonna put that person 's anonymized name in instead ?"
"[01:15] me011 | No , because then that would give you a mapping ,"
[01:17] me011 | and you don't wanna have a mapping .
"[01:17] fe008 | OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name"
[01:21] fe008 | for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .
[01:24] me011 | No .
"[01:25] me011 | Because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using ,"
[01:30] me011 | OK .
"[01:31] fe008 | uh , so in within the context of an utterance , someone says "" So , Roger , what do you think ? """
[01:37] fe008 | OK .
"[01:42] fe008 | Well , maybe I uh it seems to me that if you change the name ,"
"[01:45] fe008 | the transcript 's gonna disagree with the audio , and you won't be able to use that ."
"[01:47] me011 | We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be "" Roger "" ."
"[01:47] me018 | Right , you don't wanna do that ."
"[01:50] me011 | Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger ,"
[01:51] me018 | Yeah .
[01:54] me011 | someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping
"[01:57] me011 | between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that ."
"[01:59] fe008 | OK , well , but then"
"[02:00] fe008 | there 's this issue of if we 're gonna use this for a discourse type of thing ,"
"[02:05] fe008 | and , you know , Liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all ,"
[02:11] me011 | Oh .
"[02:12] fe008 | then to have "" Roger "" be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was "" Roger "" be "" Frank "" ,"
[02:18] fe008 | that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .
[02:22] me011 | Ugh ! That 's a good point .
[02:41] me013 | Yeah
"[02:42] fe008 | And and I cer and I So , I mean , the question then becomes one level back ."
"[02:45] fe008 | Um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ?"
"[02:50] fe008 | Well ,"
"[02:51] fe008 | on the one hand ,"
"[02:52] fe008 | uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions ,"
[02:55] fe008 | um
"[02:56] fe008 | and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they don't like OK ."
"[03:02] fe008 | So , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . On the other hand ,"
"[03:06] fe008 | this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic X"
"[03:11] fe008 | e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name ."
"[03:16] fe008 | However , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names ."
[03:20] me011 | Right .
[03:21] mn005 | Mmm .
[03:23] fe008 | You know ?
"[03:24] fe008 | Now , in terms of like so I I did some results , which I 'll report on n next time ,"
[03:28] fe008 | which do mention individual speakers by name .
[03:30] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:30] fe008 | Now , there , the Human Subjects Committee is very precise ."
[03:34] fe008 | You don't wanna mention subjects by name
[03:36] fe008 | in published reports .
"[03:38] fe008 | Now , it would be very possible for me to take those data"
"[03:40] fe008 | put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication ."
"[03:44] me013 | Yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . You can go , you know , uh , "" Z "" uh , for instance . Uh ."
"[03:54] me013 | I mean , I 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript ."
[03:55] fe008 | That 's the same thing you saw .
[03:56] me011 | OK . @ @
"[03:59] me013 | Uh , I think you don't wanna have their full name to be uh ,"
"[04:03] fe008 | Yeah , and and in the form that they sign ,"
[04:04] me011 | Yeah .
"[04:05] fe008 | it does say "" your first name may arise in the course of the meetings "" ."
[04:08] me013 | Yeah .
"[04:09] me013 | So again , th the issue is if you 're tracking discourse things , you know , if someone says , uh , uh , "" Frank said this "" and then you wanna connect it to something later , you 've gotta have this part where that 's "" Frank colon "" . Right ?"
"[04:09] fe008 | Or "" your name "" ."
"[04:19] fe008 | Yeah , and and you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just"
"[04:24] fe008 | being able to ,"
"[04:26] fe008 | Well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking"
"[04:32] fe008 | to whom , cuz that can be important . S"
[04:33] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:34] fe008 | i You know , "" You raised the point , So - and - so "" , it 's be kind of nice to"
[04:36] me013 | Yeah .
[04:38] me011 | I I 'm thinking too much .
"[04:38] fe008 | and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how"
"[04:42] fe008 | you know , I was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names ,"
"[04:44] me013 | Yeah , I was too . Yeah ."
[04:53] me011 | Yep .
[04:54] me013 | Yeah .
[04:54] mn005 | Yeah .
"[04:54] me011 | Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript , but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point ."
[04:56] fe008 | Misleading .
[05:00] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:03] me011 | You 're right , this is going to require more thought ."
[05:05] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:06] me013 | L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting ."
"[05:13] me013 | I mean , I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about ."
"[05:19] me013 | and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random ,"
[05:22] me013 | frankly . So I think what would be helpful would be
"[05:25] me013 | uh ,"
[05:25] me013 | i
"[05:26] me013 | and I 'll I 'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too ,"
"[05:29] me013 | that um ,"
"[05:30] me013 | before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , uh , uh ,"
[05:34] me013 | agenda items that they were interested in
[05:35] fe008 | OK .
[05:36] fe008 | Sure .
[05:37] me013 | and I 'll I 'll take the role of organizing them
"[05:39] me013 | uh , into into the agenda ,"
"[05:43] me013 | completely make up the agenda . I 've no desire to to make it up , but"
"[05:51] me013 | and uh ,"
[05:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:53] fe008 | Oh , it 's not a problem . Not a problem . Yeah ."
"[05:56] me013 | I mean , I 'm just always asking Jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's There 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on ."
[06:02] me011 | How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript
[06:06] me011 | even know who they 're talking about ?
[06:10] me011 | Do you know what I 'm saying ?
"[06:11] me018 | "" The person who 's doing the transcript "" The IBM people ?"
[06:13] me011 | Yeah .
"[06:14] me011 | I mean , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ?"
"[06:18] fe008 | How do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ?"
[06:20] fe008 | How do you mean ?
"[06:20] me011 | I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , "" oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so "" ,"
"[06:28] me011 | Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write "" Bob "" ."
[06:30] me011 | And so .
[06:30] fe008 | They won't be able to change it themselves .
"[06:32] me011 | If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , a"
[06:35] me013 | What ar how are they gonna do any of this ?
"[06:37] fe008 | Well , I I 'm betting we 're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un"
[06:41] fe008 | untranscribable by them .
"[06:44] me011 | Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity ."
[06:45] me018 | They can't do that .
"[06:47] me011 | because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person ."
[06:52] me011 | and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions .
[06:56] me013 | So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words .
[06:58] fe008 | Oh . I think that My understanding from Yen -
[06:58] me011 | Yep .
"[07:03] me013 | Uh Yu - Ching , Yu - Ching . Yeah ."
[07:04] me011 | y Yu - Ching .
"[07:05] fe008 | was that um , they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed ,"
[07:10] fe008 | where they put speaker identifier down .
"[07:13] fe008 | But , you know , h they won't know these people , so I think"
"[07:16] fe008 | it 's Well , they 'll they 'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified"
[07:19] fe008 | to them So they 'll do something
"[07:20] fe008 | like speaker - one , speaker - two , is what I bet , but I 'm betting there 'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers . We 'll have to review the transcripts in any case ."
"[07:27] me013 | And it and it may very well be I mean , since"
"[07:30] me013 | they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker ,"
[07:35] fe008 | Yeah .
"[07:35] me013 | they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . And the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one ."
"[07:44] fe008 | You know , that would be a very practical solution on their part ."
[07:46] mn005 | Yeah . It 's a good idea .
[07:46] fe008 | And and but then we would need to label it . And that 's OK .
[07:47] me013 | Yeah .
[07:48] me011 | Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes .
"[07:51] fe008 | Yes , I was thinking , the temp the time values of when it changes ."
[07:52] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:52] me013 | Yeah .
[07:53] mn005 | Yeah .
[07:55] fe008 | That 'd be very efficient .
[07:56] me011 | This doesn't answer the the question .
[07:58] me011 | The p
"[07:58] me011 | It 's a good point , "" which what do you do for discourse tracking ? """
[08:01] mn005 | you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers . You only
[08:02] me011 | Hmm .
[08:08] me011 | For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do .
"[08:08] me013 | Well , you do ."
"[08:11] mn005 | Ah , for discourse , yeah ."
"[08:11] me013 | Yeah . If if if if someone says , uh , "" what what is Jose doing ? "" and then Jose says something , you need to know that that was Jose responding ."
[08:12] mn005 | Yeah .
[08:13] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:18] mn005 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[08:19] mn005 | Yeah .
"[08:20] mn005 | Yeah ,"
[08:21] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[08:21] mn005 | @ @ Yeah .
"[08:22] me011 | Ugh , that 's a problem ."
"[08:23] fe008 | Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name , which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit ."
[08:31] me018 | That would be hard .
"[08:32] fe008 | Well , people are very flexible . You know ? I mean , so when we did this las last week , I felt that you know , now , Andreas may , uh ,"
"[08:44] fe008 | and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name . So , people are really flexible ."
[08:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[08:57] mn005 | Yeah .
"[09:00] me018 | Or , you I think said , you know , or s Liz , said something about um , uh , "" is Mari gonna use the equipment ? """
[09:07] fe008 | Yeah ?
"[09:07] me018 | I mean , how would you say that ?"
"[09:10] me018 | I mean , you have to really think ,"
"[09:12] me018 | you know , about what you 're saying bef"
[09:12] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:16] me018 | Yeah . Yeah .
[09:16] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:17] me018 | I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names ,"
"[09:19] me011 | Yeah , darn ! I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names ."
"[09:21] fe008 | Well , it"
[09:21] me018 | plus we 'd have to tell everybody else .
[09:23] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:25] me018 | Right .
[09:26] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[09:27] me013 | Yeah .
[09:27] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:27] fe008 | Yeah .
[09:28] fe008 | That 's that 's the issue .
"[09:30] me018 | I don't know , my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what 's in"
"[09:35] me018 | the recordings ,"
[09:36] me018 | you only anonymize
"[09:38] me018 | to the extent you can ,"
[09:40] me018 | the speakers have signed the forms and all .
"[09:40] me011 | Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse ."
[09:41] fe008 | Well .
[09:46] me013 | Yeah . Th -
[09:46] me018 | Why ?
[09:46] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:47] me013 | Bec -
[09:47] me011 | Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to .
[09:49] mn005 | Yeah .
[09:56] me018 | Why do you have to know his name ?
"[10:02] me013 | uh , what Jose said . """
[10:04] me018 | Yeah .
[10:05] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:05] me013 | And then , Jose responds ."
[10:07] me018 | Yeah .
[10:07] me013 | And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it .
"[10:10] me013 | But it doesn't say "" Jose "" , it says "" speaker - five "" ."
[10:14] me018 | OK .
[10:14] me013 | So uh u
[10:14] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:16] me018 | Oh , I see , you wanna associated the word "" Jose "" in the dialogue with"
[10:20] me018 | the fact that then he responded .
[10:22] me013 | Right .
"[10:23] me013 | And so , if we pass out the data to someone else ,"
[10:23] me011 | Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that .
"[10:27] me013 | and it says "" speaker - five "" there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is Jose ,"
[10:32] me011 | And that violates our privacy .
[10:32] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:34] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:35] fe008 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[10:35] me011 | And that violates our privacy issue .
[10:35] mn005 | Yeah .
[10:36] mn005 | Yeah .
"[10:37] fe008 | Now , I I think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , University of Washington 's use , IBM , SRI ."
[10:39] me013 | Yeah .
"[10:44] fe008 | And within that ,"
"[10:45] fe008 | it may be that it 's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet ,"
[10:51] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:52] fe008 | but always , always in the publications we have to ."
"[10:55] fe008 | And I think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to ."
"[11:05] fe008 | i i it You know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually X out that part of the um the audio , and just put in brackets "" speaker - one "" ."
[11:08] me011 | Yeah .
[11:10] me011 | For the public one .
[11:11] mn005 | the ? ?
[11:14] fe008 | You know .
[11:14] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:14] me011 | You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . One that 's public"
[11:18] me011 | and one one that requires licensing .
[11:21] me011 | And so the licensed one would w we could it would be a sticky limitation .
[11:23] fe008 | Uh - huh .
"[11:25] me011 | You know , like Well , we can talk about that later ."
"[11:28] fe008 | I think that when we do that world release , it should be the same ."
[11:29] me013 | I I agree .
"[11:31] me013 | I I agree with Jane . I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort ,"
"[11:32] fe008 | For a bunch of reasons , legal ."
[11:37] fe008 | But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important .
[11:38] mn005 | Yeah .
"[11:38] me018 | Well , one thing to to take into consideration is"
[11:41] me018 | w are there any
"[11:43] me018 | um For example , the people who are funding this work ,"
"[11:46] me018 | they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse ,"
"[11:54] me011 | Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful ."
[11:59] me011 | because for discourse you don't need the audio .
[12:01] me011 | Right ? So you could bleep out the names in the audio .
[12:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[12:04] me011 | and use the anonymized one through the transcript .
[12:06] me013 | Uh .
"[12:09] me011 | But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names ."
"[12:12] me013 | No , but she 's saying , from the argument before , she wants to be able to say if someone said "" Jose "" in their in their thing , and then connect to so to what he said later , then you need it ."
"[12:18] me011 | Right . But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said "" Jose """
[12:24] me011 | that you could
"[12:25] me011 | replace it with "" speaker - seven "" ."
[12:27] me013 | Oh I see .
[12:29] me013 | I see .
[12:32] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[12:33] fe008 | Yeah . That 's good .
[12:37] me011 | Right .
"[12:38] me013 | And th and the other thing is if if if Liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , and so , uh , yeah ."
"[12:38] fe008 | Well , you see ? So , it 's complicated ."
[12:48] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[12:48] fe008 | Yeah . I think we have to think about w
[12:49] me013 | Sorry .
[12:51] fe008 | how . I think that this can't be decided today .
"[12:53] me011 | Yeah , OK , good point ."
[12:53] fe008 | But it 's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can
[12:55] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:57] me011 | I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms , but I guess it is ."
[12:57] mn005 | OK .
"[13:02] me013 | Yeah , a lot of these things are ."
"[13:04] me011 | Yeah , ab absolutely ."
"[13:09] me011 | Oh , yeah , sure ."
"[13:10] fe008 | You know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem ."
"[13:16] me018 | Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse ,"
[13:18] fe008 | So .
[13:22] mn005 | OK .
[13:27] mn005 | OK .
[13:33] me011 | Did you read the paper on Eurospeech ?
"[13:34] fe008 | We could have little labels . I I I wanna introduce my Reservoir Dogs solution again , which is everyone has like "" Mister White "" , "" Mister Pink "" , "" Mister Blue "" ."
[13:39] me011 | Yeah .
[13:41] me011 | Did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ?
[13:46] me011 | They were di they they had the utterances . and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards .
"[13:54] me018 | But so , the syllables were in the same order , with respect to each other , but the acous"
"[13:56] me011 | Everything was in the same order , but they were the individual syll syllables were played backwards ."
[14:01] me018 | What did it sound like ?
[14:03] me011 | People had no difficulty in interpreting it .
"[14:05] me011 | So what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it ."
[14:05] me018 | What ?
"[14:12] me013 | Oh , well that 's there 's an easy way to do that ."
"[14:18] me011 | Oh right . The speech recognizer 's totally symmetric , isn't it ."
"[14:21] me011 | Ah , anyway ."
"[14:23] me013 | Um ,"
"[14:23] fe008 | Oh , do we do digits ? Or ? What do we do ?"
"[14:25] me013 | Let 's do digits . Yeah , we we we already missed the party . So ."
"[14:25] me011 | Uh OK , we 'll quickly do digits ."
[14:25] fe008 | Or do we just quit ?
[14:27] me011 | OK .
[14:28] fe008 | Yeah .
"[17:41] me011 | OK , go off here ."
[17:42] me018 | I think it would be fun sometime to read them with different intonations .
[17:47] me018 | like as if you were talking
"[17:48] me018 | like , "" nine eight six eight seven ? """
"[17:59] fe008 | li So it was like "" nine eight two four , nine nine two four "" ."
"[18:02] me018 | Oh , really . So they were like looking ahead , huh ?"
"[18:06] fe008 | Well , they differed . I mean , at that that session I did feel like they did it more as sentences ."
"[18:13] fe008 | am sort of interested in in And sometimes , you know , I s"
[18:13] me011 | Yep .
"[18:13] me018 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[18:19] me018 | Well , I was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gonna have to transcribe this"
"[18:24] me011 | Well , except , yeah . We have the transcript . We have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that . OK , I 'm gonna go off ."
[18:25] me018 | They may as well throw in some interesting intonations .
[18:26] fe008 | I like your question intonation . That 's very funny . I haven't heard that one .

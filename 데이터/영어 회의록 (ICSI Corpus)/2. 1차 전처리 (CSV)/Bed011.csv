[00:02] mn015 | @ @
[00:04] mn015 | Now can you give me the uh remote T ?
"[00:46] me010 | OK , so Eva , co uh could you read your numbers ? Yeah ."
[00:48] fn050 | Go ahead and read .
[00:48] fn050 | OK .
[01:32] mn015 | Alright .
"[01:33] me010 | Yeah , let 's get started ."
"[01:36] me010 | Hopefully Nancy will come , if not , she won't ."
"[01:40] me045 | Uh , Robert , do you uh"
[01:42] me045 | have any way to turn off your uh
"[01:54] mn015 | and um I I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands ."
[01:59] me045 | OK .
[01:59] mn015 | It has a mind .
[02:01] me045 | Got it .
[02:02] fe046 | Wants to conserve .
[02:02] mn015 | But I
[02:08] mn015 | But uh we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen .
[02:14] mn015 | We 'll see .
[02:17] mn015 | Should we plunge right into it ?
[02:19] me010 | Yeah .
[02:19] me010 | I think so .
[02:21] mn015 | So what I 've tried to do here is
[02:23] mn015 | list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side .
[02:33] mn015 | the properties we may
[02:35] mn015 | um
[02:36] mn015 | give them .
[02:52] mn015 | The reading is out of these tasks
"[02:54] mn015 | more or less imply that the user wants to go there ,"
[02:58] mn015 | sometime or the other .
[03:00] mn015 | And analogously
"[03:02] mn015 | for example , here we have"
[03:05] mn015 | our
[03:06] mn015 | EVA
[03:07] mn015 | um intention .
[03:09] mn015 | And these are the
[03:12] mn015 | data tasks where w
"[03:14] mn015 | we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach"
[03:18] mn015 | the thing . Analogously
[03:20] mn015 | the same on the object information
"[03:23] mn015 | we can see that , you know , we have sort of"
[03:25] mn015 | created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous
"[03:34] mn015 | tasks , and that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every"
[03:46] mn015 | decision node so trying to im
"[03:53] mn015 | implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime"
"[04:01] mn015 | on the next tour , or the next day or whenever ."
[04:04] mn015 | But I think that might be overdoing it a little .
[04:06] me010 | Yeah . So let me pop up a level .
[04:09] me010 | And uh
[04:11] me010 | s s make sure that we 're all oriented
[04:14] me010 | the same . So
[04:16] me010 | What we 're gonna do today is two related things .
[04:20] me010 | Uh one of them is to work on
[04:26] me010 | the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system
[04:37] me010 | uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be
[04:42] me010 | parameter choices for calls on other modules .
[04:47] me010 | so f the natural language understanding thing
"[04:50] me010 | is uh , we think"
"[04:51] me010 | gonna only have to choose parameters , but"
"[04:55] me010 | You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount ."
[05:07] me010 | Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on
[05:12] me010 | the actual belief relations and
[05:14] me010 | presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today .
[05:23] me010 | another day . Probably next week .
[05:25] me010 | But we are gonna worry about
[05:27] me010 | all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And
"[05:33] me010 | we 're also , sort of uh in the same process ,"
[05:37] me010 | going to work with Fey on
[05:39] me010 | what there should be in the dialogues . So
[05:42] me010 | One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects
"[05:47] me010 | uh in here , and have them"
[05:53] me010 | actually record like this .
[05:55] me010 | Uh record dialogues more or less .
[05:59] me010 | depending on
"[06:00] me010 | what Fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things ."
"[06:07] mn015 | Well how people phrase different intentions more or less , huh ?"
"[06:11] me010 | Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use ,"
[06:16] me010 | uh we have some i we have some ways to
[06:19] me010 | affect that by the way the dialogues go .
"[06:23] me010 | So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out"
"[06:27] me010 | a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up ,"
"[06:36] me010 | and ,"
"[06:41] me010 | uh on the left are decision nodes ,"
[06:45] me010 | and
"[06:47] me010 | discreet values . So if if we 're right ,"
[06:50] me010 | you can get by with
[06:52] me010 | um
"[06:54] me010 | just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets"
[07:02] me010 | that will do that . And he has a handout .
"[07:05] mn015 | Yeah . Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because"
[07:08] me010 | Yeah .
"[07:08] mn015 | j we have two updates . Um you can look at this if you want , these are"
[07:13] mn015 | what our subject 's going to have to fill out . Any comments I can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .
"[07:21] mn015 | Let me summarize in two sentences , mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all . Or have you heard about it ?"
[07:26] fn050 | OK .
[07:28] fn050 | Not that much you didn't .
[07:29] mn015 | No .
[07:30] mn015 | OK . We were gonna put this in front of people . They give us some information on themselves .
[07:34] fn050 | OK .
[07:35] mn015 | Then then they will read uh a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between .
[07:42] mn015 | And um and they have to read isolated proper names
[07:46] me010 | S
"[07:49] mn015 | No , this is not the release form . This is the speaker"
"[07:50] me010 | Got it . OK , fine . OK ."
[07:51] mn015 | information form . The release form is over there in that box .
"[07:54] me010 | Alright , fair enough ."
[07:57] mn015 | And then they gonna have to f
[08:00] mn015 | um
[08:04] mn015 | um
"[08:05] mn015 | choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . They they pick a couple , say three uh uh six as a matter of fact ."
[08:23] mn015 | and they have a map .
[08:26] me045 | Hmm .
"[08:26] mn015 | Like this . Very sketchy , simplified map ."
[08:29] mn015 | And they can take notes on that map .
"[08:31] mn015 | And then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything ."
[08:34] fn050 | OK .
[08:39] mn015 | The comp
"[08:41] mn015 | Yeah , the computer system sits right in front of you , that 's Fey ."
[08:43] fe046 | Yes . I 've I understand everything . Yes I do .
"[08:46] mn015 | And she has a way of making this machine talk . So she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that . So if you ask "" How do I get to the castle "" then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here "" In order to get to the castle you do "" OK ?"
[09:08] mn015 | And then after three tasks the system breaks down .
[09:11] mn015 | And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator .
"[09:15] mn015 | And says "" Sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . "" And we sort of get the idea what"
"[09:20] mn015 | people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human ,"
[09:26] fn050 | OK .
[09:27] fn050 | Huh .
[09:27] me045 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[09:30] mn015 | That 's the data collection .
[09:35] mn015 | And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up ? Something ?
[09:38] fe046 | Yeah . And more and more every day .
[09:42] mn015 | And they 're r
[09:43] mn015 | ready uh to roll . And we 're gonna start tomorrow at three ? four ? one ?
[09:53] mn015 | OK . Around four - ish .
[09:55] mn015 | And um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room .
"[10:05] me010 | Well , there are these uh uh oh , I see , we have to Yeah , it 's tricky . We 'll let 's let we 'll do that off - line , OK ."
"[10:09] mn015 | Yeah , but I i i it 's happening . David and and Jane and and Lila are working on that as we speak ."
[10:12] me010 | OK .
[10:16] mn015 | OK .
[10:19] mn015 | the data collection in a nutshell .
[10:30] mn015 | I can report a so I did this but I also tried to do
"[10:36] mn015 | this so if I click on here , Isn't this wonderful ?"
[10:42] mn015 | uh belief - net just focusing on on the g
[10:45] mn015 | Go - there node . uh Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth . And what w
[10:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[10:54] mn015 | what happened is that
[10:56] mn015 | um
[11:00] mn015 | we still get a lot of
[11:02] mn015 | errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes .
"[11:09] mn015 | So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user . How much will he is he willing to spend ?"
"[11:24] mn015 | Or can spend . Being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there if it is you know charging"
[11:32] mn015 | tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e
[11:36] mn015 | whatever . Twenty - two million to fly to
"[11:39] mn015 | International Space Station , you know ."
[11:41] me010 | Right .
[11:42] mn015 | Not all people can do that .
"[11:44] mn015 | So , and this actually turned out to be"
"[11:48] mn015 | pretty key , because"
[11:50] mn015 | having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level
[11:55] mn015 | Um
[11:56] mn015 | and sort of noticing that
[11:58] mn015 | everything that happens here let 's go to our
[12:01] mn015 | favorite endpoint one
[12:03] mn015 | is again
[12:04] mn015 | more or less we have um then the situation
"[12:10] mn015 | nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth ."
"[12:16] mn015 | um I can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it"
"[12:34] mn015 | parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the D and the ontology to the sub - O node ."
[12:41] mn015 | And um
"[12:48] mn015 | t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place ."
[12:55] mn015 | But this makes the design thing fairly simple .
[12:59] mn015 | And um
[13:17] mn015 | OK .
[13:19] mn015 | and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing . You get involved in that process too .
[13:33] mn015 | And for now uh
[13:34] mn015 | the the question
"[13:36] mn015 | is "" How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our"
"[13:43] mn015 | data collection ? """
"[13:53] mn015 | you know we could call the z see or you know , people who visit the zoo we could s call it "" Visit the zoo tomorrow "" , so we have"
"[14:01] mn015 | an intention of seeing something , but not now but later ."
[14:01] me010 | Right .
[14:05] me010 | let 's s uh s
[14:07] me010 | see I th I think that
[14:11] me010 | from
"[14:12] me010 | one point of view ,"
"[14:14] me010 | Uh , um , all these places are the same , so that d d"
"[14:20] me010 | in terms of the linguistics and stuff ,"
"[14:24] me010 | there may be a few different kinds of places , so"
[14:27] me010 | I th i it seems to me that
[14:30] me010 | We ought to decide
"[14:33] me010 | you know , what things are k are actually going to matter to us ."
"[14:36] me010 | And um , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera ."
[14:42] me010 | Um are all big - ish things that
"[14:46] me010 | um you know have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine ."
[14:47] mn015 | Hmm .
[14:56] mn015 | no person is gonna
[14:57] mn015 | do all of them . They 're just gonna select u
"[15:00] mn015 | um , according to their preferences . "" Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit castles , or I usually "" And then you pick that one ."
"[15:00] me010 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[15:06] me010 | Right , no no , but but s th point is"
[15:12] me010 | build a system that 's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing .
[15:15] me010 | T to build a system that um had the most data
"[15:22] me010 | on a relatively confined set of things , you do something else ."
"[15:26] me010 | And the speech people , for example , are gonna do better"
[15:30] me010 | if they if things come up
"[15:34] me010 | uh repeatedly . Now , of course , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting ."
[15:41] me010 | there 's a kind of question of what we 're trying t to accomplish .
[15:49] me010 | I think my temptation for the data gathering would be to
[16:07] me010 | then
[16:11] me010 | my guess is that that the data is going to be easier
[16:16] me010 | to handle . Now of course you have this
[16:18] me010 | I guess possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use
"[16:22] me010 | uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff ,"
[16:31] me010 | but I guess I 'm I uh m my temptation is to go for simpler .
"[16:47] me045 | limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go , right ?"
"[16:51] me045 | But who is it that has to care about this , or what component of the system ?"
"[16:54] me010 | Oh , well , uh th I think there are two places where it comes up . One is"
[16:59] me010 | uh in the th these people who are gonna take this and and try to do speech with it .
[17:05] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[17:06] me010 | uh Lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you
[17:11] me010 | better data
[17:12] me010 | than
"[17:13] me010 | l you know , a few pronunciations of lots more things ."
[17:16] me045 | OK .
[17:17] me010 | That 's one .
[17:18] me045 | So we would rather just
"[17:21] me045 | ask uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo ,"
[17:27] me045 | that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of
"[17:31] me045 | zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places ."
"[17:36] me045 | And that way you get the speech data of people saying "" zoo "" over and over again or whatever too . OK ."
[17:37] me010 | Yeah .
[17:39] me010 | Yeah .
"[17:39] me010 | Yeah . So this is a question for you , and , you know , if we if we do , and we probably will , actually try to uh build a prototype ,"
[17:41] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[17:49] me010 | uh
[17:51] me010 | probably we could get by
[17:54] me010 | with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway .
"[17:57] me010 | So ,"
"[18:00] mn015 | Yeah , the"
[18:02] mn015 | this was sort of these are all different sort of activities .
[18:06] mn015 | Um
"[18:12] mn015 | put them in a more hierarchical fashion . So ,"
"[18:27] mn015 | on that "" go to big - ish place "" , this is what I would do . """
[18:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:30] mn015 | And then we have the "" Fix "" thing , and then maybe "" Do something the other day "" thing , so ."
"[18:40] mn015 | I guess , to some extent , we should y we just have to try it out and see if it works . It would be"
"[18:47] mn015 | challenging , in in a sense , to try to make it so so complex that they even really should"
"[18:53] mn015 | schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex"
"[18:57] mn015 | thing in terms of OK , you know , they should get the feeling that there are"
[19:02] mn015 | these s six things they have to do
[19:04] mn015 | and they sh can be done maybe in two days .
[19:04] me010 | Well yeah .
[19:07] me010 | Well I think th th yeah .
"[19:08] mn015 | So they make these decisions , "" Can I go there tomorrow ? "" or you know influences"
[19:11] me010 | Yeah .
[19:12] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:12] me010 | Well , I think it 's easy enough to set that up if that 's your expectation . So ,"
"[19:17] me010 | the uh system could say , "" Well , uh we 'd like to to set up your program for two days"
"[19:24] me010 | in Heidelberg ,"
"[19:25] me010 | you know , let 's first think about all the things you might like to do ."
"[19:30] me010 | So there th i i in I mean in I th I I 'm sure that if that 's what you did then they would start telling you about that , and then you could get into um various things about ordering , if you wanted ."
[19:38] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[19:40] mn015 | Yeah .
"[19:42] mn015 | Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job . And that can be done , sort of to say , "" OK now we 've picked these six tasks . """
"[19:49] mn015 | "" Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . """
[19:54] mn015 | And th w
"[19:54] me010 | I 'm sorry . No , we have to help we have to decide . Fey will p carry out whatever we decide ."
[19:59] me010 | But we have to decide
"[20:01] me010 | you know , what is the appropriate scenario ."
[20:04] me010 | That 's what we 're gonna talk about t yeah .
"[20:04] mn015 | Yep , yep ."
"[20:10] mn036 | The other , it kind of give you instructions on the spot"
"[20:13] mn015 | Yeah , but th the I don't I 'm not really interested in sort of "" Phase planning "" capabilities . But it 's more the how do people phrase these planning requests ?"
"[20:24] mn015 | So are we gonna masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system ,"
"[20:29] mn015 | "" I have one question I get one response "" , or should"
[20:33] mn015 | we allow for a certain level of complexity . And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal
[20:39] mn015 | references .
"[20:40] me010 | Well , so Keith , what do you think ?"
"[20:44] me045 | Well , um"
"[20:47] me045 | it seems that Yeah , I mean ,"
"[20:51] me045 | off the top of my head it kinda seems like you would probably just want , you know , richer data , more complex stuff going on , people trying to do more complex sets of things . I mean you know , if our goal is to really sort of"
"[21:02] me045 | be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff , then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistic stuff ."
[21:09] me045 | But I mean I 'm I 'm not really sure
"[21:11] me045 | Uh , because I don't"
[21:13] me045 | fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet .
[21:15] mn015 | I mean w we have tested this and a y have you heard listen to the f first two or th as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup .
"[21:25] me045 | I started to listen to one and it was just like , um ,"
"[21:29] me045 | uh ,"
[21:30] me045 | sort of depressing . I thought I 'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something . And .
"[21:36] mn015 | Oh , OK . That was the first subject ."
[21:36] me010 | Yeah .
[21:37] me045 | Yeah .
[21:37] me010 | First one wasn't very good .
[21:38] me045 | Yeah .
[21:38] mn015 | Yeah .
"[21:40] mn015 | Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup"
[21:45] mn015 | and that particular subject
[21:46] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[21:50] mn015 | I suggest we
"[21:51] mn015 | make some fine tuning of these ,"
"[21:54] mn015 | get sort of run through ten or so subjects and then take a breather , and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting ."
[21:57] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[22:02] me045 | Right .
"[22:04] me045 | Yeah . It In fact , um ,"
[22:06] me045 | I am just
"[22:08] me045 | you know today , next couple days gonna start really diving into this data . I 've basically looked at one of the files you know one of these l y y y you gave me those dozens of files and I looked at one of them which was about ten sentences ,"
"[22:29] me045 | Right , I mean ,"
[22:31] me045 | once I start doing that I 'll have more to say about this kind of thing .
[22:33] me010 | OK .
"[22:34] me010 | But well th but you did say something important , which is"
[22:37] me010 | that
[22:39] me010 | um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied
[22:43] me010 | uh with the simple cases for quite a while .
[22:46] me045 | Yeah .
"[22:53] me010 | Uh , now , I have looked at all the data , and it 's pre it 's actually"
"[22:56] me010 | at least to an amateur , quite redundant . That that it was it was very stylized ,"
"[22:59] me045 | Yeah , Yeah ."
[23:01] me010 | and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing .
"[23:04] me045 | I um I did sort of scan it at first and noticed that , and then looked in detail at one of them . But yeah , yeah I noticed that , too ."
[23:06] me010 | Yeah .
"[23:09] me010 | So , we we we wanna do more than that ."
[23:13] mn015 | And with this we 're getting more .
[23:14] me010 | OK .
[23:14] mn015 | No question .
[23:15] me010 | Right .
"[23:22] me010 | I think your suggestion is good , which is"
[23:24] me010 | we 'll do a b uh a batch .
[23:27] me010 | OK .
"[23:28] me010 | And , uh , Fey , How long is it gonna be till you have ten subjects ?"
[23:33] me010 | Couple days ? Or thr f a
[23:34] me010 | A week ? Or I don't I don't have a feel for th
"[23:35] fe046 | Um I can Yeah , I mean I s I think can probably schedule ten people ,"
"[23:42] fe046 | uh ,"
[23:43] fe046 | whenever .
"[23:44] me010 | Well , it 's it 's up to you , I mean I j I uh e We don't have any huge time pressure . It 's just when you have t Yeah ."
[23:48] fe046 | How long will it be ? Um I I would say maybe two weeks .
"[23:52] me010 | Oh , OK ."
"[23:54] me010 | So let 's do this . Let 's plan next Monday ,"
"[23:57] me010 | OK , to have a review of what we have"
[24:01] me010 | so far .
[24:04] me010 | Huh ?
"[24:05] mn015 | no transcriptions of course , yeah ."
"[24:06] me010 | No , we won't have the transcriptions , but what we should"
[24:09] me010 | be able to do
"[24:11] me010 | and I don't know if , Fey , if you will have time to do this , but it would be great if you could , um ,"
"[24:17] me010 | not transcribe it all , but pick out"
"[24:20] me010 | uh , some stuff . I mean we"
[24:23] me010 | could lis uh just sit here and listen to it all .
[24:25] me010 | Are you gonna have the audio on the web site ?
[24:30] me010 | OK .
[24:30] mn015 | Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s
[24:33] mn015 | ki kills me .
[24:34] mn015 | And we 're gonna put it on the web site . Yeah .
"[24:36] me010 | Oh , we could get I mean , you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars , right ? I mean it 's it 's not like OK ."
"[24:42] me010 | So , we 'll take care of David Johnson . OK ."
"[24:45] mn015 | uh , he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful , so s"
[24:48] me010 | OK .
"[24:49] me010 | Alright . So we 'll buy a disk . But anyway , so ,"
"[24:53] me010 | um ,"
[24:58] me010 | to
"[25:00] me010 | uh , point us to th to interesting things , sort of as you 're doing this or or something"
"[25:06] me010 | uh , make your make notes or something that that this is , you know , something worth looking at . And"
"[25:13] me010 | other than that , yeah I guess we 'll just have to"
"[25:18] me010 | uh , listen although I guess it 's only ten minutes each , right ? Roughly ."
"[25:21] fe046 | Well , I guess . I 'm not sure how long it 's actually going to take ."
"[25:23] mn015 | The reading task is a lot shorter . That was cut by fifty percent . And the reading ,"
[25:27] mn015 | nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people .
"[25:29] me010 | Right . No , we don't care about that at all ."
[25:30] mn015 | So .
[25:31] mn015 | It 's actually like five minutes dialogue .
[25:34] me010 | I b My guess is it 's gonna be ten .
[25:38] mn015 | Ten minutes is long .
"[25:42] mn015 | Yeah . It feels like forever when you 're doing it , but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds ."
[25:43] me010 | Yeah .
[25:45] me010 | Yeah .
[25:51] me010 | Whatever . Whatever it is we 'll we 'll deal with it .
[25:55] mn015 | And it 's fun .
[25:57] me010 | um on on the web page .
[25:59] mn015 | OK .
[25:59] me010 | That 's great .
[26:00] me010 | Um
[26:04] me010 | it 's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system .
[26:10] me010 | And then if we want to
[26:12] me010 | uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an
"[26:23] me010 | you know , any of that stuff ."
"[26:27] me010 | You know , "" Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning ? """
[26:31] mn015 | Yeah .
[26:36] me010 | pretty straight forward .
[26:39] mn015 | @ @
[26:43] me010 | OK .
"[26:49] me010 | I 'm sorry , Fey , what ?"
[26:50] fe046 | That w
[26:51] fe046 | maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o
[26:55] fe046 | offer only one member of that category ?
"[26:56] me010 | That 's what I was suggesting for the first round , yeah ."
[26:58] fe046 | OK .
[26:59] me045 | So rather than having zoo and castle .
"[27:03] me010 | They could , but i but i uh tha"
[27:04] fe046 | If you wanted data on different
[27:06] fe046 | constructions .
"[27:17] mn015 | And no , th the per the person don't get it . I mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - A and three tasks for part - B a"
[27:21] me010 | Right .
[27:24] me010 | Yeah .
"[27:25] fe046 | Well no , they could still choose . They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say , touring the castle ."
"[27:30] mn015 | Exactly . This is limiting the choices , but yeah ."
"[27:32] mn015 | Right . OK , sorry . But um I I think this approach will"
"[27:36] mn015 | very well work , but the person was able to look at it and say "" OK , This is what I would actually do . """
[27:40] me010 | OK .
[27:40] mn015 | Yeah . @ @ OK . @ @
"[27:51] fe046 | I mean there they are significantly different , but ."
"[27:55] mn015 | But no , they 're I mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know tourists maybe a bit different and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here ."
"[28:00] fe046 | Yeah , I guess so ."
[28:01] me010 | Yeah .
"[28:08] me010 | Yeah , in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each"
"[28:12] me010 | in common , like at you know , "" attend a theater , symphony or opera "" is is a group , and "" tour the university , castle or zoo "" ,"
[28:18] mn015 | mm - hmm
"[28:18] me010 | all of these d do have this kind of "" tour """
[28:22] me010 | um aspect about the way you would go to them .
[28:22] mn015 | Yeah .
"[28:26] me010 | And uh ,"
[28:29] me010 | the movie theater is probably also
"[28:31] me010 | uh e is a "" attend """
"[28:32] mn015 | Attend , yeah ."
[28:33] me010 | et cetera .
[28:34] me010 | So it may turn out to be
"[28:38] mn015 | Hmm , mm - hmm ."
[28:44] me010 | uh their responses would
[28:46] me010 | tend to be
[28:48] me010 | grouped
"[28:50] me010 | according to the kind of activity , you would expect ."
[28:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:02] me010 | Oh , absolutely . Yeah ."
"[29:04] mn015 | Yeah , this is where yeah th the function stuff is definitely different and the"
"[29:04] mn036 | @ @ function , yeah ."
[29:08] mn015 | getting information or g
"[29:15] mn015 | OK . But this is open . So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy ."
[29:24] mn015 | And
"[29:25] mn015 | for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense ."
[29:28] mn015 | And um
[29:31] mn015 | we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people
"[29:36] mn015 | asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer ."
[29:41] mn015 | And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll
[29:47] mn015 | sneak them into the
[29:50] mn015 | collection .
[29:52] mn015 | We 're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it .
[29:54] me010 | We don't have enough .
[29:55] mn015 | No .
[29:58] mn015 | But it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects and if we can keep it up
[30:08] mn015 | sort of five four - ish per week
"[30:10] mn015 | rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago ."
[30:17] fe046 | That means that one hundred people have to be interested .
[30:21] me045 | Good luck .
[30:22] fe046 | Yeah .
"[30:22] me010 | Well ,"
"[30:24] me010 | um ,"
"[30:25] me010 | these are all f people off campus s from campus so far , right ?"
[30:27] fe046 | Yeah .
[30:28] fe046 | Yeah .
[30:29] me010 | So we yeah we don't know how many we can get next door at the uh shelter for example .
[30:33] me045 | Hmm .
"[30:34] me010 | Uh for ten bucks , probably quite a few ."
[30:36] me045 | Yeah .
[30:37] me045 | That 's right .
[30:38] me010 | Yeah .
"[30:39] me010 | So , alright , so let 's go let 's go back then ,"
[30:41] mn015 | Yep .
"[30:43] me010 | the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see"
[30:51] me010 | um
"[30:52] me010 | cover what we need , or should we be thinking about more ?"
"[30:57] mn015 | Okay , in terms of decision nodes ?"
[30:58] me010 | Yep .
"[30:59] mn015 | I mean , Go - there is is a yes or no ."
[31:02] mn015 | Right ?
[31:02] me010 | Yep .
[31:02] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:03] mn015 | I 'm also interested in th in this "" property "" uh line here , so if you"
"[31:09] mn015 | sorry , look at that"
"[31:11] mn015 | um ,"
[31:12] mn015 | timing was
[31:15] mn015 | um I have these three . Do we need a final differentiation there ?
"[31:19] mn015 | Now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour ."
"[31:25] mn015 | It 's sort of next day , so you 're doing something now"
"[31:29] mn015 | and you have planned to do these three four things , and you can do something immediately ,"
[31:31] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[31:34] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[31:35] mn015 | you could sort of tag it on to that tour
[31:37] me045 | Or OK .
[31:37] mn015 | or you can say this is something I would do s I wanna do sometime l
[31:41] me045 | OK .
"[31:42] mn015 | in my life ,"
[31:43] me045 | OK .
[31:43] mn015 | basically .
[31:43] me045 | So so this tour is sort of just like th the idea of
"[31:47] me045 | current s round of of touristness or whatever , OK ."
[31:48] me010 | Right .
"[31:50] me010 | Yeah . Yeah , probably between stops back at the hotel ."
[31:53] me045 | OK . Got it .
"[31:54] me010 | I mean if you if if you wanted precise about it , uh you know , uh and I think that 's the way tourists do organize their lives ."
[31:56] me045 | Got it .
"[32:00] me045 | Sure , sure , sure ."
"[32:00] me010 | You know , "" OK , we 'll go back to the hotel and then we 'll go off and """
[32:03] me045 | OK .
[32:03] mn036 | So all tours b a tour happens only within one day ?
[32:07] me010 | Yes .
[32:07] me045 | OK .
[32:08] mn036 | So the next tour will be tomorrow ?
[32:09] me010 | Right .
[32:10] me010 | For this .
[32:11] me045 | OK .
[32:12] me045 | Just to be totally clear . OK .
"[32:13] mn015 | Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel , so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think ."
"[32:23] me045 | You just spend the whole time at U Fleku or something , ri"
[32:24] mn036 | Yeah .
[32:27] fe046 | Right . That 's enough .
[32:27] mn036 | Right .
[32:28] mn015 | I don't know . What is the uh the the English co uh um
"[32:33] mn015 | cognate if you want , for "" Sankt Nimmerlandstag "" ?"
"[32:39] mn015 | Sort of "" We 'll do it"
[32:39] me010 | Yeah .
[32:41] mn015 | on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .
[32:43] me010 | Right .
[32:44] mn015 | Do you have an expression ?
[32:46] mn015 | Probably you sh
[32:48] me045 | Not that I know of actually .
"[32:52] mn015 | Yeah , when hell Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over . So maybe that should be another"
[32:53] me010 | Yeah .
[32:56] mn036 | Right .
[32:57] me010 | Yeah .
[32:59] me010 | No .
[33:04] mn015 | OK .
"[33:05] mn015 | Um , the reason why why do we go there in the first place"
"[33:08] mn015 | IE uh it 's either uh for sightseeing , for meeting people , for running errands , or doing business ."
[33:16] fe004 | Is this the theater thing ?
[33:18] fe004 | Like entertainment or something like that ?
"[33:21] mn015 | Entertainment is a good one in there , I think . I agree ."
"[33:26] me045 | So ,"
"[33:27] me045 | business is supposed to uh ,"
"[33:31] me045 | be sort of it like professional type stuff , right , or something like that ?"
[33:34] mn015 | Yep .
[33:34] me045 | OK .
[33:42] me045 | Um .
[33:44] mn015 | I mean this w this is uh
[33:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[33:53] me045 | Yeah .
"[33:55] me010 | Yeah , or or both ."
[33:56] me045 | Yeah .
[33:57] mn015 | Yep .
[34:02] me045 | He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things .
[34:06] me010 | Mmm . Sure . Right .
[34:06] mn015 | Yep . Yep .
[34:10] mn036 | What ab
[34:11] mn036 | What do you have in mind in terms of um socializing ? What kind of activities ?
"[34:15] mn015 | Eh , just meeting people , basically ."
"[34:17] mn015 | "" I want to meet someone somewhere "" , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the "" EVA """
"[34:23] mn015 | you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually , you 're just want to approach it ."
[34:23] me045 | Yeah .
[34:35] me010 | Mm - hmm
[34:35] mn015 | Yep .
"[34:40] mn036 | Socializing , I guess ."
[34:45] me045 | Right .
"[34:48] me010 | I would say that if "" Dine out "" is a special c uh if you 're doing it for that purpose then it 's entertainment ."
[34:54] me045 | Yeah .
"[34:54] me010 | And we 'll also as y as you 'll s further along we 'll get into business about "" Well , you 're you know this is going over a meal time , do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? """
[35:03] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[35:04] me010 | And that 's
[35:06] me010 | different . That 's that 's sort of part of th that 's not a destination
[35:10] me045 | Right .
"[35:10] me010 | reason , that 's sort of "" en passant , "" right ."
[35:13] me045 | Yeah .
"[35:17] mn015 | OK , "" endpoint "" ."
[35:20] me010 | Right .
"[35:20] mn015 | "" Endpoint "" is pretty clear . Um ,"
"[35:25] mn015 | "" mode "" , uh , I have found three , "" drive there "" , "" walk there "" uh or "" be driven "" , which means bus , taxi , BART ."
[35:33] me010 | OK .
"[35:34] fe004 | The public transport in general is "" be driven "" ?"
[35:35] mn015 | Yeah .
[35:37] mn015 | Yep .
"[35:38] me010 | Obviously taxis are very different than buses , but on the other hand the system doesn't have"
[35:40] fe004 | Yeah .
[35:44] me010 | any public transport This the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet .
[35:48] fe004 | OK .
"[35:49] mn015 | So this granularity would suffice , I think w if we say the person probably , based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude"
"[35:57] mn015 | wants to drive there , walk there , or"
[35:59] mn015 | use some other form of transportation .
[36:02] me045 | H How much of Heidelberg can you get around by public transport ? I mean in terms of the interesting bits . There 's lots of bits where you don't really
"[36:09] me045 | I 've only ev was there ten years ago , for a day , so I don't remember , but ."
[36:14] me010 | Mm -
[36:15] mn015 | Everywhere .
[36:21] mn015 | Yeah .
[36:21] me045 | OK .
"[36:22] me010 | but I think other things you can , if I remember right ."
"[36:28] mn015 | Yeah , um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component ."
[36:36] me010 | Oh !
[36:36] mn015 | So .
[36:36] fe046 | Mmm g that 's good .
[36:37] mn015 | Um .
[36:37] me010 | Put it in .
"[36:38] mn015 | Bicycles c should be in there , but ,"
[36:47] me045 | Yeah .
"[36:48] me010 | OK , we can leave it out , I guess ."
[36:49] me045 | Yeah .
"[36:49] mn015 | We can we can sort of uh ,"
"[36:53] me045 | I would I would lump it with "" walk "" because hills matter . Right ? You know . Things like that ."
[36:55] mn015 | Yeah .
[36:58] me010 | OK .
"[36:59] me010 | Skateboards @ @ right , anyway ."
[37:01] mn036 | Right .
[37:03] mn015 | Yep .
[37:05] me010 | Alright .
"[37:06] mn015 | OK , "" Length "" is um ,"
"[37:10] mn015 | you wanna get this over with as fast as possible ,"
[37:14] mn015 | you wanna use some part of what of the time you have .

"[37:19] mn015 | Um , they can . But we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time ."
[37:20] me010 | Ye -
"[37:29] mn015 | You know , they wanna do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh you know the necessary and plus time ."
[37:29] me045 | Hmm .
[37:41] mn015 | And y
"[37:48] mn015 | to the planner , that they probably want to use all the time they have ."
"[37:52] mn015 | So , stretch out that visit for"
[37:54] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[37:55] me045 | Wow It seems like this would be really hard to guess .
[37:55] mn015 | that .
[38:00] me045 | I mean you 're you 're talking about rather than having the user decide this you 're supposed t we 're supposed to figure it out ?
[38:04] me010 | w
"[38:05] mn015 | Th - the user can always s say it , but it 's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important ."
[38:05] me010 | well
[38:06] me045 | Overrider @ @
[38:07] me010 | Yeah .
[38:13] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:13] mn015 | And that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask ."
"[38:19] me010 | And par yeah , and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out , then you ask ."
[38:19] me045 | OK .
[38:20] mn015 | Yeah .
[38:24] me045 | OK .
[38:25] me010 | But hopefully you don't ask
[38:28] me045 | Yeah . Yeah . Right . Yeah .
"[38:29] me010 | eh so , y but there 's th but definitely a back - off position to asking ."
"[38:33] mn015 | And if no no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important ,"
[38:38] mn015 | no planner is ever gonna ask for it .
[38:40] me045 | Yeah .
"[38:41] mn015 | y so And I like the idea that , you know , sort of Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t"
[38:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:54] mn015 | If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ?"
"[38:59] mn015 | And ,"
"[38:59] mn015 | Timing , uh ,"
"[39:01] mn015 | uh , Length would definitely be part of it ,"
"[39:04] mn015 | "" Costs "" ,"
"[39:06] mn015 | "" Little money , some money , lots of money "" ?"
[39:07] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:12] mn015 | uh so , F Yeah , OK ."
[39:15] fe004 | Some @ @ .
[39:16] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[39:18] me045 | You could say "" some "" in there ."
[39:21] mn036 | I must say that thi
[39:22] mn036 | this one looks a bit strange to me . Um maybe It seems like appropriate
[39:26] mn036 | if I go to Las Vegas .
[39:28] mn036 | Well but I decide k kind of how much money
[39:31] mn036 | uh I 'm willing to lose .
"[39:32] mn036 | But a I as a tourist , I 'll just paying what 's what 's more or less is required ."
"[39:36] me010 | Well , no . I think there are there 're different things where you have a ch choice , for example ,"
[39:39] me045 | Yeah .
"[39:40] me010 | uh this t interacts with "" do am I do oh are you willing to take a taxi ? """
[39:40] me045 | Dinner .
[39:41] fe004 | Restaurant .

"[39:51] me010 | the best seats or the peanut gallery or , you know , whatever ?"
[39:54] mn036 | Right .
[39:55] me010 | S so I think there are a variety of things in which
"[40:01] me010 | Tour - tourists really do have different styles eating . Another one , you know ."
[40:05] me045 | Yeah .
"[40:05] mn036 | Right , that 's true ."
[40:05] fe046 | Right .
"[40:11] mn015 | Well , I I once had to write a a a a charter , a carter for a a student organization . And they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be ."
"[40:25] mn015 | And I wrote in there "" En - Enough """
[40:29] mn015 | people have to be there .
"[40:30] mn015 | And it was hotly debated , but"
"[40:32] mn015 | people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people . And if you go to Turkey , you will find"
[40:38] me045 | Yeah .
"[40:41] mn015 | when people go shopping , they will say "" How much cheese do you want ? "" and they say "" Ah , enough . """
[40:45] mn015 | And the and the this used all over the place .
"[40:48] mn015 | Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough ."
[40:50] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:55] mn015 | And um so the middle part is always sort of the the golden way , right ? So you can s you can be really make it as cheap as possible , or you can say "" I want , er , you know , I don't care """
[41:06] me045 | Money is no object . Mm - hmm .
[41:07] me010 | Yeah .
"[41:07] mn015 | Money is no object , or you say "" I just want to spend enough "" ."
[41:11] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:11] mn015 | Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount ."
[41:14] me045 | Yeah .
"[41:16] mn015 | But ,"
"[41:17] mn015 | Then again , this may turn out to be"
"[41:19] mn015 | insufficient for our purposes . But well ,"
"[41:22] mn015 | this is my first guess , in much the same way as how how d"
[41:23] me045 | I mean y
[41:24] me045 | Yeah .
"[41:27] mn015 | you know should the route be ? Should it be the easiest route , even if it 's a b little bit longer ?"
[41:32] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:32] mn015 | No steep inclinations ? Go the normal way ? Whatever that again means , er or do you does the person wanna rough it ?"
[41:37] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:42] me045 | I mean th so there 's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things right ? You know "" I want to go there and I don't care if it 's really hard . """
[41:53] me010 | Right .
[41:56] fe046 | Right .
"[42:02] me010 | No , I think he was going for the second one ar actually ."
[42:04] me045 | Yeah ?
"[42:05] me010 | Anyway , we 'll sort th yeah , we 'll sort that out ."
[42:05] me045 | I I OK .
[42:08] me010 | Right .
[42:09] me010 | Absolutely .
"[42:14] mn015 | Well , this is all sort of"
"[42:16] mn015 | um , top of my head . No no research behind that ."
[42:18] me045 | Yeah .
"[42:21] mn015 | Um "" Object information "" , "" Do I do I wanna know anything about that object ? "" is either true or false ."
[42:26] mn015 | And .
"[42:28] mn015 | if I care about it being open , accessible or not ,"
[42:31] mn015 | I don't think there 's any middle ground there .
"[42:35] mn015 | Um ,"
"[42:36] mn015 | either I wanna know where it is or not ,"
"[42:38] mn015 | I wanna know about it 's history or not ,"
"[42:40] mn015 | or ,"
[42:42] mn015 | um I wanna know about
[42:43] mn015 | what it 's good for or not .
"[42:47] mn015 | Maybe one could put scales in there , too . So I wanna know a l"
"[42:49] me010 | Yeah , now ob"
"[42:51] me010 | OK , I 'm sorry , go ahead , what were you gonna say ?"
[42:51] mn015 | lot about it .
"[42:53] mn015 | One could put scales in there . So I wanna know a lot about the history , just a bit ."
"[42:56] me010 | Yeah , right well y i w if we w right ."
"[42:59] me010 | So "" object "" becomes "" entity "" , right ?"
"[43:01] mn015 | Yep , that 's true ."
"[43:02] me010 | Yeah , but we don't have to do it now ."
[43:04] mn015 | Yep .
[43:08] mn015 | That was the wrong shortcut anyhow .
"[43:15] me010 | And we think that 's it , interestingly enough , that"
"[43:18] me010 | um ,"
[43:33] me010 | going to be enough .
[43:46] fe046 | Still wrong .
[44:01] me010 | So I think the order of things is that
"[44:04] me010 | um ,"
"[44:06] me010 | Robert will clean this up a little bit , although it looks pretty good ."
"[44:10] mn015 | What , well this is the part that this is the part that needs the work ."
[44:11] me010 | Huh ?
"[44:13] me010 | Right . Yeah , so right , so So ,"
[44:13] me045 | Yeah .
[44:16] me010 | um
"[44:18] me010 | In parallel ,"
[44:20] me010 | uh three things are going to happen .
"[44:26] me010 | build a belief - net that that , um , has CPT 's and , you know , tries to infer this from various kinds of information ."
"[44:35] me010 | And Fey is going to start collecting data ,"
[44:40] me010 | and we 're gonna start thinking a about uh what constructions we want to elicit .
[44:47] me010 | And then w go it may iterate on
[44:53] me045 | Do you mean eliciting particular constructions ? Or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about ?
"[44:59] me010 | Well , yes ."
"[44:59] me045 | Semantically speaking , eh ?"
[45:00] me010 | Both .
[45:00] me045 | OK .
"[45:04] me010 | Though for us , constructions are primarily semantic , right ?"
[45:07] me045 | Right .
[45:09] me045 | Sure .
[45:17] me045 | OK .
"[45:18] me010 | You know if th if we in if we you know , make sure that we get them talking about temporal order ."
[45:25] me045 | Yeah .
[45:28] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[45:30] me045 | Right . OK .
"[45:33] me010 | W You know , whatever form they use"
[45:36] me010 | is fine .
[45:36] me045 | OK .
[45:37] me010 | But I I think that probably we 're gonna try to look at it as
"[45:42] me010 | you know , s what semantic constructions d do we do we want them to uh do direc you know , um ,"
[45:44] me045 | OK .
"[45:48] me010 | "" Caused motion "" , I don't know , something like that ."
[45:50] me045 | OK .
[45:52] me010 | Uh
[45:52] me045 | Got it .
"[45:53] me010 | But ,"
[45:54] me010 | Eh - uh this is actually a conversation you and I have to have about
[45:57] me045 | Yeah .
"[45:58] me010 | your thesis fantasies , and how all this fits into that ."
[46:01] me045 | Uh Yeah . OK .
"[46:04] mn015 | Well , I will tell you the German tourist data ."
[46:07] me045 | OK .
[46:07] mn015 | Because I have not
[46:09] mn015 | been able to dig out all the stuff out of the
[46:11] mn015 | m ta thirty D V Ds .
[46:14] me045 | OK .
"[46:19] mn015 | No , not at all . Dialogues ."
[46:20] me045 | OK .
[46:21] me045 | OK .
[46:23] mn015 | Human . Wizard of Oz .
"[46:25] me045 | OK . Same OK , that . Got it ."
[46:37] mn015 | With nothing .
"[46:38] me010 | No , no ."
[46:38] me045 | Just talking into a box and not hearing anything back . OK .
[46:40] mn015 | Yep .
[46:41] mn015 | Yep .
[46:43] mn015 | Some data I collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when .
[46:47] me045 | OK .
[46:49] me045 | OK .
[46:50] mn015 | Nothing to write home about .
[46:52] me045 | OK .
[46:55] mn015 | the see this this this uh ontology node is probably something that I will
"[47:01] mn015 | try to expand . Once we have the full ontology API ,"
[47:05] mn015 | what can we expect to get from the ontology ?
[47:08] mn015 | And hopefully you can sort of also
"[47:11] mn015 | try to find out , you know , sooner or later"
"[47:13] mn015 | in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might , you know or the not the discourse , the utterance"
[47:16] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:18] me010 | mm - hmm .
[47:19] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:20] me010 | Right .
"[47:24] me010 | Right , but we 're not expecting Keith to actually build a parser ."
"[47:27] me045 | Right , Right ."
[47:28] me010 | OK .
[47:31] mn015 | Yes .
"[47:31] me045 | By the end of the summer , too ."
[47:32] me010 | No .
[47:33] mn015 | No .
[47:34] me010 | No .
[47:37] me010 | He 's g he 's hoping to do this for his masters ' thesis s by a year from now .
[47:39] me045 | Right .
[47:41] me045 | Hmm .
[47:43] me010 | Eh - absolutely .
"[47:45] me010 | Uh limited . I mean , you know , the idea is is , Well , the hope is that the parser itself is , uh , pretty robust ."
[47:47] me045 | Yeah .
"[47:56] me045 | Right , Right . Existence proof , you know . Set up the"
[47:57] me010 | Right .
[47:58] me010 | It 's only popula
"[47:58] me045 | infrastructure , yeah ."
[47:59] me010 | Right .
"[48:01] me045 | Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um"
"[48:07] me045 | what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . I mean , you know obviously like just"
"[48:14] me045 | sort of as general as argument structure constructions . Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . I have to do uh uh unbounded dependencies , you know , which have a variety of constructions in uh uh instantiate that ."
"[48:27] me045 | On the other hand I have to have , you know , there 's particular"
"[48:31] me045 | uh ,"
"[48:32] me045 | fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like "" Get "" plus path expression for , you know , "" how d ho how do I get there ? "" , "" How do I get in ? "" , "" How do I get away ? "" and all that kind of stuff ."
[48:37] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[48:40] me010 | Right .
"[48:42] me045 | Um , so there 's a variety of sort of different"
[48:44] me010 | Absolutely .
"[48:48] me010 | OK , so this is I think we 're gonna mainly work on with George ."
"[48:52] me010 | OK , and hi let me f"
[48:52] me045 | OK .
[48:54] me010 | th say what I think is is so the idea is uh first of all
[48:59] me010 | I misspoke when I said
[49:01] me010 | we thought you should do the constructions . Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly .
"[49:06] me010 | So what I yeah , OK , So what what I meant was "" Do a first cut at "" ."
"[49:11] me045 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[49:12] me010 | OK , Because uh we do wanna get them r u"
[49:14] me010 | perfectly but I think we 're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .
[49:18] me045 | Of course .
"[49:19] me045 | Right , exactly ."
"[49:20] me045 | Now it w we talked about this before , right . And I I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like ,"
"[49:25] me045 | oh I don't know , ten , over the summer , but uh , but you know obviously we need to get"
[49:26] me010 | Yeah .
"[49:30] me045 | sort of a general view of what things look like , so yeah ."
[49:32] me010 | Right . So the idea is going to be
"[49:36] me010 | to do sort of like Nancy did in some of the er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom so you can do f you know ,"
[49:45] me010 | f f uh have a complete story ov of s of some piece of dialogue .
[49:51] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[49:52] me010 | And that 's gonna be much more useful
"[49:56] me010 | than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or or or something like that . So that the the trick is going to be"
[49:59] me045 | Yeah . Sure .
[50:01] me045 | Yeah .
[50:03] me010 | t to take this and pick a some sort of lattice
[50:09] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:09] me010 | of constructions , so some lexical and some phrasal , and and , you know , whatever you need in order to"
[50:12] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:16] me010 | uh , be able to then ,"
"[50:19] me010 | uh , by hand ,"
"[50:21] me010 | you know , explain ,"
[50:21] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[50:22] me045 | Yeah .
[50:22] me010 | some fraction of the utterances .
"[50:24] me010 | And so , exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things ."
[50:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[50:30] me045 | Sure .
[50:31] me045 | OK . But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of
"[50:33] me045 | uh of analysis , you know ,"
"[50:35] me045 | these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the "" Out of "" construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something ."
[50:39] me010 | Correct .
[50:41] me010 | Oh yeah yeah . V a half a page is is what we 'd like .
[50:43] me045 | Yeah .
[50:48] me045 | Yeah .
"[50:50] me045 | For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah ."
[50:52] me010 | Yeah .
"[50:55] mn015 | the ideal speaker utterances , and I mean"
[50:59] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[51:00] mn015 | two
"[51:02] mn015 | or three that follow each other , so ,"
"[51:06] mn015 | where we can also sort of , once we have everything up and running ,"
"[51:10] mn015 | show the tremendous , insane inferencing capabilities of our system ."
"[51:15] mn015 | So , you know , as as the SmartKom people have . This is sort of their standard"
"[51:18] mn015 | demo dialogue , which is , you know , what the system survives and nothing but"
[51:20] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:23] mn015 | that . Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of"
[51:24] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:27] mn015 | o our sample sentences , the ideal sentences where we have complete"
[51:32] mn015 | construction coverage
[51:34] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:34] mn015 | and , sort of ,"
"[51:37] mn015 | the "" How do I get to X ? "" , you know , that 's definitely gonna be"
[51:39] me045 | Yeah .
"[51:41] mn015 | uh , a major one ."
"[51:42] me045 | Yeah . That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , yeah ."
[51:45] me010 | Right .
[51:45] mn015 | Yep .
"[51:46] mn015 | "" Where is X ? "" might be another one which is not too complicated ."
[51:48] me045 | Yeah .
[51:50] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:51] mn015 | And um "" Tell me something about X . """
[51:53] me045 | Yeah .
"[51:54] mn015 | And hey , that 's that 's already covering"
[51:57] mn015 | eighty percent of the system 's functionality .
[51:57] me010 | Ye -
"[51:59] me010 | Right , but it 's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest ."
"[52:05] me010 | No , no , no . Well the th the thing is there 's a lot that needs to be done"
"[52:11] me010 | OK , I th"
[52:11] mn015 | OK .
[52:13] me010 | We done ?
"[52:14] mn015 | I have one bit of news . Um ,"
[52:15] me010 | Good .
[52:16] me010 | Good .
[52:23] mn015 | a p
[52:24] mn015 | lengthy proposal on how he wants to do the action planning .
"[52:29] mn015 | And I responded to him , also rather lengthy , how he should do the action planning ."
"[52:35] me010 | "" Action planning "" meaning "" Discourse Modeling "" ?"
[52:36] mn015 | Yes . And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that
[52:38] me010 | Right .
"[52:41] mn015 | module a dis disc dialogue manager , and"
[52:43] me010 | Right .
[52:44] mn015 | wouldn't it make sense to do this here too ?
"[52:47] mn015 | And also Rainer M Malaka is going to be visiting us shortly , most likely in the beginning of June ."
"[52:54] me010 | Uh - huh , I 'll be gone ."
[52:55] mn015 | Yeah . He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town .
"[52:57] me010 | Sure , OK ."
"[53:00] mn015 | m making me incapable of going to NAACL ,"
[53:05] mn015 | for which I had funding .
[53:08] mn015 | But .
"[53:10] mn015 | No , no Pittsburg this year ."
[53:13] me045 | Hmm .
[53:14] me010 | S
[53:14] mn015 | When is the uh Santa Barbara ? Who is going to ? uh should a lot of people .
[53:23] mn015 | That 's something I will would sort of enjoy .
[53:25] me010 | Probably should go .
[53:26] me010 | That was that 's one you should probably go to .
[53:27] mn015 | Yep .
[53:29] mn015 | There 's
"[53:32] me010 | Uh ,"
[53:34] me010 | probably we can uh pay for it .
[53:37] me045 | OK .
[53:38] me010 | Um a student rate shouldn't be very high .
"[53:43] me010 | So , if we all decide it 's a good idea for you to go then you 'll we 'll pay for it ."
"[53:47] me010 | I mean I I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment , but it probably is ."
[53:49] me045 | OK .
"[53:52] me010 | OK , great ."
[53:53] me045 | Thanks .

[00:00] mn049 | Is it starting now ?
[00:01] me018 | Yep .
"[00:01] mn049 | So what what from what Whatever we say from now on ,"
[00:03] me006 | Hello ?
"[00:05] mn049 | it can be held against us , right ?"
[00:06] me018 | That 's right .
[00:10] me006 | It 's your right to remain silent .
"[00:11] mn049 | Yeah . So I I the the problem is that I actually don't know how th these held meetings are held , if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what 's going on and OK ."
[00:19] me018 | Yeah .
[00:23] mn049 | Yeah .
"[00:24] mn049 | OK . So I guess that what may be a reasonable is if I uh first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective ."
[00:32] me018 | Yeah .
[00:33] me018 | That would be great .
[00:34] fn002 | Uh o
"[00:34] mn049 | and uh so , I I think that Carmen and Stephane reported on uh Amsterdam meeting , which was kind of interesting because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really , but we are competitors ."
[00:50] me018 | Yeah .
"[00:50] me018 | It seemed like there were still some issues , right ? that they were trying to decide ?"
[00:52] mn049 | Yeah .
[00:53] mn049 | There is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues .
"[00:56] mn049 | Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us"
[01:02] mn049 | both had uh voice activity detector .
[01:04] me018 | Right .
"[01:05] mn049 | And I said "" well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up "" . Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either ,"
[01:15] me018 | Right .
"[01:17] mn049 | mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months because that 's buying us the most uh thing . And everybody said "" Well but this is not fair . We didn't know that . """
[01:29] me018 | Right .
"[01:37] mn049 | or at least that if we could modify the recognizer ,"
"[01:40] mn049 | uh to account for these long silences , because otherwise uh that that th that wasn't a correct thing . """
"[01:47] mn049 | And so then ev ev everybody else says "" well we should we need to do a new eval evaluation"
"[01:53] mn049 | without voice activity detector , or we have to do something about it "" . And in principle I uh I we agreed ."
[01:54] me018 | Right .
[01:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:59] mn049 | We said uh "" yeah "" ."
"[02:00] mn049 | Because uh but in that case ,"
"[02:03] mn049 | uh we would like to change the uh the algorithm because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks ."
[02:11] me018 | Right .
"[02:12] mn049 | But unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done , because French Telecom was saying "" no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code ,"
"[02:21] mn049 | so everybody is going to copy what we did . """
"[02:25] mn049 | Yeah well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code . We never"
"[02:32] mn049 | uh uh denied that . We thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent"
[02:36] me018 | Yeah .
"[02:39] mn049 | then you negotiate , or something , right ? I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy ."
[02:40] me018 | Right .
[02:41] me018 | Right .
[02:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:44] mn049 | But And French Telecom was saying "" no , no , no , there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh cannot be protected and you guys will take them , """
"[02:53] mn049 | which probably is also true . I mean , you know ,"
[02:56] mn049 | it might be that people will take uh
[03:06] me018 | Yeah .
[03:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[03:19] me018 | Right .
[03:20] me018 | Right .
"[03:20] mn049 | "" so let 's deal with that "" . So I don't see the problem . The biggest problem of course is that f that Alcatel French Telecom cl claims "" well we fulfilled"
"[03:29] mn049 | the conditions . We are the best . Uh . We are the standard . """
"[03:33] mn049 | And e and other people don't feel that , because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data ,"
"[03:42] mn049 | essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech , because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided ."
[03:45] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[03:52] me018 | Ah .
"[03:57] mn049 | if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms , but I assume so . Because uh we would fight for that , really ."
[04:03] mn049 | uh but since uh u u n u at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum
[04:10] mn049 | gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car
[04:16] me018 | Hmm .
[04:20] mn049 | uh the baseline will go up . And nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement .
[04:22] me018 | Right .
"[04:34] me018 | But wait a minute , I thought the endpointing really only helped in the noisy cases ."
"[04:40] me018 | Oh , but you still have that with the MFCC . OK . Yeah ."
[04:42] mn049 | Y yeah . Yeah but you have the same prob I mean MFCC basically has an enormous number of uh insertions .
[04:43] me018 | Right .
[04:44] me018 | Yeah .
[04:46] me018 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[04:47] mn049 | And so , so now they want to say "" we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . """
[04:57] me018 | Hmm .
"[04:58] mn049 | And uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed . And so last time uh during the meeting ,"
"[05:05] mn049 | I just uh brought up the issue , I said "" well you know uh quite frankly I 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions because"
[05:14] mn049 | this is a major decision . For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement
"[05:19] mn049 | and suddenly you are saying "" oh no we we will do something less "" , but maybe we should discuss that . And everybody said "" oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there "" and I said "" well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these"
"[05:30] mn049 | teleconferencing c things . "" Then they said "" oh no no no because uh everybody is invited . """
"[05:36] mn049 | However , there is only ten or fifteen lines , so people can't even con you know participate ."
"[05:41] mn049 | So eh they agreed , and so they said "" OK , we will discuss that . """
"[05:44] mn049 | Immediately Nokia uh raised the question and they said "" oh yeah we agree this is not good to"
"[05:50] mn049 | to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . "" So now officially , Nokia is uh uh complaining and said they they are looking for support ,"
[05:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:02] mn049 | uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too "" we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet . We should at least try once again , one more round . """
[06:10] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[06:11] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[06:11] mn049 | So this is where we are . I hope that I hope that this is going to be a adopted . Next Wednesday we are going to have uh
[06:13] me018 | Hmm .
"[06:18] mn049 | another uh teleconferencing call , so we 'll see what uh where it goes ."
"[06:23] me018 | So what about the issue of um the weights on the for the different systems , the"
"[06:29] mn049 | Yeah , that 's what that 's a g very good uh point , because David says "" well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . "" So while you are right but uh you know but"
[06:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:41] mn049 | Uh yeah , if of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done ."
[06:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[06:49] mn049 | But weights were also deter already decided uh half a year ago .
[06:53] me018 | And they 're the staying the same ?
"[06:55] mn049 | Well , of course people will not like it ."
[06:57] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[06:57] mn049 | Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution .
[07:04] mn049 | They have solution . Now they
[07:06] me018 | Right .
[07:08] mn049 | And I think that this is not the right way .
[07:09] me018 | Yeah .
[07:10] mn049 | Uh it may be that that Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen .
[07:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[07:16] mn049 | But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .
[07:20] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:21] mn049 | And I don't think we did . Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data"
[07:28] mn049 | and uh essentially there were these arbitrary
"[07:33] mn049 | decisions made , and and everything . So ,"
[07:38] mn049 | so so this is so this is where it is .
[07:40] mn049 | So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh
[07:45] mn049 | uh
"[07:46] mn049 | working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected ,"
[07:52] mn049 | like noise separation .
"[07:54] mn049 | Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically ,"
"[08:05] mn049 | which would be a l uh , f"
"[08:07] mn049 | more robust to noise , and so far not much uh success ."
[08:10] me018 | Hmm .
[08:10] mn049 | We tried uh
"[08:12] mn049 | things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested , instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model ."
"[08:22] mn049 | Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise ."
"[08:30] mn049 | And I thought "" well , that makes sense , "" but so far we can't get much much out of it ."
[08:33] me018 | Hmm .
[08:40] me018 | You haven't tried that yet ?
[08:41] mn049 | not not not much . Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad - hoc techniques like for instance uh
[08:43] me018 | Hmm .
[08:50] mn049 | Dennis Klatt was suggesting
[08:52] mn049 | uh the one way to uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything .
[08:58] me018 | Hmm !
"[08:59] mn049 | So . I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise"
[09:02] me018 | Oh !
[09:02] mn049 | to all data .
[09:04] me018 | I see .
[09:04] mn049 | So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a
[09:09] me018 | Right .
"[09:13] mn049 | And it was working at the time . It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious ."
"[09:19] mn049 | So well , you know , just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant , C , to every every value ."
[09:20] me018 | Well you 're you 're basically y
[09:26] me018 | Yeah . So you 're making all your training data more uniform .
"[09:29] mn049 | Exactly . And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically ."
[09:37] me018 | Hmm .
"[09:38] mn049 | But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down , but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much , it 's a very simple technique ."
[09:47] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:48] mn049 | Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique , you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT , add constant ,"
[09:56] me018 | Hmm .
[09:56] mn049 | you know ? on onto power spectrum .
"[10:01] mn049 | Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave start leaving out"
[10:07] mn049 | the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy
[10:24] mn049 | the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero . That 's what we want to try .
[10:32] mn049 | I have a visitor from Brno . He 's a kind of like young faculty .
[10:38] mn049 | pretty hard - working so he so he 's so he 's looking into that .
[10:41] me018 | Hmm .
[10:43] mn049 | And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .
[10:51] mn049 | This uh this is this recognition from temporal patterns .
[10:54] me018 | Hmm ! What is that ?
[10:56] me006 | Hmm .
"[10:59] mn049 | Yeah I mean tha This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name , but , what it is , is that"
[11:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[11:06] mn049 | normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .
[11:11] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:11] mn049 | Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice ."
"[11:18] mn049 | Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis and you keep shifting this thing ,"
[11:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[11:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:28] mn049 | and you have a spectrogram . So you can say "" well you can also take the time trajectory"
"[11:32] mn049 | of the energy at a given frequency "" ,"
[11:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:34] mn049 | and what you get is then , that you get a p vector ."
[11:39] mn049 | And this vector can be a a s assigned to s some phoneme . Namely you can say
[11:46] mn049 | i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector .
[11:53] mn049 | And you can try to classify based on that .
[11:55] me018 | Hmm .
"[11:56] mn049 | And you so you classi so it 's a very different vector , very different properties , we don't know much about it ,"
[12:02] me018 | Hmm .
"[12:03] me018 | But you have many of those vectors per phoneme , right ?"
"[12:05] mn049 | Well , so you get many decisions ."
[12:07] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[12:07] mn049 | And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions . Exactly , that 's what yeah , that 's what it is ."
[12:11] me018 | Hmm .
[12:13] me018 | Hmm .
[12:20] me018 | Hmm .
[12:25] mn049 | uh so it 's much better than chance .
[12:28] me018 | How wide are the uh frequency bands ?
[12:30] mn049 | That 's another thing . Well c currently we start I mean we start always with critical band spectrum .
[12:35] mn049 | For various reasons . But uh the latest uh observation
[12:39] mn049 | uh is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time .
"[12:47] me006 | Are they adjacent , or are they s OK ."
"[12:49] mn049 | Adjacent , adjacent . And the reasons there are some reasons for that . Because there are some reasons I can I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments"
"[12:59] mn049 | which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands , and also experiments with release of masking ,"
"[13:06] mn049 | which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands ."
[13:12] me018 | Well how do you how do you uh convert
[13:16] me018 | this uh energy over time in a particular frequency band into a vector of numbers ?
"[13:21] mn049 | It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number ,"
"[13:28] mn049 | It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy , yeah ."
[13:29] me018 | it 's just the amount of energy in that band from f in that time interval .
"[13:31] mn049 | Yes , yes ."
"[13:33] mn049 | Yes , yes ."
[13:34] me018 | OK .
"[13:35] mn049 | And that 's what that 's what I 'm saying then , so this is a this is a starting vector ."
"[13:39] mn049 | It 's just like shortened f spectrum , or something . But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents , for instance a question is like "" how correlated are the elements of this vector ? """
[13:43] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:52] mn049 | Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones , right ? They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract ."
[13:56] me018 | Yeah . Yeah .
[14:00] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:00] mn049 | So there 's a very high correlation . So the
[14:04] mn049 | classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it . So we 're thinking about de - correlating them .
[14:08] me018 | Hmm .
"[14:11] mn049 | Then the question is uh "" can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions "" , or to what extent ?"
"[14:21] mn049 | And and and so on and so on . So we are learning quite a lot about that . And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using , I mean the so the minimum is one ."
[14:25] me018 | Hmm .
[14:29] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:32] mn049 | But I mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ?
"[14:36] mn049 | So we somehow made arbitrary decision , "" yes "" ."
[14:44] mn049 | uh
[14:45] mn049 | how to use at least the neighboring band because that seems to be happening This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition .
"[14:53] mn049 | Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands ,"
[15:00] mn049 | but
[15:01] mn049 | then oh uh uh so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal
[15:07] mn049 | in uh uh independently in individual critical bands . That 's what masking experiments tell you . But at the same time
[15:24] mn049 | to to to the to the neighboring bands .
[15:26] mn049 | And that 's how you make uh decisions .
"[15:29] mn049 | That 's why the articulatory events , which uh F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands . You need at least two , basically . You need some relative , relative relation ."
[15:40] me006 | Hmm .
[15:41] me018 | Hmm .
"[15:41] mn049 | Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing . You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening"
"[15:55] mn049 | and maybe at eleven hundred hertz , but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz ."
[16:00] me018 | So it 's really w It 's sort of like saying that what 's happening at one kilohertz depends on what 's happening around it . It 's sort of relative to it .
"[16:08] mn049 | To some extent , it that is also true . Yeah . But it 's but for but for instance ,"
[16:10] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:14] mn049 | uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands ,"
[16:25] mn049 | recognition can discard it .
[16:27] me018 | Hmm .
"[16:29] mn049 | OK , we need us another another voice here ."
[16:30] me018 | Hey Stephane .
"[16:33] mn049 | Yeah , I think so ."
[16:34] me018 | Yep . Sure . Go ahead .
[16:34] mn049 | Yeah ?
[16:35] mn049 | And
[16:37] mn049 | so
[16:39] mn049 | so so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks masks the uh the the signal
[16:48] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:48] mn049 | right ? and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect"
"[16:55] mn049 | the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band . Unless this noise is modulated . If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency"
[16:58] me018 | Hmm .
"[17:05] mn049 | as the noise in a critical band ,"
[17:07] mn049 | the amount of masking is less .
[17:09] me018 | Mmm .
[17:11] mn049 | moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .
"[17:20] mn049 | you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing . And when you e hit a certain point ,"
"[17:29] mn049 | which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same ."
[17:32] me018 | Mmm .
"[17:33] mn049 | So that 's the famous experiment of Fletcher , a long time ago ."
"[17:37] mn049 | Like that 's where people started thinking "" wow this is interesting ! """
[17:40] me018 | Yeah .
"[17:40] mn049 | So . But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down ."
[17:56] mn049 | that cognition can take uh
[17:59] mn049 | uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands .
[18:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:12] mn049 | uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is ,"
[18:16] me018 | Yeah .
[18:17] mn049 | then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much .
[18:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[18:22] mn049 | So .
[18:22] me006 | Hmm .
[18:23] mn049 | So things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope
[18:30] mn049 | that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a in a real recognizer .
[18:35] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[18:35] mn049 | Like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the the the Aurora
[18:41] mn049 | uh program .
[18:42] me018 | But you probably won't have anything before the next
"[18:45] me018 | time we have to evaluate , right ? Yeah ."
"[18:46] mn049 | Probably not . Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules ."
[18:51] me018 | Ah .
[18:52] mn049 | like
[18:53] mn049 | because uh uh
[18:54] me018 | Latency and things .
[18:54] mn049 | latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency
"[19:00] mn049 | amount of processing , because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers ,"
[19:06] mn049 | uh and uh and uh TRAPS . Though the the work which uh everybody is looking at now aims
[19:08] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[19:10] mn007 | Hmm .
[19:13] mn049 | at
[19:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:22] mn049 | or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh that , and how to Gaussian - ize the"
[19:28] me018 | Hmm .
[19:30] mn049 | So this is uh what 's happening . Then Sunil is uh uh uh
[19:34] mn049 | asked me f for one month 's vacation
"[19:37] mn049 | and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no I didn't have heart to tell him no ."
[19:43] mn049 | So he 's in India .
[19:45] me018 | Wow .
[19:46] me018 | Is he getting married or something ?
"[19:47] mn049 | Uh well , he may be looking for a girl , for for I don't I don't I don't ask ."
"[19:58] me018 | Right . Well , I mean , I 've known other friends who they they go to Ind - they go back home to India for a month , they come back married ,"
[20:00] mn049 | Yeah .
[20:00] mn049 | I know .
"[20:04] mn049 | I know , I know , and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife ."
"[20:04] me018 | you know , huh ."
"[20:17] me018 | So he finally had some incentive to finish , huh ?"
[20:18] mn049 | Oh yeah . We had well I had a incentive because he he always had this plan except he never told me .
[20:23] me018 | Oh .
[20:24] mn049 | That was a uh that he uh
[20:26] mn049 | he told me the day when
"[20:28] mn049 | we did very well at our NIST evaluations of speaker recognition , the technology , and he was involved there ."
"[20:39] me018 | When he knew you were happy , huh ?"
[20:51] mn049 | though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first .
[20:55] me018 | Hmm .
[20:55] mn049 | Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier .
[20:58] me018 | Hmm .
"[20:59] mn049 | And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's he already has uh four years served ,"
[21:05] mn049 | though one year he was getting masters . So .
[21:08] mn049 | So .
[21:08] mn007 | Hmm .
[21:09] me018 | So have the um when is the next uh evaluation ? June or something ?
[21:13] mn049 | Which ? Speaker recognition ?
"[21:15] me018 | No , for uh Aurora ?"
"[21:16] mn049 | Uh there , we don't know about evaluation , next meeting is in June . And uh uh but like getting get together ."
[21:20] me018 | Hmm .
"[21:22] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[21:27] mn049 | Nobody said that yet . I assume so .
[21:30] me018 | Hmm .
"[21:30] mn049 | Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the"
[21:36] me018 | Wow .
"[21:39] mn049 | But I uh , yeah , what I think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say "" well you know"
[21:47] mn049 | we did get
[21:48] mn049 | fifty percent improvement .
"[21:51] mn049 | If if you are interested we eventually can tell you how "" ,"
[21:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:53] mn049 | but uh we can get fifty percent improvement . Because people will s will be saying it 's impossible .
[22:00] me018 | Hmm .
[22:04] mn049 | Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline .
[22:08] me018 | Using your uh voice activity detector ?
"[22:10] mn049 | u Yes . Yes . But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be . I d I don't see reason why it should be worse ."
"[22:13] me018 | Similar , yeah ."
[22:15] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[22:18] me018 | Yeah .
"[22:18] mn049 | Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection , we say "" well you know how come ? """
"[22:22] mn049 | Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them ."
[22:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[22:29] me018 | Yeah .
"[22:29] mn049 | We get this sort of improvement , how come that we don't see it on on on on your endpointed data ?"
[22:34] mn007 | Yeah .
"[22:35] mn007 | I guess it could be even better , because the voice activity detector that I choosed is something that cheating , it 's using the alignment"
[22:37] mn049 | I think so .
[22:42] mn049 | Yeah .
"[22:44] mn007 | of the speech recognition system ,"
[22:45] mn049 | C yeah uh and on clean speech data .
"[22:45] mn007 | and only the alignment on the clean channel , and then"
"[22:48] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[22:48] mn049 | Yeah . Well David told me David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent
[22:49] mn007 | mapped this alignment to the noisy channel .
[22:59] mn049 | he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent
[23:03] mn049 | uh comparing to to
[23:06] mn049 | endpointed baselines ? So they must have run already something .
[23:07] mn007 | Yeah .
[23:08] me018 | Hmm .
[23:09] mn049 | So .
"[23:11] mn049 | And Harry said "" Yeah . But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . """
[23:19] me018 | Hmm .
[23:22] mn049 | So . So there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion .
[23:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:27] mn049 | Because Nokia was objecting , with uh QualComm 's we basically supported that , we said "" yes "" ."
[23:32] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:33] mn049 | Now everybody else is saying "" well you guys might must be out of your mind . """
[23:37] mn049 | uh The Guenter Hirsch who d doesn't speak for Ericsson anymore because he is not with Ericsson and Ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole Aurora activity because they have so many troubles now .
[23:48] me018 | Wow .
[23:49] mn049 | Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people .
[23:51] me006 | Wow .
[23:51] me018 | Where 's uh Guenter going ?
[23:57] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:58] mn049 | he got a job uh at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen ."
[24:05] me018 | Hmm !
[24:05] mn049 | So it 's like professor u university professor
[24:08] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:08] mn049 | you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not"
"[24:13] mn049 | Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy ."
[24:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:17] me018 | Hmm !
[24:17] mn049 | And
"[24:18] mn049 | he well , he was hoping to work uh with Ericsson like on t"
"[24:23] mn049 | uh like consulting basis , but right now he says says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition ."
[24:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[24:30] me018 | Wow !
[24:30] mn049 | They think about survival .
[24:33] me018 | Hmm .
[24:34] mn049 | So .
[24:42] mn049 | that
"[24:43] mn049 | it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent . But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement ."
[24:46] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[24:57] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:01] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:05] mn007 | I I mean we are not too far from from fifty percent ,"
[25:09] mn007 | from the new baseline .
[25:11] mn007 | Which would mean like sixty percent
[25:13] mn049 | Yeah .
[25:14] mn049 | Yes . Yes .
"[25:16] mn049 | We we getting we getting there , right ."
[25:16] mn007 | Well .
"[25:18] mn007 | We are around fifty , fifty - five . So ."
[25:19] mn049 | Yeah .
[25:21] mn049 | Yeah .
[25:22] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:23] mn049 | Is it like sort of is How did you come up with this number ? If you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co"
[25:33] mn049 | computation ?
[25:34] mn049 | Uh - huh .
[25:37] mn049 | I think it 's about right .
"[25:39] mn049 | Yeah , yeah ."
[25:40] mn007 | Yeah . But .
[25:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:50] me018 | How 's your
[25:51] me018 | documentation or whatever it w what was it you guys were working on last week ?
"[25:55] mn007 | Yeah , finally we we 've not finished with this . We stopped ."
[25:59] fn002 | More or less it 's finished .
[26:00] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:01] fn002 | Ma - nec to need a little more time to improve the English ,"
"[26:06] fn002 | and maybe s to fill in something some small detail , something like that , but it 's more or less ready ."
[26:08] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[26:11] me018 | Hmm .
[26:13] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:15] mn007 | Well , we have a document that explain"
[26:17] fn002 | Necessary to to include the bi the bibliography . Mm - hmm .
[26:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[26:32] mn007 | Yeah . Right . We 've fff done some strange things like
"[26:42] mn007 | the vector of parameters , and we noticed that"
[26:45] mn007 | C - one is almost not useful at all .
[26:48] me018 | Really ? !
"[26:48] mn007 | You can remove it from the vector , it doesn't hurt ."
[26:50] me018 | That has no effect ?
[26:53] mn007 | Um .
"[26:55] mn007 | In the No , in the proposal ."
"[26:57] me018 | in uh - huh , uh - huh ."
"[27:00] mn049 | So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w driving in the car with Morgan this morning ,"
[27:01] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[27:05] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[27:05] mn049 | we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student
[27:11] mn049 | who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something
[27:19] mn049 | you will
"[27:20] mn049 | start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power ."
[27:27] me018 | In some what ?
[27:27] mn049 | General pow power . Like sort of you take a s
"[27:30] mn049 | power of two , or take a square root ,"
[27:31] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:32] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[27:33] mn049 | or something .
[27:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:34] mn049 | So suppose that you are working with a s C - zer C - one .
"[27:39] mn049 | So if you put it in a s square root ,"
[27:41] mn049 | that effectively makes your model half as efficient .
"[27:47] mn049 | Because uh your uh Gaussian mixture model , right ? computes the mean ."
[27:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:52] mn049 | And and uh i i i but it 's the mean is an exponent
[27:57] mn049 | of the
"[27:58] mn049 | whatever , the the this"
[28:01] mn049 | Gaussian function .
"[28:02] mn049 | So you 're compressing the range of this coefficient , so it 's becoming less efficient ."
[28:07] mn049 | Right ?
[28:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:07] mn049 | So . So .
"[28:09] mn049 | Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor , you know ,"
"[28:16] mn049 | uh in the you know , just compress the whole vector ."
[28:17] me018 | Oh .
[28:20] me018 | Yeah .
"[28:20] mn049 | And I said "" well in that case why don't we just start compressing individual elements , like when when because in old days we were doing when when people still were doing template matching and Euclidean distances ,"
"[28:31] mn049 | we were doing this liftering of parameters , right ?"
"[28:34] mn049 | because we observed that uh higher parameters were more important than lower for recognition . And basically the the C - ze C - one contributes mainly slope , and it 's highly affected by"
[28:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:46] mn049 | uh frequency response of the of the recording equipment and that sort of thing , so so we were coming with all these f various lifters ."
[28:50] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:54] mn049 | uh Bell Labs had he this uh
[29:06] mn049 | but uh
"[29:07] mn049 | we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters ."
[29:11] me018 | Hmm .
[29:12] mn049 | And . But so they may be a way to to fiddle with the f with the f
[29:17] me018 | Insertions .
[29:21] mn049 | giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters .
[29:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:34] mn049 | Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power ."
"[29:37] me018 | You need to have a genetic algorithm , that basically tries random"
[29:39] mn049 | I know . Exactly . Oh .
[29:41] me018 | permutations of these things .
[29:43] mn049 | If you were at Bell Labs or I d d
[29:50] mn049 | that 's what maybe that 's what somebody would be doing .
[29:52] me018 | Yeah .
[29:53] me006 | Hmm .
"[29:53] mn049 | Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power , so because it is really it 's a p"
[29:56] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[29:59] mn049 | it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search
[30:02] me018 | Yeah .
[30:02] mn049 | uh
[30:03] mn049 | but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this
[30:07] mn049 | uh
[30:09] mn049 | search like when we are searching say for best discriminants .
"[30:13] me018 | You know actually , I don't know that this wouldn't be all that bad . I mean you you compute the features once , right ?"
[30:17] mn049 | Yeah .
[30:17] mn049 | Yeah .
[30:18] me018 | And then
[30:18] mn049 | Absolutely .
[30:19] me018 | these exponents are just applied to that So .
[30:23] me018 | And is this something that you would adjust for training ? or only recognition ?
"[30:27] mn049 | For both , you would have to do ."
[30:29] mn049 | Yeah . You have to do bo both .
"[30:31] mn049 | Because essentially you are saying "" uh this feature is not important "" ."
[30:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:35] mn049 | Or less important , so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one , yeah ."
"[30:40] me018 | uh set of exponents that you would try , it would require a training and a recognition ?"
[30:42] mn049 | Yeah .
[30:43] mn049 | But but wait a minute . You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model .
[30:48] mn049 | You just may n may need to c uh give uh less weight
[30:53] mn049 | to
[30:54] mn049 | uh a mod uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature .
[30:59] mn049 | You don't have to retrain it .
"[30:59] me018 | Oh . So if you Instead of altering the feature vectors themselves ,"
[31:02] mn049 | You just multiply .
[31:03] me018 | you you modify the the the Gaussians in the models .
[31:05] mn049 | Yeah .
[31:06] mn049 | Yep .
"[31:07] mn049 | You modify the Gaussian in the model , but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power , but in a training what you c in a training uh in trained model ,"
[31:16] me018 | Uh - huh .
[31:16] mn049 | all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant .
"[31:21] me018 | But why if you 're if you 're multi if you 're altering the model , why w in the test data , why would you have to muck with the uh cepstral coefficients ?"
[31:27] mn049 | Because in uh test in uh test data you ca don't have a model . You have uh only data . But in a in a tr
[31:32] me018 | No . But you 're running your data through that same model .
"[31:39] mn049 | if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things ."
[31:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[31:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:44] mn049 | If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know"
[31:49] mn049 | the the the the component which I I mean di dimension
[31:50] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:53] me018 | All of the all of the mean and variances that correspond to C - one , you put them to zero . Yeah ."
"[31:55] mn049 | To the s you you know it . But what I 'm proposing now , if it is important but not as important , you multiply it by point one"
[32:04] mn049 | in a model .
"[32:10] mn049 | I think that you multiply the I would I would have to look in the in the math , I mean how how does the model uh Yeah ."
[32:18] mn049 | Yeah .
[32:18] me006 | Yeah .
[32:18] mn007 | Yeah .
"[32:19] mn049 | Effectively , that 's that that 's I Exactly . That 's what you do . That 's what you do , you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained ."
[32:20] me018 | wider or narrower .
[32:23] me006 | Yeah .
"[32:28] mn049 | Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model ,"
[32:33] mn049 | you put a constant .
[32:35] mn049 | S yeah effectively what you 're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation .
[32:40] mn049 | Right ?
[32:41] me018 | Oop . Sorry .
"[32:41] me006 | The spread , right ."
"[32:41] mn049 | Yeah , the spread ."
[32:42] me018 | So .
"[32:42] me006 | It 's the same same mean , right ?"
[32:47] mn049 | Yeah .
[32:47] me018 | uh your scores get worse for unless it 's exactly right on the mean .
"[32:53] mn049 | Your als No . By making it narrower ,"
[32:54] me018 | Right ?
[32:56] me018 | I mean there 's you 're you 're allowing for less variance .
[32:58] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:58] mn049 | Yes , so you making this particular dimension less important ."
"[33:02] mn049 | Because see what you are fitting is the multidimensional Gaussian , right ?"
[33:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:06] mn049 | It 's a it has it has uh thirty - nine dimensions , or thirteen dimensions if you g ignore deltas and double - deltas ."
[33:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[33:10] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:13] mn049 | So in order if you in order to make dimension which which Stephane sees uh less important ,"
"[33:20] mn049 | uh uh I mean not not useful , less important , what you do is that this particular component in the model"
[33:26] mn049 | you can multiply by w you can you can basically de - weight it in the model . But you can't do it in a in a test data because you don't have a model for th I mean
"[33:36] mn049 | uh when the test comes , but what you can do is that you put this particular"
[33:41] mn049 | component in and and you compress it .
"[33:43] mn049 | That becomes uh th gets less variance , subsequently becomes less important ."
[33:50] me018 | Couldn't you just do that to the test data and not
[33:53] me018 | do anything with your training data ?
"[33:54] mn049 | That would be very bad , because uh your t your model was trained uh expecting"
"[33:59] mn049 | uh , that wouldn't work . Because your model was trained expecting a certain var variance on C - one ."
[34:06] mn049 | And because the model thinks C - one is important .
"[34:09] mn049 | After you train the model ,"
"[34:14] mn049 | y you could do you could do still what I was proposing initially ,"
[34:18] mn049 | that during the training you you compress C - one
[34:22] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[34:22] mn049 | that becomes then it becomes less important
[34:25] mn049 | in a training .
"[34:27] mn049 | But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model . You train it on the original vector ."
"[34:37] mn049 | But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one"
[34:43] mn049 | you will
[34:44] mn049 | de - weight
"[34:46] mn049 | the C - one component in the model ,"
[34:48] mn049 | and you will put in the you will compress
[34:51] mn049 | the this component in a in the test data .
[34:54] mn049 | s by the same amount .
[34:55] me018 | if you wanted to try an experiment uh by leaving out
"[35:01] me018 | say , C - one , couldn't you , in your test data ,"
[35:05] me018 | uh
[35:06] me018 | modify the all of the C - one values
[35:10] me018 | to be um way outside of
[35:13] me018 | the normal range of the Gaussian
[35:15] me018 | for C - one that was trained in the model ?
"[35:17] me018 | So that effectively ,"
[35:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[35:19] me018 | the C - one
[35:20] me018 | never really contributes to the score ?
[35:24] me018 | Do you know what I 'm say
"[35:24] mn049 | No , that would be a severe mismatch , right ? what you are proposing ? N no you don't want that . Because that would then your model would be unlikely ."
"[35:27] me018 | Yeah , someth"
"[35:32] mn049 | Your likelihood would be low , right ?"
[35:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[35:34] mn049 | Because you would be providing severe mismatch .
"[35:36] me018 | But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ?"
[35:41] me018 | And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming
"[35:44] me018 | in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean"
[35:49] me018 | that your model had .
"[35:50] mn049 | No that would be very good match , right ?"
[35:52] me018 | Yeah .
"[35:52] mn007 | Which Well , yeah , but we have several means . So ."
"[35:55] mn049 | I see what you are sa saying , but"
[35:56] mn007 | Right ?
"[36:04] mn049 | No , you can't do that . Y you ca you ca Ch - Chuck , you can't do that . Because that would be a really f fiddling with the data , you can't do that ."
[36:08] me018 | Yeah .
[36:12] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[36:13] mn049 | But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record , right ? I mean y people will listen to it for for centuries now , is what you can do , is you train the model uh with the with the original data ."
[36:29] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[36:30] mn049 | Then you decide that you want to see how important C C - one is .
[36:42] mn049 | by two .
[36:44] mn049 | And you will compress your test data
[36:47] mn049 | by square root .
[36:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[36:49] mn049 | Then you will still have a perfect m match . Except that this component of C - one will be half as important in a in a overall score .
[36:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[36:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:57] mn049 | Then you divide it by four and you take a square , f fourth root ."
[37:00] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:01] mn049 | Then if you think that some component is more is more important then th th th it then then uh uh i it is ,"
[37:15] me018 | You 're talking about the standard deviation ?
"[37:16] mn049 | by by yeah . Yeah , multiply this component uh i it by number b larger than one ,"
[37:17] me018 | Yeah .
[37:22] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[37:23] mn049 | and you put your data in power higher than one .
[37:27] mn049 | Then it becomes more important .
"[37:29] mn049 | In the overall score , I believe ."
"[37:31] me018 | But don't you have to do something to the mean , also ?"
[37:33] mn049 | No .
[37:34] mn007 | No .
[37:34] mn049 | No .
[37:35] me006 | Yeah .
[37:36] mn007 | uh the The variance is on on the denominator in the in the Gaussian equation . So . I think it 's
[37:42] mn007 | maybe it 's the contrary .
"[37:44] mn007 | If you want to decrease the importance of a c parameter ,"
[37:47] mn049 | Yes .
[37:48] mn007 | you have to
[37:49] mn049 | Right .
[37:50] mn007 | increase it 's variance .
[37:50] mn049 | Yes .
[37:50] fn002 | Multiply .
"[37:51] mn049 | Exactly . Yeah . So you so you may want to do it other way around , yeah ."
[37:52] mn007 | Hmm .
[37:53] mn007 | That 's right . OK .
[37:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[37:55] me006 | Right .
[37:59] me018 | If your um original data
[38:02] me018 | for C - one had a mean of two .
[38:04] mn049 | Uh - huh .
[38:08] me018 | you 're you 're changing that
[38:10] me018 | by squaring it .
[38:11] me018 | Now your mean
[38:14] me018 | is four .
[38:16] me018 | But your model still has a mean of two .
[38:19] me018 | So even though you 've
"[38:20] me018 | expended the range , your mean doesn't match anymore ."
[38:23] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[38:26] me018 | Do you see what I mean ?
[38:27] mn049 | Let 's see .
"[38:27] mn007 | I think What I see What could be done is you don't change your features , which are computed once for all ,"
[38:33] mn007 | but you just tune the model .
[38:36] mn007 | So . You have your features . You train your your model on these features .
[38:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[38:40] mn007 | And then if you want to decrease the importance of C - one
[38:44] mn007 | you just take the variance of the C - one component in the in the model
[38:49] me018 | Yeah .
[38:53] me018 | Right .
[38:53] mn049 | Yeah .
[38:55] mn049 | You would have to modify the mean in the model . I you I agree with you . Yeah .
"[38:59] mn049 | Yeah , but I mean , but it 's it 's i it 's do - able , right ? I mean , it 's predictable ."
[39:00] mn007 | Well .
"[39:02] mn049 | Uh . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it 's predictable ."
"[39:03] me018 | It 's predictable , yeah ."
[39:04] me018 | Yeah .
[39:04] mn007 | Mmm .
[39:07] me018 | just muck with the variance .
"[39:07] mn007 | Just adjust the model , yeah ."
"[39:10] me018 | to get uh this uh this the effect I think that you 're talking about , right ?"
[39:13] mn049 | Mm - hmm .
[39:14] mn049 | It might be .
[39:15] me018 | Could increase the variance to decrease the importance .
[39:17] mn049 | Mm - hmm .
[39:18] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:19] me018 | Yeah , because if you had a huge variance ,"
"[39:22] me018 | you 're dividing by a large number , you get a very small"
[39:23] me006 | Right .
[39:24] mn049 | Yeah .
[39:24] me018 | contribution . Yeah .
[39:25] mn007 | Yeah .
[39:27] me018 | Hmm .
[39:30] me006 | more important to get that one right .
[39:31] mn049 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:32] me018 | Yeah , you know actually , this reminds me of something that happened uh when I was at BBN . We were playing with putting um pitch"
[39:38] mn049 | Mm - hmm .
[39:38] me018 | into the Mandarin recognizer .
[39:41] me018 | And this particular pitch algorithm
[39:43] me018 | um
"[39:44] me018 | when it didn't think there was any voicing , was spitting out zeros ."
"[39:49] me018 | uh when we did clustering , we were getting"
[39:52] me018 | groups uh of features
[39:56] me018 | with a mean of zero and basically zero variance .
[39:58] mn049 | Variance .
"[39:59] me018 | So ,"
"[40:00] me018 | when ener when anytime any one of those vectors came in that had a zero in it , we got a great score ."
"[40:05] me018 | I mean it was just , you know ,"
[40:07] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:07] me018 | incredibly high score , and so that was throwing everything off ."
[40:15] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:26] me018 | That doesn't require any retraining .
[40:28] mn049 | Yeah . No .
"[40:28] mn007 | No , that 's right ."
[40:29] mn049 | No .
[40:29] me018 | So that means
[40:30] mn007 | So it 's just
"[40:31] mn007 | tuning the models and testing , actually ."
[40:31] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:31] me018 | it 's just recognitions .
[40:32] me018 | Yeah .
[40:32] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:33] me018 | You you have a step where you
[40:33] mn007 | It would be quick .
"[40:35] me018 | you modify the models , make a d copy of your models with whatever variance modifications you make , and rerun recognition . And then do a whole bunch of those ."
[40:36] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:36] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[40:38] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:39] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:40] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:43] mn049 | Yeah .
[40:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:44] me018 | That could be set up fairly easily I think , and you have a whole bunch of"
[40:49] mn049 | Chuck is getting himself in trouble .
"[40:52] me018 | That 's an interesting idea , actually ."
[40:59] me018 | Huh !
[41:00] me006 | Didn't you say you got these uh HTK 's set up on the new Linux boxes ? Yeah .
[41:05] mn049 | Hey !
[41:11] me018 | the Linux box .
[41:12] me006 | Right .
[41:14] me018 | Yeah . Absinthe . Absinthe . We 've got five processors on that .
"[41:18] mn049 | that 's yeah , that 's a good thing because then y you just write the "" do "" - loops and then you pretend that you are working while you are sort of you c you can go fishing ."
[41:18] me006 | Oh yeah . That 's right .
[41:19] me018 | And two gigs of memory .
[41:22] mn007 | Yeah .
[41:23] me018 | Yeah .
[41:24] me018 | Exactly .
[41:28] mn049 | Yeah .
"[41:34] mn049 | Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was ,"
[41:39] mn049 | but it was reported to me
[41:41] mn049 | that uh somebody visited a company
"[41:44] mn049 | and during a d during a discussion ,"
[41:47] mn049 | there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns
[41:50] mn049 | uh on a computer .
[41:51] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[41:52] mn049 | So after two hours uh the visitor said "" wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? """
"[41:57] mn049 | And he said "" well you know , we are being paid by a computer"
[42:15] mn049 | Because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much
[42:19] me018 | Yeah .
[42:21] mn049 | time is being spent
[42:21] me018 | Idle time . Yeah .
[42:22] mn049 | I i i or on on this particular project .
[42:23] me006 | Yeah .
[42:31] me018 | It 's it 's this thing that 's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water ?
[42:37] mn049 | Yeah .
[42:38] mn049 | Yeah .
[42:39] mn049 | Yeah .
[42:41] mn049 | Yeah .
[42:44] me018 | That 's an interesting experiment .
[42:45] mn049 | It would be similar similar to I knew some people who were
"[42:48] mn049 | uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia , right ?"
"[42:51] mn049 | so we were watching for American airplanes , coming"
[42:53] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:54] mn049 | to spy on on uh on us at the time ,"
[42:56] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[42:57] mn049 | so there were three guys uh uh
[42:59] mn049 | stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely
"[43:02] mn049 | uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service right ?"
[43:12] me018 | Yeah .
"[43:13] mn049 | and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above ,"
[43:18] mn049 | and so that was the only work which they had .
[43:20] mn049 | They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno
"[43:24] mn049 | Basically f flying there ,"
"[43:32] mn049 | and quickly make a call , "" this plane is uh uh passing """
[43:36] mn049 | then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub .
[43:42] mn049 | And they were calling from the pub .
"[43:45] mn049 | but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore ."
"[43:54] mn049 | And one day there was there was no plane . At least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there , right ?"
[44:00] me018 | Yeah .
[44:05] me018 | And there wasn't ?
[44:15] mn049 | But uh .
[44:16] me018 | Huh !
[44:17] me018 | Well that 's that 's a really i
[44:18] mn049 | So . So . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[44:18] me018 | That wouldn't be too difficult to try . Maybe I could set that up .
"[44:22] mn049 | Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with ."
[44:26] mn049 | But then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them . It 's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the
[44:26] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[44:34] mn049 | uh distance measures . It might be that uh Yeah .
"[44:36] me018 | Yeah , so the first set of uh variance weighting vectors would be just you know one modifying one and leaving the others the same ."
[44:39] mn049 | Yeah .
[44:42] mn049 | Yeah .
[44:44] mn049 | Yeah .
[44:45] mn049 | Yeah .
[44:45] mn007 | Yeah . Maybe .
"[44:49] mn049 | in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable , right ?"
[45:00] mn049 | How do we Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
"[45:00] me018 | Wh - yeah , when the data matches that ,"
[45:04] me018 | Yeah . Right .
"[45:05] mn049 | How do we know , especially when it comes to noise ?"
[45:10] mn049 | Yeah ?
"[45:11] me018 | Because I Like , I 've noticed in the higher cepstral coefficients , the numbers seem to get smaller , right ?"
[45:18] me018 | So d
"[45:19] mn007 | They t Yeah . They have smaller means , also ."
"[45:19] me018 | I mean , just naturally ."
[45:24] me018 | Yeah . Exactly .
[45:24] mn007 | Uh .
[45:25] me018 | And so it seems like they 're already sort of compressed .
[45:29] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[45:30] me018 | The range of values .
[45:31] mn049 | Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh
[45:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:37] mn049 | Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance
[45:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:41] mn049 | with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data .
[45:46] me018 | Hmm .
[45:46] mn049 | What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance . Turns out that uh the variance decreases
"[45:54] mn049 | at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients . I think you can show that uh uh analytically ."
[45:57] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[46:01] me018 | Hmm .
[46:01] mn049 | So typically what happens is that you you need to weight the uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients .
[46:10] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[46:13] me018 | Hmm .
[46:19] mn049 | So .
[46:22] mn049 | When Yeah . When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for
[46:29] mn049 | uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center .
"[46:40] mn049 | Uh even when there is absolutely nothing to to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in in Berkeley . I 'm sure that it 's being appreciated in Oregon and maybe it will generate similar responses down here ,"
[46:54] mn007 | We can set up a webcam maybe .
[46:55] mn049 | Yeah .
"[47:00] mn049 | What you know , nowadays , yeah . It 's actually do - able , almost ."
"[47:07] me018 | Is the um if we mail to "" Aurora - inhouse "" ,"
[47:11] me018 | does that go up to you guys also ?
[47:13] mn049 | I don't think so . No .
[47:13] mn007 | No .
[47:15] mn049 | So we should do that .
[47:16] me018 | Yeah we sh Do we have a mailing list that includes uh the OGI people ?
[47:16] me006 | Yeah .
[47:18] mn049 | Yeah .
[47:19] mn007 | Uh no . We don't have .
[47:21] me018 | Oh !
[47:21] mn049 | Uh - huh .
[47:21] me018 | Maybe we should set that up . That would make it much easier .
"[47:23] mn049 | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that would make it easier ."
"[47:28] mn049 | Yeah . Yeah . And then we also can send the the dis to the same address right , and it goes to everybody"
[47:32] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[47:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[47:33] mn007 | Yeah .
[47:36] me018 | OK .
[47:36] me018 | Maybe we can set that up .
"[47:37] mn049 | Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people"
"[47:41] mn049 | essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered , right ? but what the the then the danger is in a group like this ,"
[47:47] mn049 | is that two people are working on the same thing
[47:50] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:50] mn049 | and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something ."
"[47:58] mn049 | Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report . Lucash , I think ,"
[48:03] mn049 | uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system .
[48:07] mn049 | reasonably
"[48:08] mn049 | uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel , but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything . Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways ."
[48:20] me018 | Hmm !
[48:21] mn049 | u s
[48:22] mn049 | And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use .
[48:31] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[48:32] mn049 | It might be a reasonable point for p perhaps uh start converging .
[48:33] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:38] mn049 | Because Morgan 's point is that He is an experienced guy . He says "" well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you"
"[48:43] mn049 | are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes ,"
[48:50] mn049 | Which which uh uh
"[48:52] mn049 | one is using that set of hurdles , another one set is using another set of hurdles . So ."
[48:57] mn049 | And then it 's difficult to c compare .
[49:02] mn007 | What about Harry ? Uh .
[49:03] mn007 | We received a mail last week and you are starting
[49:07] mn049 | He got the he got the software . Yeah . They sent the release . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[49:07] mn007 | to to do some experiments .
[49:09] mn007 | And use this Intel
[49:11] mn007 | version .
[49:12] mn049 | Yeah .
[49:13] mn007 | Hmm .
"[49:15] mn049 | Yeah because Intel paid us uh should I say on a microphone ? uh some amount of money , not much . Not much I can say on a microphone . Much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work ."
"[49:27] mn049 | And they wanted uh to to have software so that they can also play with it , which means that it has to be in a certain environment they use actu actually some Intel"
[49:32] me018 | Hmm .
"[49:37] mn049 | libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh including ICSI software"
[49:48] me018 | Hmm .
"[49:49] mn049 | uh not for training on the nets but I think he rewrote the the the or so maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that so that the whole thing , including MLP , trained MLP is"
[49:49] me006 | Oh .
[49:57] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[50:03] mn049 | one piece of
[50:04] mn049 | uh software .
[50:06] me018 | Wow !
[50:08] mn049 | Is it useful ?
[50:10] mn049 | Yeah ?
[50:10] me006 | Ye -
"[50:11] me006 | Yeah . I mean , I remember when we were trying to put together all the ICSI software for the submission ."
"[50:23] mn049 | and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up , and so I think it this is available ."
[50:27] me006 | Yeah .
[50:27] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[50:32] me006 | Hmm .
"[50:33] mn007 | Well , the the only thing I would check is"
"[50:36] mn007 | if he does he use Intel math libraries , because if it 's the case ,"
[50:40] mn049 | uh e ev
[50:42] mn049 | n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation because I think he started first just with a plain C C or C - plus - plus or something
[50:47] mn007 | Ah yeah .
[50:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[50:53] mn049 | before I I can check on that . Yeah .
[50:55] mn007 | Yeah . OK .
[50:56] me018 | Hmm .
"[50:57] mn049 | And uh in otherwise the Intel libraries , I think they are available free of f freely ."
[51:03] mn049 | But they may be running only on on uh on uh Windows .
[51:04] mn007 | Yeah .
"[51:09] mn049 | Yeah , on Intel architecture , may not run in SUN ."
[51:10] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:12] mn049 | Yeah .
[51:12] mn049 | That is p that is that is possible .
[51:14] me018 | Hmm .
"[51:17] mn049 | That 's why Intel of course is distributing it , right ?"
[51:17] mn007 | Well .
[51:20] mn007 | Yeah .
[51:22] mn007 | Well there are at least there are optimized version for their architecture .
[51:25] mn049 | Yeah .
[51:26] mn007 | I don't know . I never
[51:29] mn049 | I know there was some issues that initially of course we d do all the development on Linux
[51:33] mn049 | but we use we don't have we have only three uh uh uh uh s SUNs
[51:39] mn049 | and we have them only because they have a SPERT board in .
"[51:42] mn049 | Otherwise otherwise we t almost exclusively are working with uh PC 's now , with Intel ."
"[51:49] mn049 | In that way Intel succeeded with us , because they gave us too many good machines"
[51:52] me018 | Yeah .
[51:53] mn049 | for very little money or nothing . So .
[51:56] me018 | Wow !
[51:57] mn049 | So .
[51:58] mn049 | So we run everything on Intel .
[52:02] me018 | Hmm .
[52:09] me018 | Shall we read some digits ?
[52:10] mn007 | Yeah .
[52:11] mn049 | Yes .
"[52:12] me018 | So . Hynek , I don't know if"
[52:15] mn049 | No .
[52:18] mn049 | Mm - hmm .
[52:18] me018 | and uh
"[52:19] me018 | you say the transcript number and then you read the digits ,"
[52:23] me018 | the the strings of numbers as individual digits .
"[52:26] me018 | So you don't say "" eight hundred and fifty "" , you say "" eight five oh "" , and so forth ."
[52:27] mn049 | OK .
[52:28] mn049 | OK .
[52:29] me018 | Um .
[52:29] mn049 | So can maybe can I t maybe start then ?
[52:31] me018 | Sure .

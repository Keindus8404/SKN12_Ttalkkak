[00:02] mn021 | OK .
[00:03] me011 | OK . Thank you very much .
[00:03] mn082 | OK .
[00:04] mn082 | We can start ?
[00:04] mn021 | OK .
"[00:05] mn082 | OK . So , welcome to our next meeting . Uh , today we will have a talk from Miguel Sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad - hoc networks ."
"[00:16] mn082 | We have here a guest , a former ICSI member of the NSA group , Jordi Domingo Pasqual . He is , uh , assistant professor at UPC ."
"[00:26] mn082 | And maybe Jordi , you have a few words concerning your work one or two sentence and because we will have tomorrow a talk from him in more detail concerning what 's going on ."
"[00:39] mn040 | Eh , you you want me to say Oh !"
"[00:40] mn082 | Yeah , only a short introduction , ve very short introduction , please ."
"[00:42] mn040 | Of course . Eh , well , I 'm working in the em Broadband Commu -"
"[00:46] mn082 | Uh , sorry , one interruption ."
"[00:48] mn082 | This is not related to hearing , it 's only for"
[00:55] mn082 | No . So .
"[00:57] mn082 | Yeah , yeah . Like this one . Yeah ."
"[01:00] mn040 | Ah , that 's uh much more comfortable ."
[01:01] mn082 | Yeah ? OK .
"[01:06] mn040 | I 'm uh working in the Broadband Communications Group and eh ,"
[01:14] mn040 | I P - eighty traffic monitoring and characterization
"[01:17] mn040 | and em eh tool developing tools uh for quality of service , eh"
"[01:27] mn040 | That 's eh And we have several projects eh both Spanish and European projects , ongoing"
[01:37] mn082 | OK . Thank you .
[01:55] mn082 | and
"[02:06] mn082 | deployed to everybody , but it was only sent to me , so in the meantime everybody got , I believe , this pointer from me , and"
[02:17] mn082 | to get a little bit familiar with these things .
"[02:21] mn082 | And um so I believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion , maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days , until the next meeting ."
[02:32] mn082 | And when we are ready with our meeting .
"[02:35] mn082 | Everything is done . Then , uh , we have to read these number"
[02:40] mn030 | OK .
[02:43] mn021 | OK .
[02:45] mn021 | Thank you .
"[02:45] mn021 | Well , eh , I I have prepared , eh , a really short talk"
[03:01] mn021 | Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation .
"[03:04] mn021 | I will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad - hoc networks are ,"
"[03:20] mn021 | and , eh , I will make some comments also about uh the current standards of wireless local area networks"
[03:38] mn021 | So the first thing is eh what an ad - hoc network is .
"[03:44] mn021 | You know , uh , an ad - hoc network is made of wireless nodes ."
"[03:49] mn021 | These nodes of course can be mobile nodes ,"
"[03:54] mn021 | and , eh in this network there is no network infrastructure ."
[03:59] mn021 | So eh the only active thing we have
[04:03] mn021 | is the mobile nodes .
[04:06] mn021 | And eh
"[04:09] mn021 | end - to - end communication ,"
"[04:11] mn021 | is sometimes , uh done by direct communication from one node to the other ,"
"[04:20] mn021 | But sometimes it is not possible , this direct communication , because nodes ,"
[04:26] mn021 | end uh source or and destination nodes
[04:29] mn021 | are um are too far away .
"[04:31] mn021 | And in this case , it can be done , communication can be done , by uh using multi - hub routing ."
[04:39] mn021 | So
"[04:39] mn021 | an intermediate , or a set of intermediate nodes"
[04:43] mn021 | will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination .
[04:53] mn021 | So
"[04:54] mn021 | uh in a sense , what we have in this kind of networks , is that , uh nodes are as both arced as both"
[05:04] mn021 | uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes .
[05:09] mn021 | And this makes a uh difference from other kind of network .
"[05:22] mn021 | eh we can say that , well , cellular networks are infrastructure - based networks ,"
"[05:30] mn021 | in this kind of ad - hoc networks , we don't have anything uh , with the exception of the network nodes . So , this uh network can be useful for eh"
"[05:53] mn021 | um catastrophe catastrophic event ,"
"[05:57] mn021 | or , also when even when there is a network available , we don't want , for different reasons , to use the available network ."
"[06:07] mn021 | This latt later case can be , for example , the use in military systems ,"
"[06:12] mn021 | where maybe we don't want to use the other the enemy network infrastructure , for evident reasons ."
[06:20] mn021 | Yeah .
[06:21] mn082 | Hmm ?
"[06:21] mn082 | But you can also , I believe , uh to have an ad - hoc network , where one node is then connecting to the outer world ."
"[06:29] mn082 | For instance , what I have in mind , you have a car , where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other , for instance ,"
"[06:34] mn082 | but one device decided to go to the G S M network or GPS network , or whatever kind of things ."
[06:39] mn021 | That 's OK .
[06:40] mn082 | So there 's a certain kind of task
"[06:42] mn082 | uh , for one node within the ad - hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world , right ?"
"[06:46] mn021 | That 's O K . That 's perfect , you know . This in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway ,"
[06:47] mn082 | OK .
[06:48] mn082 | Yeah .
"[06:54] mn021 | from this network to connect to other networks ,"
[06:57] mn082 | Right .
"[07:04] mn021 | Uh , OK . Here you have several several uh , proposed , uh , scenarios for for used this networks . When"
"[07:11] mn021 | no network is available , OK ? And another another application ,"
"[07:17] mn021 | for example , NASA is is uh studying , is uh the use of these networks , these ad - hoc networks , for sending multiple probes , uh , um uh missions ."
"[07:31] mn021 | So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission , the cellular vehicle was only one ,"
"[07:43] mn021 | and was uh walking around , uh roaming around the base station , which in this case was the"
"[07:51] mn021 | gateway uh node of this network , but it was only one mobile node , of course . Nothing prevents ,"
"[08:10] mn021 | higher area could be covered , could be explored"
"[08:15] mn021 | and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing ,"
"[08:22] mn021 | to extend the distance , the maximum distance , than uh a single radio transmission will would allow ."
[08:30] mn021 | OK ?
"[08:31] mn021 | And in the other case ,"
"[08:34] mn021 | or the other area uh of of of application , is the so - called network of sensors ,"
"[08:41] mn021 | where we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area ,"
"[08:47] mn021 | let 's say , for example , the forest ,"
[08:49] mn021 | and we can uh
[08:52] mn021 | take some information
"[08:53] mn021 | uh , for example for for fire - fighting ,"
"[08:57] mn021 | we can just launch from a plane , several small sensors ,"
[09:02] mn021 | and uh
"[09:03] mn021 | these sensors can be for example ,"
"[09:05] mn021 | uh checking that there is no fire , they can have some kind of uh let 's say infrared technology sensor ,"
"[09:12] mn021 | so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of of sensors , and without any other infrastructure ."
[09:21] mn021 | Yeah .
"[09:22] mn030 | Um , is that really an ad - hoc network ? Because the sensors are not moving ."
[09:27] mn030 | And I think it 's makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are .
[09:32] mn021 | Yeah .
[09:33] mn030 | So .
"[09:33] mn021 | Well ,"
"[09:34] mn021 | You know , it 's an interesting question . Uh , the the main thing about an ad - hoc network is not that nodes move ."
[09:42] mn021 | It is
[09:43] mn021 | the way of topology changes can happen .
[09:46] mn021 | The idea that
"[09:48] mn021 | mmm , any change is possible at any given moment ."
"[09:53] mn021 | But you can of course ask , "" but if the nodes are not moving , what"
"[09:56] mn021 | kind of topology changes can we expect ? """
[09:59] mn030 | Yeah . That 's it .
"[09:59] mn021 | Well , eh , the thing is that usually in in a n in a network of sensors , what we have , or the idea is to have"
[09:59] mn082 | Yeah .
"[10:07] mn021 | um , an important number of sensors ,"
[10:11] mn021 | and maybe with a high filer rate .
[10:14] mn021 | maybe the batteries
[10:17] mn021 | are uh
[10:19] mn021 | exhausted in some nodes because maybe
[10:21] mn030 | OK . Mm - hmm .
"[10:21] mn021 | uh they are not being able to take uh , let 's say , any sun to recharge its cells ,"
[10:27] mn021 | uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh
[10:30] mn021 | out of order for other eh environmenta environmental conditions .
[10:36] mn021 | So uh the idea is that
"[10:38] mn021 | even when these nodes are not moving ,"
[10:40] mn021 | they can start and stop working
"[10:43] mn021 | at uh , let 's say , higher pace ."
"[10:46] mn021 | Then , uh what will happen in a in a regular network , uh in a network where you don't have"
"[10:52] mn021 | or either mobility or uh this uh on - off uh rate , high rate ."
[10:56] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[10:59] mn030 | Hmm .
[11:00] mn021 | Yeah .
"[11:03] mn082 | here , at ICSI or whatever kind of thing , what will happen then even in a fixed network ?"
[11:06] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:08] mn082 | So , if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing , so the topology has changed , even if no node is moving ."
[11:15] mn030 | OK .
"[11:17] mn030 | Mm - hmm , OK ."
[11:18] mn082 | Yeah .
[11:18] mn082 | And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network .
"[11:24] mn021 | Thank you , Joe ."
"[11:24] mn030 | Yeah , I see . Mm - hmm ."
"[11:26] mn021 | Well , uh , you know , and finally , uh , another non - military applications , where"
"[11:32] mn021 | uh maybe a network is available , like for example , a room like this ,"
"[11:35] mn021 | where we have , in fa in fact , a wired infrastructure ,"
[11:39] mn021 | but this uh possible application of ad - hoc networks could be
"[11:45] mn021 | uh , any place , any meeting room , where we arrive with our computers"
[11:51] mn021 | and eh we just can communicate
"[11:54] mn021 | seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point , any kind of uh"
[12:00] mn021 | mmm
"[12:00] mn021 | external network ,"
"[12:02] mn021 | because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based , it 's only"
"[12:08] mn021 | to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person , which is in front of us ."
"[12:13] mn021 | OK , but we n don't want to product pro provide , eh , access to the internet or something . OK ?"
"[12:20] mn021 | And , of course , the same eh the same scenario , could also happen in a place where"
"[12:27] mn021 | there is no uh , infrastructure available . Let 's say a meeting room"
"[12:31] mn021 | uh , in in the middle of the desert ,"
"[12:33] mn021 | OK ? , without any other network ."
[12:38] mn021 | So
"[12:39] mn021 | the point or or the question could be for some of us ,"
"[12:43] mn021 | the idea of saying "" OK , That sounds OK , but why not to use a longer transmission range , so we can reach any destination in just one hop ? """
"[12:55] mn021 | This seems to make sense because , well , uh we are this way"
[13:00] mn021 | avoiding all the routing problem
"[13:02] mn021 | that , well , we will talk a little bit uh ,"
"[13:08] mn021 | it seems that i probably that the problem is is not an easy one ,"
"[13:12] mn021 | because uh a node 's moving , the route is changing , so"
[13:16] mn021 | w one can think that routing in this uh scenario is is a complex thing .
[13:20] mn021 | But the problem is if w
"[13:22] mn021 | we just uh try to put more power in each tr transmitter ,"
"[13:27] mn021 | so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop ,"
[13:32] mn021 | what we are doing is
"[13:35] mn021 | uh to rising the power needs of each node , and also we are reducing the network uh throughput , because we are"
[13:44] mn021 | only allowing one transmissio one transmission at a time .
"[13:48] mn021 | Because uh , well , we cannot allow several transmissions ,"
[13:53] mn021 | several high - powered transmissions at the same time
[13:55] mn021 | because
[13:56] mn021 | one is interfering with the other .
[13:58] mn021 | OK ?
[14:03] mn021 | that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes .
[14:07] mn021 | OK ?
[14:08] mn021 | So that 's why we cannot allow
[14:10] mn021 | several transmitters
[14:12] mn021 | in the same channel
[14:13] mn021 | at the same time .
[14:14] mn021 | OK ?
"[14:15] mn021 | So , the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one ."
"[14:22] mn021 | or at least it has the drawbacks um , um , I was telling you ."
"[14:28] mn021 | Eh , let 's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks ,"
"[14:35] mn021 | Uh , you know , the"
[14:38] mn021 | easiest eh way to to show how this works
"[14:41] mn021 | is or at least one of I think one of the easiest is that this drawing , or this picture ,"
"[14:48] mn021 | what we have is a set of nodes , each one at a different location ."
[14:54] mn021 | at a given moment
"[14:56] mn021 | this eh node , this dash node is is transmitting"
"[15:00] mn021 | and uh ,"
[15:02] mn021 | the arrows are representing
[15:05] mn021 | this transmission
"[15:06] mn021 | and the receiving nodes ,"
"[15:08] mn021 | these three nodes ,"
"[15:09] mn021 | are receiving the transmission ,"
[15:12] mn021 | and
[15:12] mn021 | I 'm trying to uh show
"[15:15] mn021 | the area , the covered area , for of this transmission"
[15:19] mn021 | by means of this uh dashed eh line circle .
[15:22] mn021 | OK ?
"[15:23] mn021 | So , uh , any transmission"
[15:29] mn021 | and uh
"[15:30] mn021 | in the simpler way ,"
[15:32] mn021 | we can see this like a circle with the center
[15:35] mn021 | in the transmitter
[15:37] mn021 | and a certain radius .
[15:39] mn021 | OK ?
[15:40] mn021 | The value of this radius
"[15:43] mn021 | in principle , is a fixed value and it depends on the uh power"
[15:48] mn021 | of the transmitter .
"[15:50] mn021 | Of course ,"
[15:50] mn021 | uh this is only our uh simplife simplified model
"[15:55] mn021 | and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot ,"
[15:59] mn021 | OK ? And in fact
"[16:01] mn021 | the real behavior is not exactly this one , but"
[16:04] mn021 | uh for for what
[16:05] mn021 | I want
"[16:06] mn021 | to say it 's it 's OK , it 's enough ."
[16:09] mn021 | OK ?
[16:10] mn021 | So
[16:12] mn021 | what are the differences
"[16:15] mn021 | uh , in this in this eh wireless transmission ,"
[16:18] mn021 | regarding
[16:19] mn021 | uh
[16:20] mn021 | to the wireless to the wired ones .
[16:22] mn021 | What what are the d the main differences .
"[16:25] mn021 | Well , the main differences"
"[16:28] mn021 | come from the fact that , uh"
[16:30] mn021 | in uh in uh wireless transmission we have
[16:34] mn021 | a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal .
[16:40] mn021 | And the point
"[16:41] mn021 | I 'm trying to show in this picture ,"
[16:44] mn021 | is that
"[16:44] mn021 | if for example ,"
[16:46] mn021 | this other node
"[16:47] mn021 | wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting ,"
"[16:51] mn021 | if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme , like for example , CSMA ,"
"[16:56] mn021 | or something uh uh derivated from it ,"
[17:00] mn021 | the problem is that this node will hear
[17:02] mn021 | the g the m
"[17:04] mn021 | the transmission media ,"
[17:06] mn021 | it won't be able to hear anything
"[17:09] mn021 | so ,"
[17:10] mn021 | he will conclude
"[17:11] mn021 | no other transmission is going on ,"
[17:14] mn021 | and he will start transmitting .
[17:16] mn021 | And
"[17:17] mn021 | if he does , what will happen"
[17:19] mn021 | is that this node and this other node
"[17:22] mn021 | will also receive this transmission ,"
"[17:24] mn021 | and this will produce , at least at these two nodes ,"
[17:28] mn021 | a collision
[17:29] mn021 | or a m a m a a re a bad reception .
[17:32] mn021 | OK ?
[17:32] mn021 | So
[17:33] mn021 | none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly
[17:38] mn021 | received at this node
[17:39] mn021 | nor at this other node .
"[17:42] mn021 | OK , eh , this problem is what"
"[17:46] mn021 | Oh , sorry ."
[17:48] mn021 | I think this is the previous one ?
[17:51] mn082 | Uh .
[17:52] mn035 | No .
[17:53] mn035 | One
"[17:53] mn082 | Yes , this one ."
"[17:53] mn021 | OK , thank you ."
[17:53] mn035 | @ @
[17:55] mn021 | Eh
"[17:56] mn021 | this is what is called a "" hidden terminal "" problem ."
[17:59] mn021 | OK ?
[17:59] mn021 | because
[18:00] mn021 | well uh
[18:02] mn021 | this node is not able to hear
[18:04] mn021 | this other node because of the distance
[18:08] mn021 | But
"[18:09] mn021 | Uh , this problem ,"
"[18:10] mn021 | as you can see in the in the picture ,"
[18:13] mn021 | is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes .
"[18:17] mn021 | OK , so"
[18:19] mn021 | it is a problem
[18:21] mn021 | that we have to address and it is a new problem compared to
[18:25] mn021 | wired uh media access control .
"[18:28] mn021 | And , uh , well ,"
[18:30] mn021 | some devel some protocols have been developed
[18:33] mn021 | to avoid
[18:33] mn021 | this problem and
[18:35] mn021 | to try to address
[18:36] mn021 | this particular behavior
[18:38] mn021 | of wireless transmissions
[18:40] mn021 | and the main idea
[18:42] mn021 | is to use
[18:43] mn021 | some kind of a reservation mechanism .
[18:46] mn021 | So
[18:47] mn021 | we are
[18:49] mn021 | um
[18:50] mn021 | reserving
"[18:51] mn021 | a certain , and a specific uh ,"
[18:53] mn021 | area of space
[18:54] mn021 | so we can
[18:58] mn021 | is trying to use the same space
[19:00] mn021 | at the same time .
[19:01] mn021 | OK ? This is the basic idea .
[19:02] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:03] mn082 | Um Miguel , can you give some examples for such kind of protocols ?"
[19:03] mn021 | Yeah ?
[19:07] mn021 | Yeah .
[19:09] mn082 | OK .
"[19:10] mn082 | Yeah , yeah . OK ."
"[19:11] mn021 | OK , in eh the the the main idea"
"[19:14] mn021 | and and the base of most of this protocols ,"
[19:17] mn021 | is what this the so - called RTS CTS uh dialogue .
"[19:21] mn021 | The idea is that , uh ,"
"[19:24] mn021 | of course , this is only intended for unicast transmissions ,"
"[19:27] mn021 | I mean ,"
[19:28] mn021 | only for when
[19:29] mn021 | a node wants to transmit something to
[19:32] mn021 | a neighbor node . OK ?
[19:34] mn021 | But not to broadcast .
"[19:36] mn021 | Uh , to all the nodes ."
[19:38] mn021 | OK .
"[19:38] mn021 | For this for this eh , work ,"
[19:40] mn021 | the transmitter
[19:41] mn021 | has to send
"[19:43] mn021 | a a a reservation packet called RTS , "" Request To Send "" ,"
[19:48] mn021 | before
[19:49] mn021 | eh being able to send data .
[19:52] mn021 | And the receiver
[19:54] mn021 | is expected to
[19:55] mn021 | return back
"[19:56] mn021 | another packet called CTS , "" Clear To Send "" ,"
[20:01] mn021 | to allow the transmitter to send the data .
[20:04] mn021 | If the transmitter
"[20:05] mn021 | receives successfully the CTS packet from the destination ,"
"[20:10] mn021 | then it will be able to send eh the packet , the data packet ."
"[20:14] mn021 | If not ,"
[20:15] mn021 | it will h
"[20:16] mn021 | uh , back off , and it will retry"
[20:18] mn021 | uh sometime later .
[20:20] mn021 | OK ?
[20:21] mn082 | And the media is is is still
[20:26] mn021 | Uh . Yes .
[20:27] mn021 | Yes .
[20:27] mn082 | OK .
[20:28] mn021 | The idea is
"[20:29] mn021 | uh , if I want to send you something ,"
"[20:32] mn021 | first of all , I need"
[20:34] mn021 | you to answer me
[20:36] mn021 | to be sure that you are
[20:37] mn021 | my neighbor now because maybe you are off or maybe you are
"[20:41] mn021 | uh too far away ,"
[20:42] mn021 | and also because that way
"[20:45] mn021 | Miguel , for example , it may be is not being able to hearing me"
[20:49] mn021 | will hear your CTS and will know
[20:51] mn021 | that you are about to receive
[20:53] mn021 | uh data from me .
[20:55] mn021 | OK ?
[20:56] mn021 | So
"[20:57] mn021 | in fact , forcing the receiver to transmit"
[21:00] mn021 | for a short period of time
[21:03] mn021 | is also
"[21:04] mn021 | uh , used to signal all the"
[21:07] mn021 | uh receiver
[21:09] mn021 | neighbors
[21:10] mn021 | that a recept a reception is taking place .
[21:14] mn021 | OK ?
"[21:14] mn082 | Yeah . I didn't get it . Um , what happened when I sent an RTS packet ?"
[21:19] mn082 | Is then the media still occupied for me ?
"[21:23] mn082 | Or , is anybody allowed also to send RTS packets ?"
"[21:27] mn082 | Because if I go to an intermediate node , maybe you are communicating to me and I am the intermediate node to the final destination Michael ."
[21:34] mn082 | And Michael send also some RTS packet in the time and and uh uh
[21:38] mn082 | uh Jordi too and whatever .
[21:40] mn021 | Yeah .
[21:42] mn082 | then you 're always exchanging RTS and non - acknowledgement
[21:46] mn021 | OK .
[21:46] mn082 | packets for the RTS .
[21:47] mn021 | Two two things .
"[21:47] mn082 | So that 's uh that 's uh , my my problem ."
"[21:49] mn021 | First of all , eh , this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism , so it is not connected with routing eh , anyhow ."
"[21:57] mn082 | Then , fine ."
"[21:58] mn021 | And , second point ,"
[21:59] mn082 | OK .
[22:00] mn021 | eh
"[22:04] mn021 | Yeah ,"
[22:04] mn082 | transmissions ? OK .
[22:05] mn021 | RTS packets can collide to other RTS packets .
"[22:09] mn021 | So , this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions ,"
[22:18] mn021 | OK ?
[22:18] mn082 | OK .
"[22:20] mn021 | And and you can say "" OK ,"
"[22:22] mn021 | but what is the what the benefit is ? """
"[22:24] mn021 | The benefit is that , eh"
[22:27] mn021 | RTS packets and CTS packets
"[22:29] mn021 | are short packets ,"
[22:31] mn021 | really short packets . Let 's say eh eh 30 bytes or less .
[22:33] mn082 | I assume so . Yeah .
[22:36] mn021 | while data packets can be
"[22:38] mn021 | much mor much bigger . Let 's say uh one - K , five - K - s ."
[22:42] mn021 | OK ?
[22:44] mn082 | Yeah .
[22:44] mn021 | So
[22:44] mn082 | Fine .
[22:48] mn021 | is only wasting a small amount of time .
"[22:52] mn021 | And , uh"
[22:53] mn021 | if that way we can warranty
[22:56] mn021 | that there is there are there is no collision
[22:59] mn021 | uh
"[23:00] mn021 | uh , between data packet ,"
"[23:03] mn021 | well , this this is this means a a huge eh increase"
"[23:07] mn021 | in network throughput ,"
"[23:09] mn021 | because we well , we we only waste really small time colliding ."
"[23:16] mn082 | OK , but that means , in principle , that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet"
[23:16] mn021 | OK ?
"[23:22] mn082 | between neighboring nodes ,"
[23:24] mn021 | Yeah .
[23:24] mn082 | and you send afterwards the data . But the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always
"[23:35] mn082 | before you can forewarning the data , right ?"
"[23:38] mn021 | Yeah . It is a reservation mechanism , so"
[23:38] mn082 | Yeah .
[23:40] mn082 | OK .
"[23:40] mn021 | if reservation doesn't work OK ,"
[23:43] mn021 | if uh one reservation
[23:45] mn021 | don't succeed
"[23:46] mn021 | then ,"
"[23:48] mn021 | uh , this transmission"
[23:49] mn021 | should have to wait .
[23:51] mn082 | Now the p
"[24:03] mn082 | So this is what , node one ? This is node two and this is the source ,"
[24:06] mn021 | Yeah .
[24:08] mn082 | and this is node three that is the final destination .
[24:10] mn021 | Yeah .
[24:10] mn021 | Fo - fo for forget forget about routing .
[24:10] mn082 | Yeah ?
"[24:12] mn082 | Yeah , yeah . OK ."
"[24:13] mn082 | But - but anyway , I would like to do that in the ad - hoc network . This is maybe the sco this is within the scope"
"[24:19] mn082 | this , uh special network . That means here that is uh within the transmission"
[24:24] mn021 | OK .
[24:26] mn082 | power .
"[24:27] mn082 | So if I send an RTS , and get back , um , a CTS ,"
[24:29] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:33] mn082 | then he is allowed to send data , right ?"
[24:35] mn021 | That 's OK .
"[24:36] mn082 | So . In the meantime ,"
"[24:41] mn082 | and then CTS because this is the next next scope of the transmission area , and then he can send the data , right ?"
[24:44] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[24:48] mn021 | OK .
[24:50] mn082 | That 's the case ?
[24:51] mn021 | That 's it .
[24:51] mn082 | Yeah ? And that 's what I mean .
"[24:53] mn082 | In the meantime , he c still can get some data here ,"
[24:56] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[24:56] mn082 | where he try to get certain connectivity on the MAC layer .
[25:03] mn021 | is only involved in one transmission at a given time .
[25:07] mn021 | So
[25:08] mn021 | if now
[25:09] mn021 | two
[25:10] mn021 | has
"[25:11] mn021 | uh mmm answer with the with the CTS ,"
[25:14] mn082 | Yeah ?
[25:14] mn021 | it will be waiting
[25:15] mn021 | until the data
[25:17] mn021 | that has to come .
"[25:19] mn082 | OK , and then he try to forward this data ."
[25:19] mn021 | OK ?
[25:21] mn021 | Yeah .
[25:22] mn082 | After that . So he is definitely first to stop . He has to collect all the data ?
[25:22] mn021 | But n not before .
[25:25] mn021 | Yeah .
"[25:26] mn082 | Could it not be a little bit strange because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes ,"
[25:31] mn082 | he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to to whatever .
[25:33] mn021 | we are we are talking only about a data packet .
[25:35] mn082 | Huh ?
[25:36] mn082 | One data p He have to do it for all data packets ?
[25:37] mn021 | at the MAC layer .
[25:39] mn021 | Yeah .
[25:39] mn082 | OK .
[25:42] mn082 | OK .
[25:49] mn082 | The same applies for the next data packet .
[25:50] mn021 | Yeah .
"[25:51] mn021 | All the packets ,"
[25:52] mn021 | all unicast packets .
[25:52] mn082 | but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination .
[25:57] mn021 | Yeah .
[25:58] mn021 | That that true .
[25:58] mn082 | Right ?
[25:59] mn021 | That 's true .
[25:59] mn021 | But not in the meantime .
"[26:02] mn021 | You know ,"
"[26:03] mn021 | in fact , probably the routing protocol"
"[26:07] mn021 | the the let 's say IP address ,"
[26:07] mn082 | OK .
[26:10] mn082 | Yeah .
[26:10] mn021 | which is
"[26:11] mn021 | inside the data packet , so ,"
"[26:13] mn021 | you cannot u usually you cannot , uh ,"
[26:20] mn021 | is over .
[26:22] mn021 | OK ?
[26:22] mn021 | because usually your network hardware
[26:25] mn021 | only
[26:26] mn021 | provides you a copy of a packet
[26:28] mn021 | after ou a a successful reception
[26:31] mn021 | and usually
[26:32] mn021 | you know that reception is successful
[26:35] mn021 | if
[26:36] mn021 | every bit has passed the CRC
[26:39] mn021 | check .
[26:40] mn021 | OK ?
[26:40] mn021 | You have checked that the that this frame has received
[26:41] mn082 | Naja to to @ @
[26:42] mn082 | Yeah .
[26:45] mn021 | OK ?
"[26:45] mn082 | Mm - hmm . Yeah , @ @ . OK ."
[26:47] mn021 | So
"[26:47] mn030 | Um , a further question . Um . Am I right that this um dialogue does not prevent"
[26:48] mn021 | Yeah .
[26:49] mn021 | That 's OK .
"[26:54] mn030 | um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of , yeah , N - one ."
"[27:01] mn021 | Yeah , let me let me put some"
[27:02] mn030 | S
[27:04] mn021 | special representation of what we are doing .
"[27:11] mn021 | this is the receiving node ,"
"[27:14] mn021 | and these two areas ,"
"[27:15] mn021 | of course , there 's something like this ,"
[27:18] mn021 | are
[27:19] mn021 | the uh
[27:23] mn021 | total space
[27:24] mn021 | where
"[27:26] mn021 | Here , this one is the RTS and this one is the CTS ."
[27:30] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:31] mn021 | So , any node ,"
"[27:32] mn021 | for example , this node is a neighbor of the receiving node ,"
[27:36] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[27:36] mn021 | but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node .
[27:39] mn030 | Yeah . That 's it .
[27:40] mn021 | So when
[27:42] mn021 | this node hears the CTS transmission
[27:44] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:45] mn021 | that is performed by the receiver ,"
[27:47] mn021 | this will be
"[27:48] mn021 | uh informed , that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it 's area ."
[27:55] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[27:55] mn021 | OK ?
[27:56] mn021 | So
"[27:56] mn021 | in fact , this node"
[27:58] mn021 | will avoid any
[27:59] mn021 | further transmission until
"[28:01] mn021 | uh this reception ,"
"[28:03] mn021 | that will start in in a moment ,"
[28:06] mn021 | is over .
"[28:07] mn030 | But then this node , um , this transmission is uh aborted ."
[28:07] mn021 | OK ?
[28:11] mn082 | And delayed . Yeah .
"[28:11] mn030 | And so there 's no advantage to uh if it 's aborted , by by any data packets ."
[28:18] mn030 | So this um node has to stop each transmission .
[28:22] mn021 | Yeah .
"[28:22] mn030 | So , even the at - the - moment - ongoing transmission ."
[28:27] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[28:27] mn030 | Is that right ?
[28:28] mn021 | Yeah .
"[28:29] mn030 | So , his transmission is aborted ."
[28:36] mn021 | show you one thing .
"[28:37] mn021 | If this node was transmitting before ,"
[28:41] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:41] mn021 | it should
[28:42] mn021 | uh
"[28:43] mn021 | it should ha uh transmit an RTS packet in advance , OK ?"
[28:48] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:48] mn021 | So this node
[28:50] mn021 | should hear it before .
[28:50] mn030 | Yeah .
[28:50] mn082 | Yeah . Yeah .
[28:51] mn030 | That 's right .
[28:51] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:52] mn030 | OK .
[28:53] mn030 | Yeah .
[28:53] mn021 | W won't be sending the eh
[28:56] mn021 | eh CTS packet
[28:58] mn021 | to the transmitter .
[28:58] mn082 | Yeah .
[28:59] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:59] mn021 | So this transmission won't take place .
"[29:01] mn030 | OK , yeah ."
[29:02] mn082 | It 's always true that only one node
[29:02] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:05] mn082 | gets a media access ,"
[29:06] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:07] mn082 | for one frame . That 's the point . We always said "" from data "" but it 's really one frame ."
[29:08] mn021 | M Yeah .
[29:10] mn021 | Yeah .
"[29:11] mn082 | Yeah , OK ."
"[29:11] mn021 | And , in fact , uh there is another detail , it is not uh"
"[29:15] mn021 | uh uh uh in on the on the slide , and it is that"
[29:19] mn021 | both
[29:21] mn021 | the RTS and the CTS packet
"[29:25] mn021 | uh ,"
"[29:26] mn021 | have a field , a control field"
[29:29] mn021 | where the total length of the data packet is shown .
[29:33] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[29:33] mn021 | So
[29:34] mn021 | when you hear one
"[29:36] mn021 | uh CTS or one uh RTS packet ,"
[29:40] mn021 | you know
[29:41] mn021 | that the frame
[29:48] mn021 | You know the length .
"[29:49] mn021 | You know the bit rate , so you know"
[29:50] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[29:51] mn021 | that the amount of time you have to wait until
[29:54] mn021 | you can
"[29:55] mn021 | try to get the control , or t try to send your own transmission ."
[29:59] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:00] mn030 | OK , but"
"[30:01] mn030 | this scenario is also nov uh , only working if um both or all"
[30:07] mn030 | nodes have the same range of transmission .
"[30:11] mn030 | So , the s same radius of the sending range ."
"[30:14] mn021 | Mmm , yeah ."
[30:20] mn030 | would hear his neighbor but not vice versa .
"[30:24] mn021 | Uh , well , we are assuming that uh mmm"
[30:28] mn021 | all the all the transmissions
[30:30] mn021 | are bidirectional .
"[30:32] mn021 | I mean ,"
[30:33] mn021 | uh
[30:35] mn021 | you know
[30:36] mn021 | it depends . It depends mainly on on the antenna gain
[30:42] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[30:42] mn021 | and the transmission power and the
[30:44] mn021 | receiver uh threshold .
[30:46] mn030 | Mm - hmm . But I 'm thinking about this example you gave before .
[30:47] mn021 | OK ?
[30:47] mn082 | Uh - huh . Maybe maybe you are right .
[30:48] mn021 | S
[30:49] mn021 | So what what we are assuming is that all the nodes
[30:53] mn021 | behave exactly the same regarding to
[30:55] mn021 | uh transmission and receiving signals .
"[30:57] mn082 | Yeah , but , Miguel , this is a good point from from Dietmar , but maybe here is a wall ."
[30:58] mn030 | Yeah .
[31:05] mn021 | Yeah but but yeah
"[31:07] mn021 | but the but in this case ,"
[31:09] mn021 | you know
"[31:09] mn021 | this this idea ,"
"[31:11] mn021 | this uh geometric idea ,"
"[31:13] mn021 | can be can be ,"
"[31:14] mn021 | if you want , uh"
[31:16] mn021 | deformed
[31:17] mn021 | because of some obstacles .
[31:19] mn021 | OK ? But this wall is working both ways .
[31:23] mn021 | It is not only
"[31:24] mn021 | making this node not to hear this one ,"
[31:27] mn021 | it 's also making this one not to hear this node .
[31:30] mn021 | So
"[31:32] mn021 | Because of this wall ,"
"[31:33] mn021 | if they are not neighbors , well ,"
[31:36] mn021 | we can represent this
[31:37] mn021 | putting this node
[31:38] mn021 | like here .
[31:40] mn030 | But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one .
[31:40] mn021 | OK ?
"[31:44] mn021 | No , but this is not the scenario we are assuming ."
[31:45] mn030 | OK . So that was my question .
[31:47] mn021 | Yeah .
[31:47] mn082 | Mm - hmm . OK .
[31:48] mn021 | We are assuming all the nodes
[31:49] mn021 | are exactly the same .
[31:51] mn030 | OK .
"[31:51] mn021 | Uh , so they transmit the same power ,"
[31:54] mn021 | and they uh have the same uh
[31:56] mn021 | uh sensitivity .
[31:58] mn030 | Mm - hmm . OK .
"[32:00] mn021 | If if if I can hear you , you can hear me ."
[32:02] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[32:03] mn021 | and and the opposite
[32:04] mn021 | works also .
[32:05] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:05] mn021 | OK , if you cannot hear me , I cannot hear you ."
"[32:07] mn030 | Mm - hmm . OK . It 's a assumption it 's it 's clear . But on the other hand , um , in a real world it isn't , or ? Um ."
"[32:16] mn021 | Uh not really , but also depends on uh you know , for example power relationships ,"
[32:23] mn021 | and antenna relationships .
"[32:24] mn030 | Yeah , eh that 's it ."
"[32:25] mn021 | You know , eh"
"[32:30] mn021 | one kind of thing , OK , if I use a directional antenna ,"
"[32:34] mn021 | this is making that in one direction ,"
[32:36] mn030 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[32:36] mn021 | I 'm getting more
[32:38] mn021 | uh let 's say more gain
"[32:40] mn030 | Yeah , OK ."
[32:43] mn021 | What is also true is that one directional antenna works both ways .
[32:43] mn030 | You 're not assuming this . Yeah .
[32:48] mn021 | It provides you more gain when you are transmitting but also when you are receiving .
"[32:53] mn021 | so , in general , in general even when if there uh if there i are different antenna gains ,"
"[33:00] mn021 | uh , you 're getting mainly bidirectional channels ."
[33:05] mn021 | Only when you have a an important uh power difference
[33:09] mn021 | is when
"[33:11] mn021 | l um , the communication can only work one way ."
[33:13] mn030 | Yeah .
[33:14] mn030 | OK .
"[33:14] mn021 | For example , you have one"
[33:16] mn021 | big station
[33:18] mn021 | with uh
"[33:19] mn021 | a lot of transmission power ,"
[33:22] mn021 | and then you have a really small mobile uh thing
[33:24] mn030 | Yeah .
"[33:26] mn030 | Yeah , a cellular phone and a car ."
[33:26] mn021 | that can hear perfectly
"[33:28] mn021 | the signal from this uh uh bigger station ,"
[33:31] mn021 | but it has not enough power to transmit something that can be heard here .
[33:35] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[33:36] mn030 | Yeah .
"[33:37] mn021 | So um But this this this is not our scenario . In our scenario , all the nodes are exactly the same ."
[33:39] mn030 | OK .
[33:42] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[33:46] mn030 | OK .
[33:46] mn021 | They they have the same uh
[33:46] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[33:48] mn021 | signal uh behavior .
[33:50] mn021 | So
"[33:51] mn021 | this is not a problem for us ,"
"[33:54] mn021 | at least for the moment , maybe"
[33:56] mn021 | later
[33:57] mn021 | we 'll see some differences .
[33:59] mn021 | So
"[34:01] mn021 | You know , the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism ."
[34:05] mn021 | And what we are doing here
[34:07] mn021 | is try to reserve the area of space we are covering
[34:11] mn021 | and eh here 's where our some of our work is done .
"[34:17] mn021 | The main idea for for our work , is"
"[34:21] mn021 | well , if we are using this reservation mechanism , we are reserving an area of space"
"[34:29] mn021 | for a single transmission . Uh , if this area is bigger than what is really needed , we are , somehow , wasting"
[34:38] mn021 | a little bit of space .
"[34:41] mn021 | our first eh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values , these uh"
"[34:53] mn021 | the area , the covered area , for a single transmission , trying to get a minimum value ,"
[35:03] mn021 | reduce the not - used space for other
[35:07] mn021 | simultaneous transmissions .
[35:10] mn021 | And this will
"[35:21] mn021 | And , we have , uh"
"[35:28] mn021 | uh , in two different uh ways ."
[35:30] mn021 | One of these ways has been try to find a mechanism to uh
"[35:43] mn021 | uh , and to get an equal value for all the transmitters ."
[35:53] mn021 | to obtain a fixed value for the transmission range .
"[35:58] mn021 | And the second eh work ,"
[36:04] mn021 | It is about
"[36:07] mn021 | uh , an algorithm to adapt the transmission power for every for every single transmission ."
"[36:15] mn021 | So , uh , in this second part of our work ,"
[36:24] mn021 | So .
[36:33] mn021 | the transmission range uh for uh
"[36:40] mn021 | for an escenario where we know the number of nodes and the area of deployment , we have a a fixed area ,"
"[36:51] mn021 | we have a fixed number of nodes ,"
"[36:53] mn021 | and , uh we assume that these nodes are moving freely around this this area"
"[37:00] mn021 | and , uh , what we have presented , is a mechanism to uh"
[37:06] mn021 | calculate to obtain the eh transmission radius
[37:13] mn021 | that provides at the same time that provide us
[37:21] mn021 | OK ?
[37:27] mn021 | which is a problem that we are trying to avoid .
"[37:31] mn021 | You know , if we have , because of node motion , we have something like this ,"
"[37:37] mn021 | this is the deployment area of or or node , and if we have some nodes here and some nodes here , well maybe these nodes in this area ,"
[37:49] mn021 | cannot reach the nodes on this other area .
[37:53] mn021 | OK ?
[37:57] mn021 | Of course we can choose uh our transmission values
[38:01] mn021 | longer enough to reach from so the nodes from this area will be able to reach the nodes on this other area .
[38:10] mn021 | OK ?
"[38:14] mn021 | if uh , nodes are moving , uh more or less uh in a random fashion , this configuration is not very likely to happen ."
[38:27] mn021 | OK ?
[38:35] mn021 | uh one uh value
[38:38] mn021 | for a given uh mmm probability .
[38:42] mn021 | OK ?
"[38:58] mn021 | Sorry . for a certain , for a certain probability ."
"[39:02] mn021 | OK ? So , the point is"
"[39:04] mn021 | uh , we cannot say that this is not gonna happen , what we can say is this is not very likely to happen , if nodes move"
[39:12] mn021 | uh uh random .
"[39:14] mn082 | Yeah , but um Miguel ,"
[39:14] mn021 | OK ?
[39:16] mn021 | Yeah .
[39:21] mn021 | Yeah . This is the next .
"[39:23] mn082 | if I send something and I could not find any neighbor because one of the cluster below ,"
[39:28] mn082 | is it not possible to extend the power
"[39:30] mn082 | until the maximum and if uh I do not have any connectivity with the maximum of power , OK ,"
[39:31] mn021 | u
[39:32] mn021 | e
[39:35] mn082 | then I 'm lost anyway .
[39:35] mn021 | e
"[39:36] mn021 | Yeah , but this is this is a way that it is it is being explored by other researchers ,"
"[39:37] mn082 | Yeah , yeah ."
[39:52] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[39:54] mn021 | related to to uh the control of the transmission power to get
"[39:59] mn021 | uh certain properties uh from your network , like for example ,"
[40:03] mn021 | they are what they are doing eh is eh some people working for BBN
[40:09] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[40:17] mn021 | these guys are doing eh what they call
"[40:20] mn021 | uh "" B - connected networks "" , they are trying all the network nodes to have at least"
[40:25] mn021 | two neighbors .
"[40:26] mn082 | OK , mm - hmm ."
[40:27] mn021 | OK ?
"[40:33] mn021 | this number of neighbors , but this is not what I am doing and uh the kind of power control I am doing"
[40:48] mn021 | with the minimum power needed
[40:51] mn021 | depending on the distance to the destination .
[40:55] mn021 | OK ? Every transmission
[40:56] mn021 | is supposed to be done to a certain neighbor node
[41:00] mn021 | we cull the neighbors to these nodes which are
[41:07] mn021 | OK ?
[41:08] mn021 | and because we wanted to to compare
"[41:11] mn021 | our algorithm with something , we needed to compare it with the no power control , which is the usual uh mechanism"
[41:20] mn021 | at this eh media access control level .
[41:25] mn021 | is to to compare our mechanism against
"[41:28] mn021 | the no power control , but again we have to fix in order to be able to compare , we have to fix a given"
"[41:35] mn021 | whatever , but a given uh maximum transmission range to compare ."
[41:47] mn021 | taking the advantage that we are u
"[41:50] mn021 | we have this RTS CTS dialogue ,"
"[41:53] mn021 | in advance , before sending the data ,"
"[41:58] mn021 | agree with the receiver , the power level he is willing to get from us ."
[42:08] mn021 | in every single transmission we are checking with the receiver the power level we have to use
[42:21] mn082 | how do you check if if the nodes are moving randomly ?
"[42:24] mn021 | Well , uh we are assuming that e y for at least for uh veh uh you know , uh , car"
[42:31] mn021 | and and walking or or people riding a mo motorcycle
[42:42] mn021 | very very small um space can be can be eh travelled while the transmission is taking place .
[42:52] mn021 | in one millisec
"[42:52] mn082 | Yeah , OK , maybe that 's applied for RTS CTS , but for the real frame ?"
"[43:00] mn082 | I don't know but a few hundred bytes , you know , that takes a little bit time ."
"[43:04] mn021 | Yeah but , i"
[43:05] mn021 | let 's say you have one kilobyte .
[43:08] mn021 | OK ?
[43:08] mn021 | One kilobyte is uh eight uh
[43:13] mn021 | bits .
[43:15] mn021 | OK ?
[43:16] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:17] mn021 | And eh , if you are transmitting at , let 's say , uh at one megabit per second ,"
[43:23] mn021 | this means one microsecond per bit .
[43:27] mn021 | OK ?
"[43:28] mn021 | So this only is taking eight milliseconds ,"
"[43:32] mn021 | which is not a lot of time if you are travelling , let 's say , at uh one hundred kilometers per second ."
"[43:40] mn082 | No , s no sorry m Yeah , that 's right ."
[43:40] mn021 | Oh per per hour . Sorry .
"[43:44] mn082 | But first of all it took place RTS CTS , and there could be , you mentioned , if it 's still occu if the medium is still occupied by another one , it will be delayed anyway to a randomly time ."
"[43:52] mn021 | Yeah ,"
[43:52] mn021 | it will be delayed but you will start from scratch again .
"[43:57] mn021 | I mean , it will be a start with another RTS CTS ."
"[43:58] mn082 | Oh , so ! OK , y OK . OK . I see . Yeah . OK ."
[44:01] mn021 | OK ?
"[44:02] mn021 | But , anyway , uh , well , depending on on the network , you now , the the the this I will have to translate this ,"
[44:12] mn021 | uh
"[44:21] mn021 | So , this should be something like"
[44:33] mn021 | per second .
[44:34] mn021 | OK ?
"[44:35] mn082 | Oh yeah , something like that . It 's OK ."
"[44:36] mn021 | So in in eight milliseconds , well , the amount of of space you are travelling is not too much ."
"[44:49] mn021 | I 'm of course , I 'm also"
"[44:51] mn021 | uh using a conservative value for the transmission speed , now you can get much more"
"[45:01] mn021 | the thing is , uh , that we are assuming that for a given transmission , we can"
[45:07] mn021 | uh consider the network as if it were
[45:13] mn021 | built of a set of static nodes .
[45:16] mn021 | OK ?
"[45:17] mn021 | Motion will be important for routing ,"
"[45:21] mn021 | but for the media access control level ,"
[45:24] mn021 | we are considering that motion can be con is not is not important .
[45:30] mn021 | OK ?
"[45:34] mn082 | cases why I go this way with my node , and suddenly , I s go out of the scope of the transmission area , because it 's really a random movement ."
[45:43] mn082 | Then I still hear this is during the data transmission .
"[45:47] mn021 | Yeah , but again again , what we are"
[45:47] mn082 | Yeah ?
"[45:52] mn021 | uh a little bit more , probably some some"
[45:56] mn021 | uh small part to the uh bit error rate .
"[46:00] mn021 | OK ? Maybe this frame will won't be received properly ,"
"[46:04] mn021 | and , should eh have to be eh dropped , but anyway ,"
"[46:05] mn082 | Oh , yeah ."
"[46:08] mn021 | eh even if nodes are completely static , eh some problems will happen in the wireless transmission , so"
[46:20] mn082 | Yep . Right .
"[46:26] mn021 | Y you can you can see that it is not very likely to happen , because you you you eh have to consider"
[46:35] mn021 | the probability that
"[46:38] mn082 | Nee . That 's really right , but what I would like to say is that besides the RTS CTS behavior , you need certain kind of additional"
[46:39] mn021 | Hmm ?
"[46:46] mn082 | MAC layer functionality to deal with these packet . For example , with transmission or or whatever ,"
[46:47] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[46:50] mn021 | Yeah , sure , sure ."
"[46:51] mn082 | for whatever control , or whatever kind of things , you know ."
"[46:55] mn021 | I I maybe I I I had to to prepare a more detailed eh , view , I I just was trying to do something soft ,"
[47:12] mn082 | Right . Yeah .
[47:18] mn021 | Some protocols used
"[47:20] mn021 | uh in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet some of them use ,"
"[47:25] mn021 | an eh acknowledge from the receiver ,"
[47:30] mn021 | so you you are getting some kind of link layer uh acknowledgement scheme
[47:35] mn021 | which can save a lot of data transmissions because eh
"[47:45] mn021 | So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS ,"
"[47:52] mn021 | well , this takes longer than just a link layer"
"[47:56] mn021 | uh , extra packet ."
"[47:58] mn021 | That , of course"
[47:59] mn021 | uh is also contemplated in this eh
"[48:04] mn021 | length or included in the RTS and CTS packets , so , eh , you know , everybody can wait until this uh acknowledgement is also transmitted"
[48:14] mn021 | by the receiver .
[48:16] mn021 | So
"[48:17] mn021 | in fact , eh nnn some people proposing this mechanism"
"[48:25] mn021 | and eh there are a lot of other mechanisms , also regarding and a time - out mechanism , or the time - out algorithm for these retries when you try to send something and you don't succeed , uh , what what you"
[48:41] mn021 | the amount of time you have to wait until you retry again .
"[48:45] mn021 | Well ,"
"[48:45] mn021 | uh , some people is also proposing"
"[48:48] mn021 | different things , different eh algorithms with different results ."
[48:55] mn021 | I just was trying to present a you know the main ideas .
"[49:04] mn021 | You Feel free to ask uh whatever you want , but"
"[49:11] mn021 | uh a simplified uh version , a light version ."
[49:15] mn021 | OK ?
"[49:17] mn021 | well , uh you know"
"[49:19] mn021 | finally this algorithm , eh , as I was telling ,"
[49:23] mn021 | eh what it 's doing is to check with the receiver
[49:28] mn021 | And it is very simple to see that
"[49:33] mn021 | some advantage can be obtained , because"
"[49:37] mn021 | eh if you don't have power control , you are using all the time the maximum power ,"
[49:48] mn021 | How often do you use less power than the maximum ?
"[49:52] mn021 | Well ,"
[49:53] mn021 | this will be connected to the motion pattern .
[49:57] mn021 | OK ?
[50:00] mn021 | well
"[50:05] mn021 | But ,"
"[50:05] mn021 | this probably , doesn't l look like uh something very"
[50:14] mn021 | probably y what you will have will be some neighbors that are
[50:16] mn082 | Hmm .
[50:29] mn021 | OK .
[50:29] mn082 | Hmm .
[50:29] mn021 | Yeah .
"[50:29] mn082 | OK , this is a question not directly related to these things , but maybe that 's why maybe only a short answer ."
"[50:36] mn082 | Uh , do you assume that power control will be issue also in the next years ?"
"[50:49] mn082 | success of having more power within the devices in maybe three year , four years , five years ,"
"[50:54] mn082 | for batteries , and and and @ @ and sofort so on"
[50:58] mn082 | uh will it be succeeded that you have so much power available that this difficult mechanism who is in the wireless network will be uh out of scope ?
[51:09] mn021 | Yeah .
"[51:09] mn082 | Because if I have a device which uh can I use maybe for twenty - four hours ,"
"[51:14] mn082 | I do not have , in principle , really the constraint to uh"
[51:18] mn082 | deal with with uh power savings .
[51:20] mn021 | let me let me answer you uh with a question .
"[51:24] mn021 | Uh ,"
"[51:25] mn021 | If , for example , your car"
"[51:33] mn021 | do you think it will it will be a problem ,"
[51:40] mn021 | OK . It won't be
"[51:49] mn021 | So , I think that the answer to your question is"
"[52:02] mn021 | But , it is a problem because you are using more area"
[52:06] mn021 | And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place
[52:11] mn021 | And therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power
[52:17] mn021 | it is also connected to the net to the global network throughput .
[52:23] mn021 | OK ?
[52:23] mn082 | OK .
"[52:28] mn021 | But ,"
"[52:32] mn021 | If you ask me "" what what do you think what will happen ,"
[52:36] mn021 | What I think that will happen is that they will
[53:31] mn021 | to p l the part of the of the radio frequency power you have to transmit .
[53:39] mn021 | But what you can avoid or you can reduce
[53:58] mn021 | OK ?
"[53:59] mn082 | Yeah , but anyway , that was the reason for my question . If I save"
"[54:02] mn082 | with a lot of difficult mechanism , within the air interface and between the base station or access point and the mobile node , one percent of the power whereas ninety - nine percent is consumed by"
"[54:13] mn082 | packet processing and and and and uh uh C P U or whatever ,"
[54:16] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[54:17] mn082 | is it worth to have it ?
[54:26] mn082 | And I think it will be increased .
[54:28] mn082 | As the more mobile nodes are in the world the better the battery will be .
[54:32] mn082 | So that 's was the reason for my question .
"[54:36] mn021 | Yeah , pero e"
"[54:36] mn082 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[54:37] mn021 | But even if you if you don't have to to worry about eh your power source ,"
[54:45] mn021 | about not using more resources
[54:45] mn082 | Yeah .
[54:48] mn082 | Yeah .
"[54:49] mn082 | Yeah , I g got it . Yeah . Yeah ."
[54:50] mn021 | uh shared about w w among the community .
"[54:54] mn040 | Excuse me @ @ . If I understood correctly , the mechanism"
[54:55] mn021 | OK .
[54:56] mn021 | Yeah .
[55:01] mn040 | look for um the minimum
[55:04] mn040 | coverage range
[55:05] mn040 | in order to maximize the throughput of the network . So there the the power control
[55:06] mn021 | Yeah .
"[55:11] mn040 | eh algorithm should work , in order to use at each instant of time the minimum power need"
[55:18] mn040 | to reach
[55:19] mn040 | the neighbor .
[55:21] mn040 | That Because this is the way
[55:26] mn040 | may take take place at the same time .
"[55:26] mn082 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[55:28] mn040 | So you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range .
[55:33] mn082 | Yeah .
[55:34] mn021 | That 's OK .
[55:35] mn021 | And to and to get the maximum network throughput .
[55:38] mn021 | That 's that 's the idea .
"[55:40] mn021 | However however , and"
"[55:43] mn021 | uh , it is always some however ,"
"[56:07] mn021 | So , uh"
"[56:10] mn021 | at the end of the road ,"
"[56:18] mn021 | OK ? So ,"
"[56:27] mn021 | OK ? because if not ,"
[56:36] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[56:36] mn021 | OK ? because of the of high interference levels .
[56:40] mn021 | A lot of simultaneous transmissions also means
"[56:52] mn021 | And , all the transmitters"
[57:13] mn021 | OK ?
[57:20] mn021 | OK .
"[57:37] mn021 | uh called "" Manit "" ."
"[57:55] mn021 | Uh , and"
"[57:58] mn021 | at this moment there are ,"
"[58:00] mn021 | I would say , a lot"
[58:05] mn021 | uh
"[58:07] mn021 | for uh end - to - end traffic and also for multicast traffic ,"
[58:13] mn021 | And eh well
[58:16] mn021 | some day in the future
"[58:19] mn021 | eh , a protocol should be"
[58:27] mn021 | several of them on the table .
[59:00] mn021 | So any route that was going through this neighbor
"[59:11] mn021 | an if you let me a personal comment ,"
[59:16] mn021 | on the group is not to agree
[00:03] mn021 | which are um extensions of of uh
[00:46] mn021 | they are trying to solve on only
"[01:01] mn021 | And then ,"
[01:30] mn021 | these proposals are are trying to get
[02:05] mn021 | OK ?
[02:20] mn082 | Mmm . What do you mean by multicast protocols ? Routing ?
[02:22] mn021 | Yeah .
[02:23] mn021 | Routing protocols intended for multicast .
[02:24] mn082 | OK . Yeah .
[02:26] mn082 | OK . Yeah .
[02:30] mn021 | Hmm ?
"[02:31] mn021 | Uh well ,"
[03:06] mn082 | And maybe we will have to explain a little bit for those who are not familiar with source routing . You can have the
[03:13] mn021 | Yeah .
[03:14] mn082 | or the in the I P addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know
"[03:18] mn082 | even if it 's not the direct neighbor , but one of"
"[03:21] mn082 | uh where you really want that the packet went through , put it in the I P header ."
[03:25] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:25] mn082 | So , and ,"
[03:26] mn082 | this one
"[03:27] mn082 | is going then to this guy and so on and so on , until finally it 's reached destination ."
[03:36] mn030 | OK .
"[03:40] mn030 | So there 's more than one IP address in the header , and OK , I see ."
"[03:43] mn082 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[03:52] mn082 | Yeah .
[03:54] mn021 | like this way .
[03:54] mn030 | Do they have to be in order ?
[03:56] mn030 | So you are looking first for node two and then for node three and so on .
[03:57] mn021 | Yeah .
"[04:00] mn082 | You 'll know to remove h it 's h from the header , in principle , and and so on ,"
[04:03] mn030 | OK .
[04:05] mn082 | until it uh reaches the final destination .
[04:05] mn030 | OK .
"[04:08] mn021 | So this this uh header , well ,"
"[04:26] mn082 | This one , for instance . that may that the different parts could be one to number four ."
[04:31] mn030 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[04:33] mn082 | two - B or three - B
"[04:35] mn082 | Yeah , but nevertheless this guy is a is an"
"[04:38] mn082 | gateway in the router for for this packet , you know ."
[04:41] mn082 | And they remove itself from the header .
[04:43] mn030 | OK .
[04:43] mn082 | Yeah .
[04:44] mn021 | Anoth -
"[04:44] mn082 | It must be not the whole path , you know ."
[04:46] mn021 | Another problem
"[05:06] mn021 | But , again"
"[05:09] mn082 | Um , Miguel , are you familiar with these kind of proposals ?"
[05:12] mn021 | Not really .
"[05:16] mn021 | You know ,"
[05:41] mn082 | That depends on the service level you want to be .
[05:43] mn082 | Definitely not a guarantee level .
"[05:46] mn082 | But maybe something like a control load level or something like that , seems to be for me possible . Right ?"
[05:52] mn082 | Yeah .
[05:58] mn082 | Hmm .
"[05:59] mn082 | Yeah , we can discuss later , off - line . OK ."
[06:00] mn021 | Yeah .
"[06:01] mn021 | And eh , finally ,"
[06:10] mn021 | to have some kind of a power - aware routing .
[06:18] mn021 | routing function could be
"[06:28] mn021 | nnn , the network to transmit your packet"
[06:42] mn021 | OK ?
"[06:43] mn021 | I mean ,"
[06:44] mn021 | would the option for me to to use less power
"[06:54] mn021 | OK , assuming that I 'm I 'm also using s or having some kind of power control thing ."
[07:26] mn021 | OK ?
"[08:14] mn082 | Yeah , but it 's really happened also in the riot case , you know ."
"[08:17] mn082 | If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects ,"
[08:18] mn021 | Yeah .
"[08:20] mn082 | it 's , in principle , then the same ."
[08:21] mn021 | Yeah . That 's O K .
"[08:22] mn082 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[08:24] mn021 | So , these are more or less uh some"
"[08:27] mn021 | open problems ,"
"[09:30] mn021 | l what we call the "" infrastructure mode "" ,"
"[09:55] mn082 | Yeah , in principle , the base station ."
"[09:57] mn021 | Yeah , yeah , we can call it a base station ."
[09:57] mn082 | Yeah .
[09:59] mn082 | Yeah .
[10:21] mn021 | OK ?
"[10:34] mn021 | OK , we can build on top of this some"
[10:45] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:46] mn082 | and Miguel , should I should ask you one question ."
[10:48] mn021 | Yeah .
"[10:48] mn082 | And uh uh in version one and two you you have different technologies . You know ,"
"[10:52] mn082 | frequency hopping , uh two modes and and and also infrared ."
[10:52] mn021 | Yeah .
[10:54] mn021 | Yeah .
[10:56] mn082 | Does it still apply for for the uh eleven - B ?
"[11:06] mn082 | OK , DSS . OK . OK ."
"[11:07] mn021 | But , in fact , there is an ongoing new version , I think it 's c version - A ,"
[11:21] mn082 | OK .
"[11:51] mn082 | Megahertz , yeah ."
[11:53] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:58] mn021 | but not the older ones the oldest ones ,"
"[12:04] mn082 | Uh , gigahertz ."
[12:05] mn082 | Yeah .
[12:06] mn082 | In the RSM band .
"[12:56] mn082 | Yeah . And one additional question from myself , but maybe also short , because time it running fast ."
"[13:01] mn082 | Uh , I have heard that uh wireless LAN and Bluetooth will have some problems"
[13:06] mn082 | uh that they influence each other . Do you have additional information about this topic ?
[13:07] mn021 | In front ?
[13:09] mn021 | Yeah .
[13:11] mn021 | Mmm .
"[13:13] mn021 | You know ,"
"[13:47] mn082 | Yeah , that 's right . Yeah ."
[13:50] mn082 | Yeah .
[13:54] mn021 | nnn
"[13:55] mn021 | slow signals , or"
"[14:00] mn082 | Yeah , but nevertheless , you have the range of ten meters , or of one hundred meters ."
[14:02] mn021 | Yeah .
"[14:03] mn021 | Yeah , but you know , uh in fact"
[14:03] mn082 | OK .
"[15:27] mn021 | because Bluetooth is also intended to work in two point four uh gigabits ,"
[15:28] mn082 | Yeah .
[15:33] mn021 | you know eh Bluetooth
[15:40] mn021 | mmm
[15:55] mn021 | the idea is that
[16:23] mn021 | I don't expect any any more problem .
"[16:31] mn021 | uh , mmm ,"
"[17:12] mn082 | Well that 's a good news , OK ? But anyway , um based on your uh uh initial scenario"
[17:14] mn021 | Yeah . I think so .
"[17:20] mn082 | I believe because Bluetooth is on one chip ,"
[17:22] mn021 | Yeah .
[17:27] mn021 | Five bucks . Five bucks chip .
"[17:30] mn082 | Yeah , and and and whatever kind of of eh things connected to your laptop and also your microphone and whatever you will will have ,"
[17:34] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[17:36] mn082 | is Bluetooth - based .
"[17:37] mn082 | Yeah , or will be Bluetooth - based ."
[17:38] mn021 | Will be .
"[17:39] mn082 | Yeah , and this is this is eh within maybe an uh wireless LAN . So ,"
[17:39] mn021 | Will be .
[17:44] mn082 | despite the fact that they are considered for different scenarios they are still
[17:49] mn021 | In fact in fact Bluetooth is also designed
[17:49] mn082 | within one one area .
[17:51] mn082 | Yeah .
[18:11] mn082 | OK we 'll when I I will have some problems in the future with my l
[18:19] mn021 | I 'll try to .
"[18:25] mn021 | Uh well ,"
"[19:09] mn021 | when you have to choose among two options , well ,"
"[19:12] mn021 | mmm , maybe you are"
"[20:19] mn021 | and to include in every single node driver ,"
[20:41] mn021 | OK ?
[20:42] mn021 | Of course this idea
"[20:46] mn021 | mmm ,"
[21:00] mn082 | But maybe for cars .
"[21:02] mn082 | Yeah , if your car is the infrastructure , for instance . Yeah ."
[21:03] mn021 | Yeah .
[21:06] mn082 | OK .
"[21:07] mn021 | So ,"
[21:12] mn021 | So
[21:15] mn021 | One possible extension of the same idea
"[21:34] mn021 | mmm ,"
"[21:39] mn021 | that users could get ,"
[22:14] mn021 | And
"[23:07] mn021 | You know this something , uh I 'm putting on the table I 'm not sure about ,"
[23:26] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[23:27] mn082 | OK . many thanks Miguel . Are there any questions ?
"[23:29] mn021 | Oh , you are welcome ."
[23:31] mn082 | Maybe we have also the time to discuss with Miguel off - line the things if there is some uh question concerning uh his talk or maybe other questions .
"[23:38] mn082 | Maybe one last question from my side because I bring it up , uh concerning the proposal , some kind of active routing mechanism ."
[23:45] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[23:46] mn082 | It 's
[23:47] mn082 | going in a quite different direction as as as as the traditional things discussed in the ITF and I currently do not have any idea whether active routing is really a topic
"[23:57] mn082 | uh , within the I T F . Do you have certain kind of experience or do you know certain activities"
"[24:03] mn082 | uh , in that area ?"
"[24:05] mn021 | Nnn , no to both q to both questions ."
[24:09] mn082 | OK .
"[24:28] mn082 | I know , yeah ."
[24:38] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:45] mn082 | Oh , OK ."
"[24:46] mn082 | One more time , many thanks Miguel ."
"[24:51] mn021 | Oh , than thanks , Michael , for your computer ."
[24:54] mn035 | No problem .
[24:57] mn082 | So I will deploy a little bit information here from the uh project proposal .
[25:02] mn021 | Should I power off it ?
"[25:05] mn035 | Um , just log out ."
[25:07] mn021 | OK .
[25:08] mn035 | Uh . No . Log out .
"[25:10] mn021 | Oh , OK , sorry , sorry ."
[25:16] mn021 | Oh .
"[25:17] mn082 | Jordi is only a short period of time here , so he will get the colored one ."
[25:19] mn021 | W
[25:20] mn021 | which is i
[25:23] mn021 | Michael
[25:24] mn035 | OK .
"[25:25] mn021 | Michael ,"
[25:26] mn021 | which is the proper answer ?
[25:28] mn082 | uh
[25:29] mn035 | That 's the proper answer . Yeah .
[25:29] mn021 | Th - this one ? OK . Thank you .
"[25:35] mn082 | Uh ,"
"[25:43] mn082 | I think , first of all , Wilbert , is not here , second um , the um"
[26:00] mn082 | yesterday night .
[26:01] mn082 | So I suggest we go roughly to the slides here
[26:05] mn082 | and
[26:07] mn082 | um
"[26:09] mn082 | The the problem is that , in principle , we have"
[26:12] mn082 | different scopes .
[26:13] mn082 | And motivation of the project proposal from my point of view
[26:17] mn082 | is that we will have
[26:19] mn082 | the
[26:20] mn082 | um
[26:22] mn082 | Wireless access networks for the next generation
[26:30] mn082 | changes within this network .
[26:46] mn082 | and um
[26:48] mn082 | and um also
"[26:51] mn082 | based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain , that it is possible to to uh"
[26:58] mn082 | use novel things and and and new protocols and new technologies within this network .
"[27:03] mn082 | On the other hand , in the internet backbone ,"
[27:06] mn082 | it is i impossible
"[27:08] mn082 | and we see it on several examples like this , MPLS , there 's quality of service support , and multicast and all this kind of thing ,"
"[27:15] mn082 | that , based on the success of the internet backbone , it 's"
[27:19] mn082 | become
"[27:20] mn082 | uh very unflexible ,"
[27:21] mn082 | to p uh fo for the provision of these things .
"[27:25] mn082 | So ,"
"[27:26] mn082 | if we are going to offer building blocks ,"
"[27:29] mn082 | and provide novel solutions for the next generation of wireless access networks ,"
"[27:34] mn082 | taking into account , without modifying the end - to - end scope ,"
"[27:39] mn082 | then I think it 's really beneficial work , also for the"
"[27:42] mn082 | use of interactive multimedia application , so as it is described in the"
[27:47] mn082 | uh project proposal .
[27:49] mn082 | Um the point is
[27:51] mn082 | that
[28:00] mn082 | a bigger cluster of
"[28:02] mn082 | co uh of potential partners to do this really really really big work ,"
[28:07] mn082 | seems not to be feasible in the next time .
"[28:10] mn082 | because if you have settled everything , and discussed everything and and and and uh without any money in the background , and a lot of money in the background ,"
"[28:19] mn082 | that is not uh feasible from my point of view . Nevertheless , I discussed , with a lot of partners , these things ."
"[28:25] mn082 | And today , uh Michael and me , we were on the UCB to discuss with a guy who is"
[28:32] mn082 | a professor who is probably interested in the application stuff . They are
"[28:40] mn082 | NSF , um , f for this"
"[28:43] mn082 | "" intelligent classroom "" , is a little bit exaggerated , I believe , but going in that direction ."
"[28:48] mn082 | So there are a lot of interest , but without really hard money in the background , it is very hard to come to the initial steps ."
"[28:55] mn082 | And uh Juan Peire , one of the"
"[29:02] mn082 | identified a certain kind of s start money , I would like to say . So maybe if you start with a small cluster of"
[29:09] mn082 | um
"[29:10] mn082 | the constraints of this funding , and that means uh six universities and and institutions uh , three in USA and three in Europe ."
"[29:19] mn082 | and of course , they are"
[29:21] mn082 | uh including the NSA group
"[29:24] mn082 | and maybe that seems to be very reasonably , for me ."
[29:26] mn082 | But then we have to align the project proposal in that sense .
[29:29] mn082 | Because then we cannot do do anything as it is described in the in the bigger scope .
[29:34] mn082 | So the point is um to
[29:38] mn082 | reduce
[29:39] mn082 | the
"[29:40] mn082 | overall picture , which I described in a few words ,"
"[29:43] mn082 | to the fact that we have really some work packages where we can focus on it ,"
[29:47] mn082 | still fitting into the big picture .
[29:50] mn082 | Yeah ?
[29:51] mn082 | And so that will be the task of the next weeks .
[29:55] mn082 | I hope that everybody is doing his homework concerning @ @ for instance
[30:00] mn082 | uh alternative to the intelligent classroom
[30:03] mn082 | maybe that we h can start here only with the N S A group
[30:08] mn082 | within this big picture
[30:10] mn082 | um with some work
"[30:21] mn082 | joining people of the NSA group , to do some work here ."
[30:24] mn082 | And if we are starting with a very very very small cluster with a common activity
[30:29] mn082 | have maybe some
[30:30] mn082 | starting funding for
[30:34] mn082 | bigger
"[30:35] mn082 | uh radius of the of the the the uh project proposal , with the mind that maybe at the final stage it will becoming a European proposal with this"
"[30:43] mn082 | uh the the whole funding . That 's uh my point , and my picture I have in mind ."
[30:49] mn082 | And I will go definitely back to Germany the tenth of December . That is fixed now .
[31:00] mn082 | uh for the proposal in that sense what I mentioned before .
[31:02] mn021 | Hmm - hmm .
"[31:03] mn082 | Because then I will make the advertising that is still worth to stay here ,"
[31:12] mn082 | mid of end of January . So
[31:16] mn082 | that 's
[31:17] mn082 | uh
[31:18] mn082 | it 's a comment to the
[31:20] mn082 | proposal .
[31:22] mn082 | So I think
"[31:23] mn082 | everybody should consider carefully , based on this statement I made uh next steps"
[31:28] mn082 | and
[31:29] mn082 | of course
[31:30] mn082 | everybody has little bit other work to do
[31:33] mn082 | but it should be should be always an ongoing process until I will leave until the tenth of December .
[31:39] mn030 | You mentioned um six partners of this um work . So you know already
[31:39] mn082 | OK .
[31:47] mn030 | what partners
[31:48] mn030 | are included . OK I didn't have a look at uh
[31:52] mn082 | I will distribute all the things electronically
[31:55] mn030 | OK .
"[31:56] mn082 | OK , take a look to slide of number two ,"
[32:00] mn082 | Yeah !
"[32:01] mn082 | You see uh uh University of Mannheim , University"
"[32:05] mn082 | also these are the official ones ,"
"[32:06] mn030 | Yeah , sure ."
"[32:08] mn082 | You see that in the ICSI US on the U S A side , I believe that the home companies and universities are still contributing ."
[32:12] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[32:16] mn030 | Yeah yeah .
[32:16] mn082 | Yeah ?
[32:22] mn082 | They say they are very interested in it . Yeah ?
[32:23] mn030 | OK .
"[32:24] mn082 | Uh a few words , the University of Mannheim is at location where Joerg Widmer is uh working on it , and I got the"
[32:31] mn082 | statement
[32:32] mn082 | uh they are very interested in that . They did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom but nevertheless they did a lot
"[32:39] mn082 | in networking stuff . And University of Uppsala , Sweden ,"
"[32:43] mn082 | that 's the reason I invited uh Christian Tschudin , the professor who did"
[32:47] mn082 | ten years work in in active routing .
[32:50] mn082 | And uh OK the
[32:52] mn082 | Universidad Nacional de Educat -
[32:54] mn082 | Yeah .
[32:58] mn021 | Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia
"[33:02] mn082 | in Spain ,"
[33:03] mn082 | uh this is this university of Juan Peire .
[33:04] mn021 | Yeah .
[33:06] mn082 | And he is also the one who had recognized uh
[33:09] mn040 | Who is ?
[33:10] mn082 | one
[33:10] mn082 | pair
[33:11] mn082 | pair
[33:12] mn040 | Perez .
"[33:13] mn082 | Not Parez , Peire ."
[33:17] mn035 | Paez . Paez .
"[33:17] mn021 | Paez , Paez"
"[33:18] mn040 | Ah , Peire ."
"[33:18] mn082 | No , no , no . Not not Paez . Not ."
"[33:20] mn082 | Peire , P E I R E ."
[33:24] mn082 | You never heard from him ?
[33:26] mn040 | No .
[33:27] mn040 | I don't know .
"[33:27] mn082 | You can I you can mail him later on the informa Then , of course , the whole N S A group and also of the coordinator of all the things ,"
[33:28] mn040 | I don't know who he is . OK .
"[33:35] mn082 | then Georgia Tech , I have good relationship to uh the long lasting uh cooperation with Georgia Tech"
"[33:41] mn082 | and they did a lot in this area , also related to networking stuff as well as to the intelligent classroom stuff and the UCB . We still"
[33:49] mn082 | focusing on maybe we can have
[33:52] mn082 | uh
"[33:53] mn082 | more professors involved which are working also on the networking stuff as well as on the application stuff , so that the UCB is"
[34:00] mn082 | clustered as one
[34:02] mn082 | uh partner but nevertheless with different departments .
[34:04] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[34:05] mn082 | Yeah .
"[34:07] mn082 | But take a look to the slides , I will uh deploy it um"
[34:12] mn021 | Wher - where your slides are available ?
[34:12] mn082 | uh electronically .
[34:14] mn082 | Sorry ?
[34:15] mn021 | Wher - where the slides are available ?
[34:16] mn082 | I will send it electronically .
[34:18] mn021 | When ?
[34:19] mn082 | After the meeting .
[34:20] mn021 | Ah !
[34:22] mn082 | I will . Future .
[34:24] mn021 | Sorry .
"[34:25] mn082 | And , maybe you take a look to the uh last two slides , um"
"[34:31] mn082 | Um , maybe the GPRS picture is still uh available . So you have , in principle , here now the"
[34:37] mn082 | mapping
"[34:38] mn082 | of the different areas , um within GPS , and , in principle , the same applies for UMTS . There is no so much different ."
[34:47] mn082 | Um .
"[34:48] mn082 | You always have the SGSN and UMTS , they are called three - GSGSN ."
[34:53] mn082 | And you have the protocol stack
"[34:55] mn082 | um in on the slide number five ,"
[34:58] mn082 | to see what
[34:59] mn082 | uh is going on . And you see the difference . The amazing thing is that you have IP over IP .
"[35:06] mn082 | As you take a look to the the uh GGSN , you have two - IP layer functionality and and all those things . And you have the"
[35:19] mn082 | And and so on . So uh I believe they are very very difficult protocols stuck between the uh between the
[35:25] mn082 | um
"[35:29] mn082 | making it necessary , in principle , to deal with our four building blocks"
"[35:37] mn082 | yeah , I believe , in a difficult way ,"
"[35:39] mn082 | if , uh , we have in mind quality of service routing , and and uh qualit uh mobility aspects and and all this kinds of things for I P layer functionality ."
"[35:50] mn082 | So that 's , in principle , uh an overview ,"
"[35:52] mn082 | of the protocol stack and the involved nodes , and I will provide more and more information but um eh I have to also figure out"
[36:00] mn082 | everything from the scratch . I am not a total expert for for the
[36:04] mn082 | future wireless networks .
[36:08] mn082 | OK .
[36:09] mn082 | Then I would like to thanks everybody
[36:20] mn082 | I would like to start with reading uh these numbers .
"[37:13] mn082 | OK , please the next one ."
"[40:13] mn082 | OK , thank you Now , please let don't switch off power , I have to call Adam , so"
"[41:48] mn082 | So I suggest , @ @ now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break , tea , cake , whatever , @ @ will will be offered ,"
[41:56] mn082 | and then we will have a we can have a discussion .

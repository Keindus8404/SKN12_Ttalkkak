[00:00] me001 | If you 're popular .
[00:00] me018 | One two three four five six I 'm on seven .
[00:00] me011 | We 're on .
"[00:03] me011 | So , I think we pre - crashed , so I think we 're OK ."
[00:05] fe008 | Pre - crashed .
"[00:06] me011 | So it should be a really short meeting , I hope ."
"[00:07] me011 | Uh , agenda items , number one , I wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues . What the heck are we gonna do about microphones ?"
[00:16] me011 | So uh I got passed on that the EDU group doesn't like the
[00:20] fe008 | Oh .
"[00:20] me011 | uh , Crown mikes . I do . I l I think I find them very comfortable . Uh , but it seems to depend on your head shape ."
[00:22] fe008 | I do .
"[00:24] fe008 | Yeah , I do too ."
[00:27] me018 | So you guys need to start going to the EDU meetings .
[00:28] mn017 | I see .
[00:29] mn017 | They don't work for me very well . I much prefer these .
[00:29] me011 | That 's right .
[00:29] me001 | Yeah right .
"[00:32] me011 | Yep . Um ,"
[00:32] mn014 | Yeah .
[00:33] me001 | Me too .
[00:33] mn014 | So do I .
"[00:34] me018 | I prefer these , but I don't mind using those ."
[00:36] me011 | Right .
[00:36] me001 | Th - those are intimidating .
[00:37] me011 | So apparently they they like
"[00:40] me011 | It has one good effect , that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike ."
[00:45] fe008 | Interesting .
"[00:46] me011 | People who show up late have to use these . So ,"
"[00:49] me011 | um , we should probably get different mikes . So the question is , the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more , um ,"
[00:55] me011 | Sony mikes .
"[00:56] me011 | Just two more of those , um . And that that 's easy and that will certainly work ."
[01:00] me011 | The other option is to try yet another mike .
"[01:03] me011 | Find one we like and potentially get six , all the same ."
[01:06] fe008 | I have a question about this .
"[01:08] fe008 | Are the auditory quality Is it , uh , much different between this kind and the the fancy ones ?"
"[01:14] me011 | Um , these are better , if they 're worn correctly ."
[01:15] fe008 | They are .
[01:17] me018 | Those are better than the Sonys ?
[01:17] fe008 | OK .
[01:18] me011 | Yeah .
"[01:19] me011 | Yeah , definitely ."
[01:19] mn014 | Have you listened to to them ?
[01:20] me011 | Yeah .
[01:20] mn014 | Yeah ?
[01:21] me011 | Yeah .
[01:21] mn014 | OK .
"[01:22] me011 | So , I mean , they 're not a lot better , but they are a little better ."
"[01:27] me011 | Um , they 're more directional , a little better error uh , noise cancellation , and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth , like this , whereas that one , to avoid breath noise , you really have to put it at to the side ."
[01:32] me001 | OK .
[01:37] me011 | So you seem to get better signal with this one .
[01:45] mn017 | L Liz Liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them .
[01:52] mn017 | They are ver
"[01:52] fe008 | Gosh , cuz I much prefer them , I think they 're a whole lot , multiple levels , better ."
[01:58] fe008 | It seems a shame t to discard discard them if if they 're better auditory quality and there 're only a few people who dis who object .
"[01:58] me011 | I mean , so s"
[02:00] mn017 | Right .
"[02:04] me018 | Yeah , that 's why I was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in ."
"[02:06] me011 | Well , I mean , that 's the other option , is that we could switch the form so it 's more obvious the distinction between channel and mike , um , and then get"
[02:16] mn017 | Hmm .
[02:20] me011 | Should we get just more Sony ones ? I hate the Sony ones .
[02:23] me001 | Which ones are those ?
[02:24] me001 | The one I 'm wearing ? Oh .
[02:25] mn014 | Those .
[02:26] me001 | Oh .
[02:26] me011 | pinches the temples too much .
"[02:28] me011 | I mean , so , if you wear it sort of around the back , it 's not too bad ."
[02:30] mn014 | Yeah .
[02:31] me001 | Yeah .
"[02:31] fe008 | I hate it because it 's hard to adjust the microphone . I mean , I spend all this time fumbling around with it and still not"
[02:33] me011 | Right .
"[02:37] fe008 | reasonable , yeah ."
[02:37] me011 | Right .
"[02:39] me011 | So , I mean , we could try another mike ."
"[02:40] me011 | But then we have the wiring issue , and So I I don't know what to do . What do what do people think ?"
[02:46] mn014 | Wh -
"[02:47] me011 | The plug is proprietary . So that 's why I was saying getting more Sony ones is trivial , because we can just go out and buy them . Any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired ."
[02:48] mn014 | OK .
[02:48] mn014 | OK .
[02:51] mn014 | OK .
[02:53] mn014 | Yeah .
[03:06] me011 | Yes .
"[03:06] me011 | So , the only possibilities from Sony are that one and the lapel mike ."
[03:06] fe008 | I see . OK .
[03:09] fe008 | OK .
"[03:11] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
[03:11] me011 | So this isn't Sony . This is Crown . The one we 're wearing .
[03:13] fe008 | Isn't that something . OK .
[03:15] me011 | And so we had these wired for us .
[03:17] fe008 | Oh . I see . OK .
"[03:18] fe008 | Huh , I remember that now ."
"[03:23] me011 | I think that 's probably the right first step is just get two more immediately , and have them available ."
[03:25] me018 | Yeah .
[03:26] fe008 | OK .
[03:30] me011 | Right .
[03:30] me018 | transmitter .
"[03:30] me011 | And just make sure that you write down "" Crown "" or "" Sony "" on the mike number , which I 'll change to mike type , or something like that ."
[03:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[03:37] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[03:38] mn014 | Yeah .
"[03:40] fe008 | It might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too , cuz that would be an easy place for , uh , an error in the data ."
[03:45] me011 | Yep .
[03:46] fe008 | For it to be forgotten .
"[03:49] me011 | It 'll be whoever 's setting up the meeting , who fills out the key file , so"
[03:53] me011 | It has the same potential for error as everything else .
"[03:59] me011 | No , no , we definitely would not have the user fill it out . It would be me , Chuck , or Liz , depending on which meeting it is ."
"[04:01] fe008 | Good , OK ."
[04:03] fe008 | Perfect .
"[04:04] fe008 | Perfect , OK ."
"[04:04] me011 | OK , so we 'll de definitely go ahead and do that ."
[04:06] me018 | How much is it just to buy the mike ?
[04:08] me011 | Couple hundred .
[04:09] me018 | Really .
[04:09] me011 | Yeah .
[04:11] fe008 | Is that more or less than you thought ?
[04:11] me011 | It depends on how good the mike is .
[04:12] me018 | Oh that 's way more than I thought . I yeah .
[04:14] mn014 | Yeah .
"[04:14] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
[04:14] me001 | For one of these ?
[04:15] me011 | Well the Crown ones were like two - fifty . I think those are like one - ninety .
[04:20] me001 | God .
[04:21] me018 | Wow !
[04:22] me011 | But .
[04:27] mn014 | Student discount .
"[04:29] me011 | Yeah , good mikes are expensive . So ."
"[04:30] me018 | And when I was at Computer Motion we used Shure , the SM - ten - A 's , and I think they were only like eighty bucks or something ."
[04:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:37] me011 | Yeah , eighty or ninety for the Shures . So ."
[04:38] me018 | Yeah . But they were they seemed pretty good .
"[04:40] me011 | I mean , the Sony ones are expensive because they 're proprietary , so they can charge whatever they want . These are expensive because they 're quite high quality . So ."
[04:43] me018 | Oh .
"[04:46] me018 | Right , right ."
[04:48] me011 | So we should buzz that out if we send the data to Sony .
"[04:52] mn017 | Ah , come on ."
"[04:56] me011 | Well , I 'm just joking ."
"[04:57] me011 | So , you do not have to bleep that out . I don't mind if Sony knows my opinion . So ."
[05:03] mn017 | Hmm .
[05:04] me011 | Um .
"[05:05] me011 | Also , we 're pro I wanna double check with Morgan , he did say yes before I went to Japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless , instead of the mix of wired and wireless . And I think that 's the right thing to do ."
[05:17] me018 | So then all those red channels there would become wireless ones ?
[05:17] mn014 | Yeah .
[05:21] me011 | Yep .
[05:21] me018 | Cool .
[05:22] me011 | Yep .
[05:23] me001 | Uh - huh .
[05:23] me011 | Four more wireless .
[05:25] me011 | Um .
"[05:26] me011 | And also I 'm gonna re probably replace the Andrea mike with a Shure , but I 'll test it , uh , sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the Shure one really works , cuz I have an extra Shure in my office ."
[05:37] me018 | The Andrea mike ?
[05:38] mn014 | Yeah .
"[05:38] me011 | Yeah , apparently it 's had some problems ."
"[05:39] mn014 | That 's causing problems , yeah ."
[05:40] me018 | Which one is the Andrea mike ?
[05:41] fe008 | It was over here sometimes .
[05:43] me018 | A wired one ?
[05:43] mn014 | The yeah a wired one .
"[05:44] me018 | Well , if you 're gonna go to all wireless ,"
"[05:46] me018 | Oh , you mean in the meantime ."
[05:46] me011 | This one .
"[05:48] me018 | Ah , I see ."
[05:48] mn014 | Yeah .
[05:50] me011 | it 'll it 'll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from Sony anyway .
[05:53] me018 | Yeah .
[05:54] me018 | I haven't In the meetings that I recorded s
[05:59] me011 | Oh really ? Yeah .
[06:00] me018 | Recently I haven't had to used any of the wired ones at all .
"[06:01] me011 | I guess cuz everyone 's been out of town . Probably over the summer it 'll be the same cuz it tends to be less ,"
[06:03] me018 | Yeah .
[06:07] me011 | fewer people .
"[06:08] me011 | Um ,"
"[06:11] me011 | Uh , done with microphone issues , I think ?"
[06:13] fe008 | Should we close the door ?
[06:14] me011 | If you want .
"[06:15] fe008 | Oh , I 'm thinking I don't know about the acoustics . That 's that 's all I was wondering about ."
[06:19] me011 | And this way we can get a door - slam in the uh in the transcript file .
[06:25] me011 | Oh well . No - not quite a slam .
[06:28] me018 | There 's some knocks .
[06:31] mn017 | Get a special phone for that .
[06:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:33] me011 | Uh , the door - slam phone ?"
[06:34] mn017 | Yeah .
[06:35] me018 | You have a special phone ?
"[06:36] mn017 | No , we could add one ."
"[06:36] me018 | Oh , we could add one , yeah ."
"[06:37] me011 | And then we could have the phone phone ,"
[06:37] mn017 | Yeah .
[06:39] me011 | for for when the phone rings .
"[06:42] me011 | Um ,"
"[06:45] me011 | Uh , file reorganization ."
"[06:46] me011 | This is something we were talking about before I left and saying we should probably wait until after I 'm back , and now I 'm back , so , we should do that at some point . So we should"
[06:54] me011 | get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else .
[06:58] mn017 | Can I can I just mention something ?
[07:00] me011 | Sure .
"[07:01] mn017 | Um , uh , I think the file regards reorganization . Also , um , another issue there is disk space probably , right ? Um , so"
[07:07] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[07:10] mn017 | I know that the files that you 've been cutting up for us
"[07:14] mn017 | f for the recognition experiments , uh , one way one really"
[07:15] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:19] mn017 | uh , brain - dead way of of of"
"[07:22] mn017 | not causing any trouble , but saving disk space is to , uh , use the s the"
"[07:28] mn017 | Sphere , the NIST , uh , W - encode program ."
"[07:31] mn017 | to to encode , you know , to compress them ."
[07:35] me011 | Shorten . Is that the same as shorten ?
"[07:35] mn017 | Uh , yeah , but it does it s it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently ."
[07:36] me001 | Yeah .
"[07:45] me011 | Well , OK , you mean it 's built into the SRI , because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools ."
[07:51] me011 | So .
"[07:51] mn017 | Y uh , I guess , but it"
"[07:54] mn017 | um ,"
[07:56] me011 | So it 's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools .
"[08:01] mn017 | It 's actually built into the Sphere library that NIST delivers , so Right ."
[08:05] me011 | Oh really ? I didn't know that .
"[08:07] mn017 | And actually , s the sound tools don't understand that ."
[08:10] me018 | At least Feacalc doesn't .
[08:11] mn017 | At least Feacalc doesn't . So .
"[08:13] me011 | Well , that 's not a sound tool , right ."
"[08:14] mn017 | But since since these files are made to be used with the SRI recognizer ,"
[08:19] mn017 | uh and the SRI front - end uses the Sphere library which in turn does this
[08:23] mn017 | transparently
"[08:24] mn017 | um ,"
[08:28] me001 | Yeah .
[08:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[08:32] me001 | The other thing I could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything
"[08:37] me001 | to my eighteen gig disk , which is local ."
"[08:40] me001 | Well ,"
"[08:41] mn017 | I mean , you should do that too ,"
"[08:43] me001 | Yeah , it is kind of a temporary solution ."
[08:47] me001 | To shorten everything .
"[08:56] mn017 | The way I recently used it , and there might be better ways So the program 's called W - encode ."
[09:01] me001 | Mmm .
"[09:02] mn017 | And I think the type , y you say um"
"[09:08] mn017 | different encoding methods , but if you wanna use the shorten one , you say d "" minus T shorten "" ,"
[09:13] mn017 | and then the old
[09:15] mn017 | uh wavefile and the new
"[09:25] mn017 | the shell "" AND "" operator or something ."
[09:28] mn017 | Then I just move the
"[09:31] mn017 | new wavefile to the ,"
"[09:34] mn017 | you know , to the old"
[09:36] me011 | Right .
"[09:36] mn017 | wavefile , and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to"
[09:41] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[09:44] mn017 | decode it on the fly .
[09:47] me001 | OK .
"[09:48] mn017 | that just saved my butt because I actually was running On a different experiment , I had"
"[09:54] mn017 | I was processing the whole Switchboard - two corpus , which is two hundred eighty hours of speech ,"
"[09:59] mn017 | and I was noticing , as I was"
[10:05] mn017 | And and so
[10:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[10:16] me011 | You had another process running that was shortening it . Yep .
"[10:18] fe008 | Wow , wow !"
[10:22] me018 | Wow !
"[10:23] me011 | Did you have to re - nice one of the processes to make sure that "" shorten "" ?"
[10:29] fe008 | Wow .
[10:43] me018 | It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around . What would be easier would be like pointers .
"[10:49] me011 | The list , yep ."
"[10:50] me018 | You know , lists like "" original wavefile , start , end "" ."
[10:52] me011 | Start end .
"[10:54] me011 | Yep , the way Feacalc calc does it ."
[11:03] mn017 | go into a l a longer file with indices .
"[11:06] mn017 | Um , so I I suppose"
[11:13] me011 | It would be easy .
[11:14] me011 | It wouldn't be hard at all . Someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time .
[11:19] mn017 | So .
[11:23] me011 | And that way we wouldn't have multiple versions floating around . About the only difficulty with that is if it 's compressed .
[11:30] me011 | Then you really do have to decompress it first .
[11:33] mn017 | That 's true .
[11:35] me011 | Y you don't know how much it 's comp
[11:36] me011 | It doesn't compress it by a fixed amount .
[11:36] mn017 | Exactly . Right right right right right .
"[11:37] me018 | Well , is there is there is there a NIST routine which"
[11:41] me018 | can seek
[11:42] me018 | in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices ?
[11:45] mn017 | I don't think so .
[11:58] me018 | Right .
[11:58] mn017 | that extra copy . So .
"[11:58] me018 | Right we I mean the original Switchboard files are not compressed , right ? So we could leave those as they are ."
[11:59] mn014 | Yeah .
[12:01] mn017 | Right .
"[12:03] me011 | Well , I mean , it just depends on how much disk space is a problem . I mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it ."
[12:03] mn017 | Right .
[12:11] me011 | But .
"[12:12] mn017 | I mean , the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions ."
"[12:16] mn014 | Just silences , yeah ."
[12:17] me011 | That 's true .
[12:18] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:19] me018 | Well , assuming you 'd Yeah . Assuming that you then off - load the original"
[12:23] mn017 | Yeah .
[12:23] me018 | Switchboard files .
[12:25] mn017 | So .
[12:26] me001 | Mmm .
[12:26] me011 | Yeah .
"[12:27] me011 | Well , it seems like just shortening them is a good short - term solution so we don't have to do any coding ."
"[12:29] me018 | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:31] mn017 | Yeah .
[12:32] me011 | So .
[12:37] me001 | Oh was that the day you left ?
[12:39] me001 | That 's suspicious .
[12:40] me018 | He did it on purpose .
[12:40] me001 | Yeah .
[12:41] me001 | Leave to Japan the day the disk crashes .
"[12:47] me001 | But , um Yeah so , Chuck helped me out in , uh , r"
[12:52] me001 | regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings for like six meetings . So I think they 're split up even further . It 's kind of even more disorganized now since
[12:55] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[13:00] me001 | we moved some of the meetings to different directories .
"[13:03] me001 | They 're on a different disk even , right ?"
[13:05] me001 | I think you didn't you expand them to XE on Abbott ?
[13:05] me018 | Are they ?
[13:08] fe008 | XF .
"[13:09] me001 | No , you the ones that"
"[13:10] fe008 | Oh , different ones ?"
[13:11] me001 | You the ones that you put them on when you put them on XE .
[13:13] me018 | I don't remember where I put them now .
[13:15] me001 | I think you put them on XE . So .
[13:16] me018 | OK .
[13:16] fe008 | Well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed
"[13:20] fe008 | was it w with a with a meta disk allocation , you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on XE were on the same sorry , different partitions of the same physical disk ."
[13:29] me018 | Physical disk .
[13:31] me001 | Mmm .
"[13:32] fe008 | And it 's conceivable I mean , I I don't I mean , so um , I was told that it 's possible that that might have , uh , caused additional wear on it . Maybe caused it to to go bad sooner ."
[13:42] me001 | Hmm .
"[13:42] me011 | Well , I think there was something else going on , because uh Dave Johnson said that DD was getting accessed frequently . And it shouldn't be ."
[13:47] fe008 | Oh . Uh - huh .
"[13:49] me011 | Right ? That data never gets touched , because we write it once and then we never touch it again ."
"[13:50] fe008 | Well , why not ?"
[13:51] fe008 | Oh sure it does .
"[13:55] fe008 | Well , I mean , so the wavefiles , or or anything at all , because the transcripts are there as well ."
[13:57] me011 | The wave files .
"[13:58] me011 | I mean , he was saying gigabytes ."
"[14:00] fe008 | Oh , gigabytes . I see ."
"[14:00] me011 | And so , it has to be the wave files ."
"[14:02] me018 | Yeah , there was something weird about that ."
"[14:02] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
"[14:03] me011 | Yeah , so I asked Dave about it and he hasn't looked into it yet , but we should definitely double check on it ."
[14:07] me018 | Yeah like like the same
"[14:09] me018 | meeting shortened , files that we pull off of Popcorn when we 're done doing the recording ,"
[14:13] fe008 | Yeah .
"[14:13] me018 | looked ,"
"[14:15] me018 | to the backup software , as if they had been written ,"
"[14:17] me018 | you know , every single night ,"
[14:18] me011 | Every night .
[14:19] fe008 | Is that right .
"[14:20] me018 | i for f you know , a week in a row , which is really weird ."
[14:21] fe008 | That 's very strange . I didn't realize that . OK .
[14:22] me001 | Wow .
"[14:25] me011 | So at any rate , so for file reorganization we need to first decide what we 're gonna do and then when we 're gonna do it ."
[14:31] me018 | Yeah .
"[14:31] me011 | So I 'm not sure who isn't involved with that . I mean , certainly me , Chuck and Jane . Anyone else care ?"
[14:40] mn017 | No .
"[14:40] fe008 | And I and I 'd like , in terms of the conventions , to also , uh , you know , s send a bit to Dan Ellis to see if it 's if there 's any get his input on it . I don't think I don't think that 'll be Yeah ."
[14:48] me011 | Right .
"[14:50] me011 | So , maybe we should do that"
[14:52] fe008 | Yeah .
"[14:52] me011 | not during this meeting but s another time , and just get a list of everything we 're gonna do ."
[14:53] me018 | Yeah .
[14:54] fe008 | Yeah .
[14:55] me018 | Yeah .
[14:56] me018 | Maybe n next week if we could . I 'm trying to finish up some stuff .
[14:58] me011 | OK .
[15:01] me011 | So just update all the naming conventions and
"[15:04] me011 | put all the files where they really belong , on one disk ,"
[15:06] me018 | That sounds like a good idea .
[15:07] me011 | and then leave leave everything in place until the back - up until the next full back - up and then delete the old ones .
[15:12] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[15:14] me011 | So .
"[15:20] me011 | Well , both need to be reorganized ."
[15:22] fe008 | OK .
"[15:23] me011 | So um ,"
"[15:25] me011 | various paths , th I mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way , because um"
"[15:29] me018 | I think we should also at the same time try to , uh , convert over to your new naming conventions ."
"[15:33] me011 | Yes ,"
[15:34] me011 | exactly . That too .
[15:34] me018 | That 'd be good .
[15:36] me011 | So that 's what I was saying . We need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do .
[15:37] me018 | Yeah .
[15:39] fe008 | OK .
[15:39] me011 | And so
"[15:41] me011 | I didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that I sent out , so I assume that 's alright with everyone ."
[15:47] me011 | Oh .
[15:47] me001 | No .
"[15:50] mn017 | Uh , I don't know about the naming , I mean ,"
[15:50] me011 | OK .
[15:51] me011 | Then I should have made that as an agenda item .
[15:54] mn017 | Th - so these names that we 've been using so far are with uh
[15:57] mn017 | uh
[15:59] mn017 | uh
[16:00] mn017 | I wouldn't just wanna change them
"[16:03] mn017 | you know , without some advance notice ."
[16:05] me011 | Right .
"[16:06] mn017 | I mean , th that 's all these segment names that we we 've been using . I would rather not mess with them"
[16:08] me001 | Yeah .
[16:11] mn017 | until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently
[16:14] me001 | Right .
"[16:15] me011 | Well , I mean , how you choose to do it the naming is up to you ."
"[16:18] me001 | Well ,"
[16:18] mn017 | Right .
[16:18] me011 | So .
[16:19] fe008 | You 're talking about different files .
"[16:19] me001 | I mean , it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what you 're doing but ,"
[16:22] me011 | Yep .
"[16:32] me018 | If we change things , it won't really affect what you 're doing , will it ?"
[16:38] me011 | Right .
"[16:38] me018 | Yeah . So you but you can switch that any time you want , right ?"
"[16:40] me001 | Yeah . Yeah . I mean , it 's only gonna affect my work . So ."
"[16:56] me001 | Yeah , that 'd be great ."
[16:59] me001 | Really enjoy that .
[17:01] fe008 | With no with no advance warning .
"[17:03] me011 | Well , maybe I shouldn't say that on re record ."
[17:06] fe008 | OK .
[17:07] me011 | There was a
"[17:08] me011 | typo in some of the contracts that Morgan got that someone ,"
"[17:12] me011 | one of our sponsors , did a global sear search and replace for between "" sponsor "" and their name ."
[17:18] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[17:24] me011 | I 'm not sure whether that 's right .
"[17:25] me011 | Yeah , one can imagine the problems that that would engender ."
"[17:29] fe008 | But this this name change affects a subset , doesn't need to reflect everything , yeah ."
[17:30] me011 | So .
[17:33] me001 | Right .
[17:33] me011 | Right .
"[17:35] me011 | Um ,"
"[17:38] mn014 | Yeah , I had one one short point . I have just installed a Transcriber version on one of our NT machines so it 's available under Windows now ."
[17:47] mn017 | Oh great . Actually someone I just got an email this week from someone as
[17:48] fe008 | Isn't that great ?
"[17:50] mn014 | Yeah I re responded to sh I have already responded to him . I I don't know what what what he what the problem was . It was really straightforward , really easy ."
[17:53] mn017 | To Anant ?
[17:58] fe008 | And this is not Mm - hmm .
"[17:58] mn017 | Oh , I 'm sorry , I I just So , who did you talk to ?"
[18:01] mn014 | There was some some guy from SRI who wanted to to install Yeah .
[18:03] mn017 | Anant ?
[18:04] mn017 | Anant Venkataraman ? OK .
[18:05] mn014 | Yeah .
"[18:07] mn017 | Yeah , OK . Great ."
"[18:09] mn017 | Yeah , OK ."
[18:10] mn017 | Great . Great . Thanks . Thanks .
"[18:13] fe008 | And this is not just the Transcriber , this is the Channeltrans , right ?"
[18:16] mn017 | Yeah .
"[18:16] fe008 | Yeah , excellent ."
[18:18] mn014 | the
[18:18] mn017 | Cool .
[18:20] fe008 | Excellent .
[18:20] me011 | So you should probably talk to a Sys Admin and get it put in some central place .
[18:25] me011 | So that it 'll work on all the NT machines .
"[18:26] fe008 | Well , I mean , as it stands , I I guess yeah I see what you mean . It 'll it 'll be on the on the UNIX side but accessible through the H - drive . Yeah ."
[18:27] mn014 | OK .
[18:32] me011 | Right .
[18:33] mn014 | OK . Yeah . I could do that .
"[18:36] me011 | So I assume Tcl - TK wasn't already on the machine , so you had to install it . Yeah ."
"[18:40] mn014 | I had i to install it , yeah ."
[18:43] fe008 | Huh . Yeah .
[18:43] mn017 | Uh
"[18:44] me018 | So Andreas , would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going ?"
"[18:49] mn017 | Oh , well , yeah I I I actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it , because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings , but"
[18:53] me011 | Hmm .
[19:00] mn017 | um some recognition experiments with ICSI front - end .
[19:04] mn017 | Um
"[19:05] mn017 | Uh , and and you know , this is the j joint work with Chuck , and uh ,"
[19:09] mn017 | um .
"[19:10] mn017 | So , first ,"
[19:14] mn017 | we figured out sometime last week how to
[19:18] mn017 | and and Chuck wrote this really nice little
[19:20] mn017 | script Perl script that
"[19:22] mn017 | takes a uh waveform , runs the feature calculation"
[19:26] mn017 | and then dumps it out into the into um
[19:29] mn017 | a f c so - called
"[19:31] mn017 | uh cepstra file , which is what the SRI system uses to read features . It 's essentially uh"
[19:37] mn017 | uh NIST headered
"[19:39] mn017 | uh waveform . You know , it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header ."
[19:44] me001 | Hmm .
[19:44] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[19:46] mn017 | And um that 's all done
[19:48] mn017 | um
"[19:49] mn017 | by the script , and it works great . And"
[19:52] mn017 | uh I first trained up two
"[19:55] mn017 | systems , because it 's gender - dep you know , the SRI system is gender - dependent so to be comparable , I trained uh um on a sh on a so - called short training set"
[20:03] mn017 | um
"[20:04] mn017 | a male system and a female system ,"
[20:06] mn017 | and
"[20:13] mn017 | trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the SRI front - end from scratch ,"
"[20:22] me011 | So , w what features did you use ?"
"[20:27] me011 | So not RASTA , just PLP ."
[20:29] me018 | Just PLP .
"[20:29] mn017 | Just PLP and actually that uh , one of the questions I had was what the RASTA would possibly buy us . But um , we 'll"
"[20:35] mn017 | talk about that later . So , the uh so the baseline system w the SRI system was uh used uh also uh uh used t twelve uh mel uh mel cepstra"
[20:47] mn017 | um based on a twenty - four filter bank
[20:51] mn017 | um analysis .
[20:53] mn017 | Um
[20:54] mn017 | I do not
[20:56] mn017 | know what So the f the bandwidth of the um
[21:01] mn017 | SRI front - end is from hundreds hertz to th th thirty - se thirty - seven fifty or something like that .
[21:05] me018 | Thirty - seven fifty .
[21:08] mn017 | And I do not know what the um
[21:12] mn017 | ICSI um
"[21:14] mn017 | front - end would do . I mean , what the bandwidth is ."
"[21:18] mn017 | Um ,"
"[21:24] me018 | There 's one other slight difference , right ? Or two two differences ."
[21:27] mn017 | Oh yeah . So the SRI system also does um
[21:30] mn017 | vocal tract length normalization and we couldn't figure out how to do that yet with the ICSI features . So that 's one difference . And the other difference is that
"[21:42] mn017 | in the SRI system ,"
"[21:44] mn017 | the uh th the first the C - zero , the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest . And what they do is"
[21:51] me011 | Huh .
[21:55] mn017 | For each waveform segment
[21:57] mn017 | they subtract the maximum of of th over that waveform segment from
[22:01] mn017 | from the values of for that waveform .
[22:06] me018 | Do they subtract the max from each i one or do they subtract each one from the max ?
[22:12] me018 | Doesn't matter ?
"[22:13] me011 | No , just would be a sign change ."
"[22:14] mn017 | Right , right , right . Um , and then , after But after they done this waveform based normalization , they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features ."
[22:25] mn017 | So it 's their kind of two stage normalization .
"[22:28] mn017 | Um now , I understand that the common practice here has been to just do c standard uh mean subtraction , um on the waveform ."
[22:36] mn017 | Um .
[22:36] me018 | For the C - zero .
"[22:37] mn017 | Right . But in what we 've done so far , because we didn't have any special provision for C - zero , we just treat it as as any of the other features , we 've done standard mean subtraction over the whole"
[22:47] mn017 | conversation side .
[22:49] mn017 | So
"[22:50] mn017 | um since both SRI and ICSI use this sort of local normalization for C - zero that 's presumably , you know , someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better ."
"[23:01] mn017 | Um , so that 's another difference , and that might account for some of the"
"[23:07] mn017 | discrepancies in the results . Um , but you know . So the"
[23:18] mn017 | Where should I start ? Uh
[23:23] mn017 | Oh . I tried it with and without . Uh .
[23:26] mn017 | So without
[23:29] mn017 | and with adaptation .
[23:32] me011 | How many iterations ?
[23:36] mn017 | For the adaptation ?
[23:37] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:38] mn017 | Well , y we always do three EM iterations to"
[23:40] me011 | OK .
"[23:44] mn017 | the phone loop adaptation which doesn't actually require prior recognition paths and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation , but it gives you sort of a first"
[23:53] mn017 | idea of what you could gain with it .
"[23:55] mn017 | And then , you know , so we have the"
[23:59] mn017 | the SRI front - end
[24:01] mn017 | and the ICSI front - end
[24:08] mn017 | They came up with um
"[24:11] mn017 | you know , same number of uh Gaussians per state cluster"
"[24:15] mn017 | Um , same The clustering used the same information loss threshold , which actually led to roughly the same number of Gaussians overall . So that the system configuration is is comparable ."
"[24:31] mn017 | Uh , so without adaptation ,"
[24:35] mn017 | you had forty - nine p
[24:36] mn014 | That 's error rate or recognition rate ?
[24:37] mn017 | This is error rate
[24:42] mn017 | in percent .
[24:44] mn017 | And
[24:45] mn017 | with adaptation
[24:48] mn017 | it 's forty - seven point one
[24:51] mn017 | and
[24:54] mn017 | this this was fifty - two point six .
[24:57] mn017 | and
[24:59] mn017 | fifty - one point three
[25:01] me011 | Hmm .
"[25:02] mn017 | and then , when I combined them I can actually combine them with"
"[25:11] mn017 | Um , here I got"
[25:16] mn017 | forty - eight point five
[25:19] mn017 | and here I got forty - six point five .
[25:23] me011 | So this is just combination at the utterance level .
[25:23] mn017 | Um .
"[25:26] mn017 | At the utterance level , right ."
[25:28] me011 | Why do you think the ICSI front - end is so much worse ?
[25:31] mn017 | Good question . That 's fine .
[25:32] me011 | That seems really odd to me .
"[25:33] mn017 | Um , so , one percent I would attribute to the lack of VTL , about one percent . OK ."
"[25:39] me011 | Oh right . Right , right , right ."
[25:39] mn014 | OK . Ah OK .
"[25:40] mn017 | And then maybe another up I don't know how much the C - zero normalization business really matters I can't it see , I mean can't see it the @ @"
"[25:48] me011 | Ca - can you run the SRI Just as an experiment , run the SRI front - end without vocal tract norma normalization , and see how much difference it makes ?"
[25:53] mn017 | I could . Yeah .
[25:55] mn017 | I could certainly do that . Yeah .
[25:57] mn017 | Um .
[25:59] mn017 | We could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the ICSI features . That 's something we wanted to do yeah . We could I was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the MFCC 's
[26:02] mn014 | Yeah .
[26:02] me011 | If we could figure out how .
[26:08] mn014 | Yeah .
[26:10] mn017 | and just try them with the ICSI
[26:22] mn017 | So .
[26:23] me011 | they don't correspond one - to - one though .
"[26:25] mn017 | No , but they should be"
[26:30] mn017 | Anyway . But I can certainly try the SRI front - end without uh VTL . That sh that 's that 's certainly quick to do .
[26:35] me011 | Yeah .
[26:37] mn017 | Um
"[26:49] mn017 | You know , this front - end"
"[26:51] mn017 | u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it . You know , how many"
[26:53] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:55] mn017 | filter banks do you use , what what bandwidth do you use , and stuff like that . And uh we could play the same kind of games with the ICSI front - end ."
[27:02] me011 | Right .
"[27:03] mn017 | Uh , actually , the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role . We used to use a narrow bandwidth and"
[27:08] mn017 | uh
"[27:10] mn017 | uh that hurt us . So this is , um And this is We 've now used roughly what everybody else is using . So"
[27:14] me011 | Hmm .
"[27:15] mn017 | um , there 's some room for improvements , I figure , in this in the ICSI front - end ."
[27:20] mn017 | Um .
[27:21] mn017 | So .
"[27:23] mn017 | But the good news is that even with this with the ICSI system being that much worse , you still get a win out of combining the two ."
[27:30] mn017 | So that gives some hope for the future .
[27:33] mn017 | Um .
"[27:34] mn017 | Unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation , so ."
[27:39] mn017 | Um .
[27:40] mn017 | Also interestingly
"[27:44] mn017 | Um , the difference actually widens . I would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference because it might"
"[27:51] mn017 | um , for instance ,"
[27:53] mn017 | um
"[28:00] mn017 | You know , som If you if you have some some difference in the front - end processing that"
"[28:04] mn017 | uh is suboptimal , but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the"
[28:09] mn017 | um
"[28:13] mn017 | doesn't really actually the difference becomes larger , so ."
"[28:22] mn017 | Uh well , there 's several things going on . One is that Chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features . So that would actually be the"
[28:33] mn017 | more interesting experiment .
"[28:35] mn017 | Um , the other thing is I 'm training"
[28:43] me011 | Right .
[28:46] mn017 | And I actually want to
[28:48] mn017 | do the system combination
"[28:50] mn017 | um with our eval system um , on some subset of the data at least , probably only for the males , because I don't have time to train both males and females , but um ."
[29:01] me018 | What about ta
[29:03] me018 | concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one ?
[29:06] me011 | It gets pretty big .
[29:08] mn017 | It does get pretty big . Yeah .
[29:09] me018 | Hmm .
[29:10] me011 | And m my experience with that in Broadcast News was usually combining at other levels works better .
[29:15] me018 | Hmm .
[29:16] me011 | So .
[29:17] me011 | For for whatever that 's worth .
"[29:18] mn017 | Oh , you tried that on Broadcast News ? Concatenating"
[29:19] me011 | Oh yeah .
[29:20] me011 | Yeah .
[29:21] me011 | So w Yep .
[29:21] mn017 | different feature sets ? Yeah .
"[29:23] me011 | It was mostly MSG , PLP , RASTA ."
[29:26] mn017 | I see .
"[29:26] me011 | So , you know , the feature sets we had available . And it was almost always better to combine at the probability level . You know , so we 'd run the neural nets and combine the probabilities ."
[29:28] mn017 | I see .
[29:32] mn017 | OK .
[29:34] mn017 | Alright .
[29:36] mn017 | Oh .
"[29:37] mn017 | Yeah , and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors . And that would"
[29:40] me011 | Yep .
[29:42] mn017 | blow up the
[29:43] me011 | You 'd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards
[29:47] me011 | so that they 're uh orthogonal .
[29:49] mn017 | Right .
[29:49] me011 | So you 'd wanna do a linear transform also .
[29:52] mn017 | Right .
[29:54] mn017 | Um
[29:57] mn017 | so
"[29:59] mn017 | the Yeah , and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the ICSI front - end to perform better ."
[30:07] mn017 | Um . And and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can I can certainly run a SRI system without VTL
[30:14] me011 | Yep .
[30:16] fe008 | Wi - without what ? Without VTL . OK .
"[30:17] me011 | Vocal tract thing , yeah ."
[30:18] mn017 | Wh - Yeah .
[30:18] mn017 | And that that 's quick to do .
[30:22] mn017 | So .
[30:22] me011 | I was thinking about
"[30:24] me011 | tandem system Well , let 's not talk about it here , but I had some thoughts about the tandem system ."
"[30:30] mn017 | yeah so but things are moving ahead , so"
"[30:34] me011 | OK , should we do digits ?"
[30:35] mn017 | Digits . Sure .
[30:37] me011 | Do we have any other topics ?
"[30:40] me011 | OK , let 's do them one at a time instead of simultaneous since we actually have time ."
[30:42] mn017 | Poetic reading of digits .
[31:54] me011 | Why don't we let Don go first before his battery dies ?
"[31:58] me001 | Mmm , OK ."
[33:22] fe008 | Do you wanna say that one again ? That last one ?
[33:27] fe008 | Or did did you correct the whole one ?
"[33:27] mn014 | I yeah , sure . Yeah no I I gotta write , so I think . Yeah ."
[34:45] me011 | You can really tell from the prosody where it goes .
[34:46] mn017 | s meeting . I actually have one more thing that I don't know if it 's i if if it 's allowed to to bring up after the dis
"[34:51] me011 | After digits , I don't know ."
[34:53] mn017 | Anyway .
[34:54] mn017 | But it might be important . For um So Liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where
[34:55] me011 | Go ahead .
[35:00] mn017 | it was later found that several of the
"[35:03] mn017 | s microphones were turned off , um"
[35:04] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[35:05] mn017 | and this must become a problem especially with non - speech - meetings .
[35:09] mn017 | So um
[35:11] mn017 | is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from
[35:17] me011 | Probably . We could probably build that in to the front - end .
"[35:25] me018 | What are people doing , they 're switching their mikes off or something ?"
"[35:27] mn017 | I don't know what they do . Maybe the batteries went dead , or th they just didn't they played with the thing and it didn't leave it in the "" on "" position or whatever ."
"[35:43] mn017 | I mean , there 's never gonna be a signal from all the channels , right ? because or rarely ."
[35:48] mn017 | Um .
[35:50] mn017 | But uh .
"[35:52] me011 | Well if an unblacked out channel is zero , is actually spitting out zeros , you can be pretty sure it 's off ."
[35:57] mn017 | Right .
"[35:58] me011 | Because it doesn't spit out zeros , it spits out epsilons ."
"[36:01] me011 | Right ? Cuz there 's little background noise . The question is , when the software detects it , what do you want it to do ?"
[36:03] mn017 | Exactly .
"[36:13] me011 | We we already have visual feedback , right ? You can see whether your mike is working or not . Um ."
[36:15] mn017 | Right .
[36:17] mn017 | Right . So maybe it 's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal .
[36:22] me011 | Yep .
[36:24] me011 | Turn off the screen saver during the meeting .
"[36:27] mn017 | Yeah , something ."
[36:28] fe008 | I think they sh
[36:29] me001 | It it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording .
[36:32] me011 | There 's no sound out right now .
[36:34] me001 | Oh .
[36:34] mn017 | @ @
[36:35] me001 | Never mind .
[36:35] fe008 | It should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting .
[36:37] mn017 | Oh yeah . That 's a good one .
"[36:38] me001 | Wow , that 's not a bad idea ."
[36:40] mn017 | Yeah . OK .
"[36:42] me011 | It 's pretty clear we can detect it , so ."
[36:44] mn017 | Yeah . Alright .
[36:44] me011 | OK . Are we done ?
[36:46] fe008 | Yeah .

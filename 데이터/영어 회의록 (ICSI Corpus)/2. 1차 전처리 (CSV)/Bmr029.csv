"[00:08] me013 | sort of last minute stuff to to , uh , try to get some recognition results ."
"[00:15] me013 | So , uh , on on on meeting data ."
"[00:23] mn017 | Well , we I just started recognition on the"
"[00:26] mn017 | on Thilo 's segments ,"
[00:29] mn017 | which was but using the far far
[00:32] mn017 | the close - talking microphone .
[00:35] mn017 | And you wanted I know you wanted the far - field data .
"[00:37] me013 | Right . So so , we have some stuff with no overlap , uh , for which there would be"
[00:43] me013 | near near - field results .
[00:45] mn017 | Uh - huh .
[00:45] me013 | We wanted to get the far - field results for that .
"[00:48] me013 | And then this this real , uh , long shot thing would be , that we 'd apply Dave 's processing"
"[00:56] me013 | to , uh , potentially training and test data"
[00:59] me013 | and do the look at the same thing . And
[01:06] me013 | one thought was to use We couldn't remember how
"[01:09] me013 | different the numbers were , but if you just worked with males only and used the short training"
"[01:14] me013 | there 're there 're uh , I think Chuck 's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff , it took maybe a day and a half"
[01:19] me013 | to do the training . Yeah .
[01:20] mn017 | To retrain ?
[01:27] mn017 | Yeah .
[01:28] mn017 | Um .
[01:30] mn017 | That 's about right .
"[01:34] mn017 | It depends on who else is using machines , but we have more machines now . So ."
"[01:39] mn017 | It 's more like a day , probably ."
"[01:41] me013 | Um , how much worse is the short training set than the large one , in terms of the ultimate performance ?"
[01:53] mn017 | three or four percent absolute .
[01:53] me013 | Yep .
"[01:55] me013 | So , it 's that should be fine for this , I would think ."
[01:59] me013 | So we an and you have the short you have short training results for
[02:03] me013 | the close case ?
"[02:05] mn017 | Um , not for meetings ."
[02:13] mn017 | with the
[02:15] mn017 | small models on meeting data .
"[02:19] mn017 | But I I have the models , so I could"
"[02:22] me013 | So , how do you know it 's ? Oh , it 's three percent on on , uh , on Hub - five ."
[02:22] mn017 | run reco
[02:25] me018 | Hub - five .
[02:27] me013 | I see .
"[02:32] me013 | So the question is , what ?"
"[02:42] mn017 | we might wanna restrict it to , maybe , a few meetings ,"
[02:46] mn017 | if you want to do a full comparison .
[02:49] mn017 | Uh .
"[02:51] me013 | I mean , it 's the non - overlap only ."
[02:57] me013 | it has to be enough to be sort of comparable to what
[03:01] me013 | you folks were seeing and what you reported already .
[03:05] mn017 | Hmm .
[03:13] me013 | No . He has to create that .
[03:14] mn017 | Right .
[03:18] me013 | We have a whole parallel set of things over here
[03:20] mn017 | Mmm .
[03:21] me013 | which are all with digits .
[03:23] mn017 | I see .
[03:23] me013 | And and and Dave has been working with that and there 's all of those issues .
"[03:40] me013 | uh , a l a lot tha tha"
"[03:42] me013 | a particular test set , that you that we reported at HLT ."
[03:43] mn017 | Hmm .
[03:46] mn017 | Right .
"[03:52] me013 | Um , and then ,"
"[03:54] me013 | uh , if we could on top of that I mean , so this is gonna be a lot worse . Right ?"
"[03:58] me013 | Whatever comparison we w w one would presume . But we don't know how much worse ,"
[03:59] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[04:02] mn017 | Right .
"[04:02] me013 | w w uh , which is certainly one interesting thing ."
"[04:05] me013 | And then , um ,"
[04:19] me013 | How many hours of training ?
"[04:21] mn017 | I recently retrained ,"
"[04:24] mn017 | for another reason , on the full training set ."
[04:33] me013 | Yeah .
"[04:34] mn017 | So , it 's actually conceivable"
[04:36] mn017 | to do use the full training set .
"[04:45] mn017 | Oh , I see ."
[04:45] me013 | be worth doing it .
[04:47] me013 | How big is the small training set ?
[04:51] me013 | Do you remember ?
"[05:11] mn017 | thirty and fifty hours , maybe . I f I forget the"
[05:14] me013 | It 's around there .
[05:14] mn017 | exac Right .
"[05:15] me013 | And ha and and male is roughly half of that , or ?"
"[05:18] me018 | Well , that 's only male ."
[05:19] me013 | Or or or was that only male ?
[05:22] mn017 | I I can look it up .
"[05:23] mn017 | It 's it 's it 's just , uh , I don't know the remember the the number ."
[05:28] me018 | We could only jus just do the male only right ? Or
[05:28] me013 | OK .
[05:32] me018 | will we run into trouble when we g ?
[05:34] me018 | Yeah .
[05:37] mn017 | Yeah . I would say we you do only males .
[05:39] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:43] me013 | Yeah . So that 's certainly part of the issue , is that right now he 's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency ."
[05:50] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:51] me013 | And , uh , it 's not an impossible amount of time . We we were"
"[05:55] me013 | guestimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time , or something ?"
"[05:59] me013 | So , if there 's thirty hours of data , you can calculate"
[06:00] mn017 | u
"[06:04] me013 | that he can do , uh , the enhancement in"
[06:06] me013 | a day
[06:08] mn017 | Hmm .
[06:09] me013 | But
"[06:10] me013 | if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive ."
[06:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:22] mn017 | It 's uh , I think it 's around thirty hours"
[06:25] me018 | That 's what I was thinking . Yeah .
[06:25] me013 | Yeah .
[06:26] mn017 | for one gender . Yeah .
"[06:28] me013 | Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push , but it seems like ,"
"[06:30] me013 | OK , we 've got some models , we 've got some training data , we have software that works , he 's got"
"[06:34] me013 | a method that helps with , you know , other ta another task ."
"[06:39] me013 | It , you know , appears to be , you know , debugged ."
[06:39] me018 | S
[06:42] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:43] me018 | So We - Yo - So , one thing I was wondering is ,"
[06:46] me018 | did you already do that middle one or should
"[06:48] me018 | we re - do that one , too ?"
"[06:50] mn017 | No . I didn't do that , because we haven't even"
[06:52] me018 | You didn't do that . OK .
[06:57] mn017 | Right . So .
[07:04] me013 | Yes .
"[07:07] mn017 | um , what segmentations you want to use ."
"[07:13] mn017 | Um , I 'm sorry ."
"[07:15] mn017 | Don just , uh , created"
[07:17] mn017 | a new
"[07:33] mn017 | to use those segmentations , because"
[07:36] mn017 | th then we could claim that everything 's automatic .
[07:41] me018 | Do you know when he 'll have the the comparison ?
[07:41] mn017 | Right .
"[07:44] mn017 | Well , I 'm as I said , I just started the recognizer ,"
"[07:57] me013 | Oh . Well , that 's not bad ."
"[07:58] me018 | Oh , OK . So cuz I don't think the new data"
"[08:01] me018 | will be ready , uh ,"
[08:04] me018 | for a couple days may probably .
[08:06] me013 | You mean the training .
"[08:06] me018 | So , the training ."
[08:09] mn017 | But the segmentations matter for the
[08:09] me013 | Yeah .
[08:13] me013 | For the test .
"[08:14] mn017 | For the test set . Yeah . So ,"
"[08:15] me013 | Yeah , fo"
[08:15] me018 | Yeah .
"[08:16] mn017 | But , first first ,"
"[08:18] mn017 | of course , you would wanna process the training data , because we wanna get that started . Yeah ."
[08:21] me013 | Right .
[08:23] me013 | Yeah .
[08:30] me013 | i i
"[08:30] me013 | I mean , since you 're gonna find out in a short amount of time , that 's great ."
[08:32] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:33] me013 | But i if if it doesn't work out , I think we would rather charge ahead with the older"
[08:35] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[08:38] mn017 | Right .
"[08:40] me013 | Um , and we were gonna use one of the P Z Ms ."
[08:43] me013 | Probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits . Is it this one ?
[08:45] me018 | I think it 's that one . Right ?
[08:46] me026 | It 's e F .
[08:47] me018 | F .
"[08:48] me018 | Yeah , that 's it ."
[08:48] me013 | I I 'd which ? That 's F ? How do you know ?
[08:50] me018 | That 's F .
[08:51] me018 | It 's the second nearest the machine room .
[08:54] me013 | Oh .
[09:01] me013 | Bet they 'll have fun with that one .
"[09:07] me018 | OK . So , uh , I just want to make sure I understand what we need to run ."
"[09:15] me018 | Let 's see . So , it 's OK , so if we 're talking about Let 's let 's assume that we 're gonna use the new segmentations ."
"[09:21] me018 | We need to ,"
[09:24] me018 | run recognition o just looking at the no overlap column .
"[09:28] me018 | Basically , we have to d r do recognitions for all three of those cases . Right ?"
[09:33] me013 | Right .
"[09:33] me018 | Um , because we 're gonna be using the just the male ,"
[09:39] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[09:41] mn017 | Ma - maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder
[09:45] mn017 | meetings ?
[09:47] me018 | OK .
"[09:47] mn017 | Um ,"
"[09:48] mn017 | if you were gonna cut down on the test set , I would suggest that ."
"[09:52] me013 | Maybe . But , I I mean , how long does it take"
"[09:54] mn017 | Actually , the longer the Robustness meetings take longer , because there 's this one speaker who talks a lot ."
[09:54] me013 | for the test ?
[09:59] mn017 | And so
[10:09] mn017 | you cannot chop it up into small pieces .
"[10:11] mn017 | So , you 're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker ,"
"[10:16] mn017 | uh ,"
[10:17] mn017 | is s speaking .
[10:19] mn017 | So how much data there is from the the speaker who talks the most .
"[10:24] mn017 | um , you parallelize across different speakers ,"
[10:27] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:28] mn017 | you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh"
[10:28] me013 | Right .
"[10:33] mn017 | effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process . So ."
[10:34] me018 | Right .
[10:36] me018 | Yeah .
"[10:37] me013 | But what what was your result for uh , that we had at the HLT ? Was that a combination of me ?"
"[10:42] mn017 | That was both types of meetings , but most but there were only two Robustness meetings , and four or five ,"
"[10:47] mn017 | uh , Meeting Recorders ."
[10:51] mn017 | Right .
"[10:54] me018 | How long would it take to run recognition , if we did that ?"
[11:06] mn017 | I don't have I don't have a good gue
"[11:07] me018 | I mean , is is it like a day or is it a few hours or roughly ?"
[11:10] mn017 | For everything ? For all the meetings ?
"[11:12] me018 | For yeah , let 's say we just did the Meeting Recorder meetings for our test set ."
"[11:22] mn017 | It 's probably more than a day , but probably less than two ."
"[11:25] me018 | Oh , really . I didn't realize each test took that long ."
"[11:27] mn017 | Well , i No . I mean for all the meetings ."
"[11:42] mn017 | Again , we we I ran when we ran these ,"
"[11:44] mn017 | we were sort of short on machines , and , um ,"
[11:46] me018 | Mmm .
"[11:49] mn017 | I don't know , I I would estimate maybe four hours per meeting ."
[11:53] mn017 | Something like that .
[11:54] me018 | Four hours per meeting .
[11:56] mn017 | Right .
"[11:59] me013 | So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day . We also have more machines now ."
[12:03] mn017 | Right .
[12:06] mn017 | Right . So that 's why I 'm saying I 'm not sure how they would scale with more machines .
[12:07] me013 | Yeah .
[12:09] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:09] me013 | I mean , if we had about six A six hour test set 's not bad . Right ?"
[12:15] mn017 | Right .
[12:16] me018 | S six hour test set .
[12:19] me018 | Six meetings . OK .
[12:19] me013 | You know ?
[12:22] mn014 | Yeah . We did .
"[12:25] mn017 | two , th We have two , three , four , fi I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with ."
[12:31] me013 | Four that you worked with ?
[12:32] mn014 | Is it the same set as the alignments ? I think it 's five Meeting Recorder meetings .
[12:33] mn017 | Yeah .
[12:35] mn017 | Five ?
[12:36] mn017 | OK .
[12:41] me013 | Did you
"[12:42] me013 | do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings , or was it ?"
"[12:47] mn017 | Uh , with the Robust - compared to Robustness ?"
[12:50] mn017 | Yeah .
[12:51] mn017 | The big variation is by whether it 's a native speaker
[12:55] me013 | Yeah .
[12:55] mn017 | or not .
[12:56] mn017 | And whether
"[13:00] mn017 | Uh , I think that 's the o actually and and of course what ,"
"[13:03] mn017 | um ,"
"[13:04] mn017 | you know , whether it 's lapel or ,"
"[13:07] mn017 | uh , headset microphone ."
[13:08] me013 | And overlap or not . Yeah .
[13:09] mn017 | Yeah .
[13:14] me013 | De - th that you did before .
"[13:19] mn017 | I mean , in fact , we excluded them previously"
[13:20] me013 | Yeah . So we want to do the same same thing .
[13:21] mn017 | Right .
[13:23] me018 | OK . So Alright . So if we got a list
"[13:26] me018 | of the ,"
"[13:27] me018 | uh , segmentations for these five Meeting Recorder meetings , we could start ,"
"[13:31] me018 | uh , the first two"
"[13:34] me018 | experiments going right away , using the short male models ."
[13:40] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:41] me018 | So , you could get those going while"
"[13:44] me018 | Dave is , um , creating waveforms for the r retraining the short male models ."
[13:47] me013 | Yeah .
"[13:55] me018 | OK . So , do we w also want to run"
[13:59] me018 | that bottom experiment without
[14:03] me018 | retraining the short male models on his thing ? Did you want that ?
[14:07] me018 | Or ?
"[14:08] me013 | Um ,"
"[14:09] me013 | I I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do , but I sort of regard it as secondary ."
"[14:13] me018 | OK . So , we 'll save that ."
[14:13] me013 | So if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for
"[14:26] me013 | Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing"
"[14:32] me013 | made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone . In which case"
[14:35] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[14:36] me013 | you shouldn't have to actually retrain .
"[14:38] me013 | But it 's it 's not really true . It 's it 's sort of fantasy . It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways . And so ,"
[14:42] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:48] me018 | Well , on a more basic level , also , it means that"
"[14:50] me018 | that third experiment , there are actually two differences between the other experiments , not one ."
[14:54] me013 | Right .
[14:58] me018 | Right .
"[14:59] me013 | Uh , that 's right ."
[15:05] me013 | to is if there was some problem
[15:08] me013 | in the retraining .
"[15:10] me013 | I mean , maybe you 'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong ."
[15:13] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:15] me013 | Uh , that , uh since Dave 's experience was that"
[15:15] me018 | Right .
"[15:20] me013 | it didn't help as much if you didn't retrain , but it does help some ,"
[15:25] me013 | that we would hopefully see that .
[15:26] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:27] me013 | So , that that 's that 's true ."
[15:29] me013 | I i
[15:30] mn017 | So when you used
"[15:32] mn017 | original the original models , and you just process"
[15:40] mn017 | do you get decent performance or not ?
"[15:42] me026 | I I I think , um ,"
"[15:44] me026 | for the far - mike HTK system I was using ,"
[15:47] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[15:48] me026 | it did help somewhat . I could re - check that . But it was such a bad baseline
[15:52] mn017 | Mmm .
[15:52] me026 | that
[15:53] me026 | I don't know what that means .
[15:53] mn017 | Right .
[15:54] mn017 | Right .
[15:56] mn017 | OK .
[15:57] me026 | Cuz the baseline word error rate was around forty percent on digits .
[16:00] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[16:01] me018 | On the far - field ?
[16:02] me026 | Right .
[16:08] me013 | Right .
[16:14] mn017 | the one that already has a
[16:16] mn017 | cross there . We need to re - do that with small models .
[16:19] mn017 | Right .
[16:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[16:20] mn017 | And then , have to ask , um ,"
"[16:23] mn017 | I guess , Don"
"[16:25] mn017 | to , uh , cut the ,"
"[16:28] mn017 | um ,"
[16:29] mn017 | cut the segments for the sh
[16:31] mn017 | for the tis distant mike .
[16:34] mn017 | So we would be using the same channel
[16:37] mn017 | for each fo for everything ?
[16:38] me013 | Yeah .
[16:38] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[16:39] mn017 | OK .
[16:40] mn017 | So .
[16:47] mn017 | extract the wavef form segments from a different channel .
[16:47] me013 | Oh . OK .
[16:50] me013 | Got it .
[16:51] mn017 | Right .
"[16:52] me018 | So when you said you were gonna start that top one , were you gonna use the new segmentations ?"
[16:54] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[17:00] mn017 | Yeah .
[17:01] me018 | OK .
[17:01] mn017 | If assuming that
[17:03] mn017 | the performance
[17:07] mn017 | with the old experiments
[17:10] me018 | Right . OK .
[17:10] mn017 | and the old segmentations .
"[17:16] mn017 | Oh , OK . So there 's the issue of speaker normalization . So ,"
[17:19] mn017 | with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker
[17:23] mn017 | is talking .
[17:26] mn017 | Right ?
[17:28] me018 | Can we ?
[17:28] me013 | We we talked about this before .
"[17:30] me013 | I think what we were saying was that , um ,"
[17:34] me013 | the very fact that in both cases we 're ignoring the overlap section
"[17:38] me013 | means that , um ,"
"[17:41] me013 | uh ,"
"[17:43] me013 | we 're to some extent finessing that . So ,"
"[17:46] me013 | um , I think ,"
"[17:52] me013 | uh , what the effect of the far - field microphone is , we should do the same to both ."
[17:55] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[17:57] mn017 | I see . So you want to cheat ?
[18:20] mn017 | in a way that 's compatible with the close - talking
[18:24] me013 | Yeah .
[18:24] mn017 | test set . OK .
[18:24] me013 | We we simply wanna determine what 's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close .
"[18:28] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
"[18:29] me018 | So ,"
"[18:30] me018 | does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it ? Or you just let it do what it would do , an ?"
[18:33] mn017 | No . It means No . It just means
[18:37] mn017 | you you group together
[18:40] mn017 | the segments that by magic you know belong
"[18:44] mn017 | to one speaker ,"
"[18:45] me013 | I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way , too , because"
[18:48] me013 | you have leakage into other microphones . Right ?
"[18:50] me013 | But , it 's just you 're using the fact that"
[18:52] mn017 | Right .
[18:52] me013 | this is
[18:54] me013 | where this person is . Right ?
[18:55] me013 | So .
[18:58] me013 | It 's just easier to do .
"[18:59] mn017 | Well , in the new test , actually , that 's not true ."
"[19:03] mn017 | Again , if this if these new segmentations work OK ,"
[19:07] me013 | Yeah .
[19:10] mn017 | it 's a completely fair test .
"[19:12] me013 | So , how do you determine what you use to group together to be a a ?"
[19:16] mn017 | You group together all the data coming in through one channel
[19:24] mn017 | has determined that there is speech .
"[19:27] mn017 | And that speech is is deemed to come from that speaker , whether that 's true or not ."
"[19:32] mn017 | So if you get some cross - talk from another microphone , then you just"
[19:35] mn017 | process this it as if it were from that speaker .
[19:38] me013 | The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both .
"[19:42] mn017 | Well , that 's more of a problem ."
"[19:44] mn017 | I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of"
"[19:49] mn017 | gene I mean you can pretend it 's all from one speaker and do all this processing the same ,"
[19:53] mn017 | but then you 're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper
"[20:00] mn017 | So , you could certainly do better than that by doing , for instance uh , cluster the segments ,"
"[20:06] mn017 | which is what we do , say , in a Broadcast News system , where you don't have speaker labels ."
[20:11] mn017 | But that would be another processing step that
"[20:14] mn017 | I 'm I would have to debug first , and so forth , and so we wanna avoid that ."
[20:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:22] mn017 | you know , this sort of cheating experiment ."
[20:26] me013 | OK .
[20:33] me013 | The the other
"[20:35] me013 | difference that we 'd have to take care of is that , uh yeah , we we don't have a mike that , uh ,"
"[20:47] me013 | another , uh , issue , too ."
[20:50] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:52] me013 | But , it it I could be wrong , but it seems to me that that"
[20:58] me013 | the level of degradation that you get
[21:01] me013 | from
[21:02] me013 | having the distant mike in a normal acoustic
[21:04] mn017 | Hmm .
[21:04] mn017 | It 's not just speaker adaptation . It 's the whole
"[21:06] me013 | is much greater than what you get from , say , not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation ."
"[21:13] me013 | I mean , we 'll see . But but , I think that the kind of gains that we 've seen from speaker adaptation"
"[21:33] mn017 | So , in that I 'm ,"
"[21:37] mn017 | Y you know , d d b the most important , of course , is the cepstral mean subtraction ."
[21:42] me013 | Yeah .
"[21:44] mn017 | I don't know if we we never really I don't remember ,"
"[21:52] me013 | It doesn't make that much difference , I think . I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that ."
"[21:57] me013 | So , I mean , I I think that that difference would definitely be marginal ."
[22:01] me013 | I think the main thing is to do something to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level .
"[22:06] me013 | And , uh , so what 's different about this processing is just that we 're doing it"
[22:09] me013 | at a much longer time scale . Right ?
[22:11] me018 | Hmm .
[22:11] mn017 | Mmm .
[22:17] me026 | What wo
[22:24] mn017 | the segmentations assume that we have access to all channels and
[22:28] mn017 | cross
[22:29] me013 | That 's right .
[22:31] mn017 | there 's no point in not using that knowledge for speaker identification .
[22:34] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:35] me026 | Uh , I I think also for the log spectral mean subtraction ,"
[22:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:40] me026 | uh , we wanna know which speaker 's talking when , cuz we wanna"
[22:45] mn017 | Yeah .
[22:48] mn017 | Right .
[22:49] me013 | Right .
[22:50] mn017 | OK .
"[22:55] me013 | But , um ,"
"[22:57] me013 | I also think that a again once we got into it , that , um , using some kind of clustering would probably"
"[23:04] me013 | work reasonably well there , too ."
"[23:07] me013 | Certainly for the the two microphone case , which we 're not gonna mess with because it 's another whole"
"[23:13] me013 | deal with the low - quality microphones , um ,"
[23:16] me013 | we ought to be able to at least tell
[23:18] me013 | that it appears that things are coming from a particular direction .
"[23:22] me013 | So we ought to be able to use that information ,"
"[23:24] me013 | um , as well ."
"[23:26] me013 | But , I think we might"
[23:28] me013 | be able to do not too bad a job of
[23:31] me013 | separating out
[23:34] me013 | sp
"[23:34] me013 | uh , segments that appear to come from a single speaker"
[23:38] me013 | both in terms of s acoustic similarity and in terms of direction .
"[23:41] me013 | So , I mean But that 's another research thing to do and probably won't get done the next week ."
"[23:49] me013 | Well , I mean , I 'm I 'm leaving for for the , uh ,"
[23:55] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:55] me013 | and , um , it 'd be kinda nice to have"
"[23:58] me013 | some results at least a day or two before that , so that I could"
[24:01] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[24:02] me013 | figure out what I wanted to say about it .
"[24:03] mn017 | Oh , we 'll call you when you get there ."
[24:07] me018 | You 'll have email . Right ?
"[24:10] me013 | Uh , not to mention that that , uh , Mari 's putting together this report"
[24:14] mn017 | OK .
"[24:16] me013 | Uh ,"
"[24:16] me013 | what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do , uh , the , um , calculation on the training set"
[24:22] mn017 | Mmm .
"[24:27] me013 | by the end of the weekend , we could have the top one , and and then"
"[24:30] me013 | early next week , do these ."
[24:32] mn017 | Mmm .
"[24:32] me013 | If we had enough machines , maybe do them in parallel ."
[24:34] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[24:35] me013 | So that by the middle of the week we had s had some kind of result .
[24:44] me013 | might might not work out .
"[24:45] me013 | But , uh , f figured I may as well ask for it ."
[24:50] me018 | So ?
[25:02] mn017 | far microphone .
"[25:07] mn017 | use the old um ,"
"[25:11] mn017 | the the the old , uh , segmentations ,"
[25:12] me018 | Segmentation ?
"[25:15] mn017 | then we 'll just use that , I figure ."
[25:19] me013 | Right .
"[25:20] me018 | S So ,"
[25:21] me018 | um .
[25:23] me018 | I don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff . What what can I do to ?
"[25:29] me018 | Y y you said it would be easy for you to do that top one there , and I guess Don can do the segmentations of the ,"
"[25:36] me018 | uh , channel F ?"
[25:37] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:41] me018 | I mean , I can certainly help with , uh , retraining the short male models ,"
[25:45] mn017 | Right .
"[25:45] me018 | uh , once we have the new data ."
[25:47] me013 | You have models of short males ?
[25:52] mn017 | Yeah .
"[25:56] mn017 | Right . Uh , let 's see . The the"
"[26:03] mn017 | you could run the ,"
"[26:05] mn017 | um ,"
"[26:06] mn017 | you c Basically , once"
"[26:09] mn017 | the , um ,"
[26:11] me018 | The top one is done . I c
"[26:11] mn017 | whe the top the top one 's done , you could easily re - run the whole set of experiments ."
[26:13] me018 | I can re - do the next one . Yeah .
[26:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:17] mn017 | Uh , I mean ,"
[26:20] me018 | Yeah . Sure .
"[26:23] me018 | the bottom one would b just be a matter of pointing it at a new set of files and kicking it off , so that would be re"
[26:29] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[26:29] me018 | would be really easy once you 've got the top one going . I could do that .
[26:32] mn017 | Yeah .
[26:33] mn017 | Right .
[26:34] me018 | OK . So I guess I just need to
"[26:36] me018 | get Don to ,"
"[26:41] mn017 | Assuming he uses the new naming scheme , then"
[26:45] mn017 | he should call the waveforms
"[26:48] mn017 | the so , the waveform names have the , you know , meeting meeting ID ,"
"[26:53] mn017 | and the microphone ,"
"[26:56] mn017 | and the ,"
"[26:59] mn017 | I guess , the channel and the microphone and the speaker ,"
"[27:02] mn017 | um ,"
[27:03] mn017 | speaker some something that identifies the speaker .
[27:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:08] me018 | To keep it the same but j just change them all to channel F ?
"[27:11] mn017 | Exactly . So , uh well , you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers ."
[27:15] me018 | Right . Right .
[27:17] me018 | Yeah .
"[27:22] mn017 | You know , you make the channel be channel F ,"
[27:24] me018 | Yeah .
[27:25] me018 | OK .
"[27:28] mn017 | in the close - talking ,"
"[27:30] mn017 | uh ,"
[27:32] mn017 | version .
[27:32] me018 | OK . And so that 's something that Don would do right ? when he creates these .
[27:35] mn017 | Right . Exactly .
[27:37] me018 | OK . OK .
"[27:39] me018 | So will you talk to him about that , or do you want me to talk to him ?"
"[27:41] mn017 | I , uh , I I can talk to him ."
[27:43] me018 | OK .
[27:46] me018 | And then the bottom one in terms of the test will be ?
"[27:54] me018 | That will just be a copy of the one above it , except for different models"
"[28:00] me026 | Well , we also have to mean subtract the test data ."
[28:00] me018 | from training .
[28:03] me018 | Ah . OK .
"[28:05] me018 | So , we need to run ?"
[28:07] me018 | OK .
"[28:11] me018 | Well , once I do that , uh , second experiment , we 'll have the ,"
"[28:15] me018 | um , files , and I can give you those to to process ."
[28:18] me026 | OK .
"[28:19] me026 | And there 's , um ,"
"[28:20] me026 | S so the way this means subtraction expects to work , is it expects"
"[28:24] me026 | to have , um ,"
[28:26] me026 | this continuous stream of audio data
"[28:28] me026 | from a particular speaker to operate on . And it goes along it with this sliding window ,"
"[28:31] me026 | calculating the mean using the data in the window ,"
[28:34] me026 | and then subtracting that .
"[28:36] me018 | So , do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files ?"
"[28:39] me026 | That 's that 's how I 've been doing it , just by concatenating files together ."
[28:41] mn017 | Hmm .
"[28:43] me026 | Um , and if these files and the since they 're individual utterance files , um ,"
"[28:48] me026 | s long silence periods are removed , which is a good thing ."
"[28:51] me026 | Because this method might estimate the mean badly , if it had to face long silence periods ."
[28:58] me026 | I need twice as much disk space as the original set
"[29:06] me026 | um , of these big files ,"
[29:07] me018 | Yeah .
"[29:07] me026 | and then create the finally , the mean subtracted , um , little files ."
[29:12] me026 | And then I can get rid of the big files .
"[29:16] me026 | But st while I 'm doing the processing , I 'll nee I need twice as much disk space ."
"[29:20] me018 | OK . I 'm gonna I 'll check with , um ,"
"[29:23] me018 | Markham , and see what happened with the the disks ."
[29:27] me013 | I think Markham 's out on vacation .
"[29:29] me013 | I think , che check with Dave . Yeah ."
"[29:30] me018 | Oh , OK . I 'll ask David , then ."
[29:30] mn014 | Yeah .
"[29:32] me018 | You haven't seen new disks pop up , have you ?"
[29:34] mn014 | Nope .
[29:35] mn014 | I was wondering if they were in .
[29:35] me018 | OK .
[29:36] me018 | Yeah .
"[29:36] mn017 | Well , they grow them on trees now ."
"[29:40] mn017 | Just , you shake them and they fall down ."
[29:43] me018 | He went to put them on and then something happened .
"[29:45] me018 | And he sent around a note saying "" Oh , uh ,"
[29:45] mn014 | Yeah .
[29:47] mn014 | Yeah . Something w went wrong .
"[29:48] me018 | it didn't work , and"
"[29:49] me018 | we 'll have to schedule another time . "" And then ,"
[29:51] me018 | didn't see nothing happened .
[29:51] mn014 | Nothing happened . No ? Yeah .
[29:53] me018 | I 'll check with David about that .
[29:55] me018 | OK .
[29:55] mn017 | OK .
"[29:57] me013 | Cuz we still all have tha the that other one going , which is the , uh the Macrophone"
"[30:04] me026 | So so , Andreas , um ,"
[30:05] mn017 | Mm - hmm ?
"[30:06] me026 | in U doctor speech data SRI Hub - five , there 's this , uh , Hub - five training set . Now , is that the long training set there ?"
[30:08] mn017 | Mmm .
[30:08] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[30:10] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[30:14] me026 | OK .
"[30:15] mn017 | So , I can give you a list of the short version ."
"[30:18] me026 | OK . I th I think you already did , actually ."
"[30:20] mn017 | Oh , OK ."
"[30:21] me026 | OK . And so , say the Macrophone files that are included in this short training , are just"
[30:24] me026 | a subset of the Macrophone files . Right ?
[30:28] mn017 | That 's right .
"[30:29] me026 | OK . So so , um when you You did some TI - digits t t experiments training on Macrophone ."
[30:35] mn017 | Yeah .
[30:36] me026 | Um .
[30:37] me026 | But that 's not necessarily any less data than the SRI Hub - five
[30:41] me026 | set . It 's not a it 's not a subset of the short SRI Hu - Hub - five set . Right ?
"[30:49] mn017 | Wel - No , it is ."
[30:51] mn017 | Sorry . Um .
[30:53] mn017 | Can you repeat the question ? There wa it is a subse Yeah .
"[30:54] me026 | Uh , whe when you trained on Macrophone , um , to do those digits experiments , did you use the entire Macrophone corpus ?"
[30:59] mn017 | No . Only the portion that was in the Hub - five training set .
[31:01] me026 | Oh . OK .
[31:02] me013 | That was in the Hub - five small training set ?
"[31:05] mn017 | Well , the Hub - five small training set contains"
"[31:08] mn017 | as much Macrophone as the large training set ,"
[31:10] me013 | Yes .
[31:10] mn017 | for historical reasons . Yeah .
"[31:17] mn017 | So , do you have that processed there , then right ?"
[31:19] mn017 | Because you already did did y didn't you already do that experiment ?
"[31:22] me026 | I I got confused , cuz I thought I thought you were using"
[31:23] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[31:26] mn017 | No .
[31:27] me026 | Um . OK .
[31:34] me026 | I think I got f
"[31:35] me026 | into it before , and then I thought I was doing the wrong thing and I stopped . And it shouldn it shouldn't take that long to do ."
[31:37] mn017 | Mmm .
[31:38] mn017 | OK .
[31:42] me013 | OK .
[31:43] mn017 | And you need only the males . So .
"[31:46] me018 | So , basically , Dave , so y for you to get your processing going , you need the list of the , uh , wave"
"[31:53] me018 | Well , I guess it 'll dep you 'll you 'll we 'll need to get the segmentations ."
[31:56] me026 | Yeah .
[31:56] me018 | Figure out whether we 're using the new or the old from Don .
[31:58] mn017 | Hmm .
"[31:59] me018 | And then , uh ,"
[32:02] me018 | from that you need the from the segmentations you 'll have the list of
"[32:06] me018 | wavefiles that the short ,"
"[32:08] me018 | uh , set is trained on ."
"[32:10] me018 | you 'll need disk space . And once you 've got those things , then you can start your processing . Right ?"
[32:15] me026 | Yeah .
[32:15] me018 | OK .
[32:18] mn017 | Does this th this ?
[32:21] mn017 | It - it 's sort of f f
"[32:22] mn017 | not very nice to use the small training set for another reason , which is that the"
"[32:29] mn017 | Again ,"
[32:29] mn017 | because you don't use all the data you have for one speaker .
"[32:33] mn017 | So , the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be ,"
"[32:38] mn017 | uh , crummier than they would in the large training set ."
"[32:49] mn017 | uh , I have to"
[32:52] mn017 | use short models that were trained on normalizations that were also only estimated on the short
[33:00] mn017 | set .
[33:09] mn017 | a few hours actually at if I use
[33:12] mn017 | machines at SRI .
"[33:12] me013 | I wonder about that , though ."
[33:13] mn017 | Hmm ?
"[33:13] me013 | I mean , because"
[33:16] me013 | all we 're doing The only reason we 're using the short training set is is for speed .
[33:21] me013 | And there we 're not really making any claims about using a smaller training set .
[33:21] mn017 | Yeah .
"[33:32] mn017 | if we used the whole training set for normalizations ,"
[33:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[33:35] mn017 | then David would have to process much more data ,"
"[33:39] mn017 | which That 's a that 's one bottleneck , for us right , in terms of get"
"[33:42] me013 | Oh , you mean for for his normalizations ."
[33:43] mn017 | Yeah .
"[33:44] me013 | Oh , oh , oh . I 'm sorry ."
[33:45] mn017 | Right .
[33:47] me013 | Right .
[33:50] me013 | Yeah .
[33:53] mn017 | So .
[33:57] mn017 | It doesn't make I don't think it makes that much of a difference . It 's just this
[34:01] mn017 | little detail that
[34:03] mn017 | if you can
"[34:04] mn017 | take care of that , then you should ."
[34:15] mn017 | Yeah . And if not I can retrain those models very
"[34:17] me018 | Oh , there 's there 's one other issue ,"
[34:18] mn017 | quickly .
"[34:20] me018 | uh , and that is that Dave throws out"
[34:24] me018 | speakers that have less than twelve seconds of training data .
[34:29] me018 | And he said there were a few in the Macrophone set like that .
"[34:34] me018 | So , do we need to wait"
"[34:36] me018 | to find out who he 's gonna throw out , so that we create"
[34:39] me018 | a new set of short models that don't include those speakers ?
[34:46] me013 | Say this again ?
"[34:50] me018 | Th - the problem is that if we proceed like we just described ,"
[34:54] me018 | when he goes to
"[34:57] me018 | create the new s training data with his processing , he throws out some speakers ."
[35:01] me018 | So the t two training sets won't be identical .
[35:04] mn017 | Yeah .
[35:04] me013 | He throws out some speakers that are that are very small .
[35:07] me018 | Yeah . Have just a little bit .
[35:08] mn017 | Yeah . I don't think it 'll make a matter .
[35:10] me013 | Yeah . I think there was only a few
[35:10] me018 | OK .
[35:12] me013 | we thought to be the case . Righ - ?
"[35:13] mn017 | In fact , I thought about throwing those out too , because"
[35:21] me018 | Yeah .
[35:22] me013 | Right .
"[35:22] mn017 | all all over the map , and"
[35:24] mn017 | you won't get
[35:25] mn017 | very very clean
"[35:26] mn017 | models from them , anyhow . So ."
"[35:30] me018 | So you think it 's OK , then ?"
"[35:31] mn017 | Yeah . In fact ,"
"[35:33] mn017 | if if you wanna do this , uh , to speed things up ,"
"[35:37] mn017 | um ,"
[35:39] mn017 | you we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether .
"[35:45] mn017 | Actually . Oh , no . Sorry ."
[35:46] mn017 | Not in the short . Then you have too little data . OK .
[35:48] mn017 | Sorry . Forget that .
"[35:50] mn017 | Um ,"
"[35:51] mn017 | When you use when you go to the large training set ,"
[35:54] mn017 | then leaving out Macrophone
[36:00] me018 | It 's read .
[36:02] mn017 | to the meeting and or to conversational speech anyway .
"[36:09] mn017 | Um , in the event that I retrain the short models ,"
"[36:12] mn017 | um , why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out , and I I 'll throw them out , too ."
[36:15] me026 | Right .
[36:19] mn017 | completely identical training conditions .
[36:21] me018 | We sh
[36:21] me018 | M Right .
"[36:22] me018 | A actually you should be able to figure out ,"
"[36:25] me018 | Dave , right , once you know the segmentations ,"
[36:27] me026 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:30] me018 | which speakers will get left out , even before you run your processing . Right ?"
[36:33] me026 | The segmentations ?
[36:34] me018 | Yeah . The segmentations from Don ?
[36:36] me018 | Once we ?
[36:36] me026 | Oh .
[36:38] mn017 | they only affect the test set .
[36:39] mn017 | We 're talking about the training speakers .
"[36:40] me018 | Ah . Right , right , right , right , right ."
[36:46] me018 | Right . But I 'm just wondering how long it will take to get
[36:49] me018 | that information .
[36:51] mn017 | He already has the in you already have the information . Right ?
"[36:55] me026 | for Macrophone , um ,"
"[36:57] me026 | already , I think , and , um , I think by tomorrow I 'll have it"
[37:01] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[37:02] mn017 | OK .
[37:03] me026 | for th for the rest .
[37:06] mn017 | Alright .
[37:10] me018 | OK .
[37:14] mn017 | OK .
[37:15] me013 | At that one ? Maybe .
[37:19] me013 | Been looking at synthesizers ?
[37:21] mn014 | Synthesizers ?
[37:23] me013 | You were looking at Festival . Yeah .
"[37:23] mn014 | Yeah , yeah . I was doing something for the SmartKom data collectioners ."
[37:27] mn014 | Robert has taken his laptop t back to Germany so we needed a new synthesis machine .
"[37:32] mn014 | And we have now a SUN workstation in the library ,"
"[37:37] me018 | Sorry , Robert did what ?"
[37:38] me018 | Robert took what ?
"[37:41] mn014 | which we used for the SmartKom data collection , for the synthesis ."
[37:44] me018 | Uh - huh .
[37:44] mn014 | And so he took it to Germany
[37:47] me018 | Oh .
[37:49] me018 | Is he gone now ?
[37:50] mn014 | No . He 's just gone to a SmartKom workshop .
[37:50] me018 | Oh .
"[37:53] me018 | Oh , oh . Oh , OK ."
"[37:54] mn014 | And so , we have now the SUN in the library which can do that ."
[37:57] me018 | Ah .
"[38:03] mn014 | to Liz , and it seems that"
[38:05] mn014 | it 's quite
[38:06] mn014 | s
"[38:06] mn014 | what she wants , but we 'll"
"[38:08] mn014 | have to think about the the energy thing uh , what we wanna do ."
[38:10] me013 | Right .
"[38:11] me013 | This was a business about , uh ,"
"[38:13] me013 | um ,"
[38:15] me013 | coming up with something that that was purely prosodic .
[38:18] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:18] me013 | And so , uh , we 're just gonna"
"[38:20] me013 | use a pitch detector , drive a synthesizer , and"
"[38:23] me013 | since it doesn't have a hook in it for , uh , modifying energy , we 'll have a little"
[38:27] me013 | box at the output that 'll modify the energy .
[38:29] mn017 | Hmm .
[38:29] me018 | Hmm .
[38:36] me018 | Are you are you interfacing to that thing with the C - plus - plus routines ?
[38:40] me018 | Or are you is there another interface that you use ?
[38:42] mn014 | For w for Festival ?
[38:43] me018 | Yeah .
"[38:44] mn014 | Uh , you can just use it from the Yeah ."
"[38:47] mn014 | Basically from the command line , and the defining the phones , whatever you want to have synthesized , and"
[38:51] me018 | Oh .
"[38:53] mn014 | give the F - zero targets , and then ts"
"[38:55] mn014 | get gives out a a waveform , and I I want to manipulate the the waveform , then ."
[38:58] me018 | I see .
"[39:00] me018 | Oh , that 's neat ."
[39:06] mn017 | Hmm .
[39:08] me013 | Digits ?
[39:17] me018 | Ah . OK .
[43:14] me013 | That 's all folks .

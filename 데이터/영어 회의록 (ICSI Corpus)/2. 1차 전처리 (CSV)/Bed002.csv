[00:05] me003 | I guess .
"[00:06] me011 | OK , we 're on ."
"[00:10] me011 | So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on ,"
[00:12] me011 | if you 're wearing a wireless .
[00:12] me003 | Check one . Check one .
"[00:18] me011 | And you should be able to see which one which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change ."
[00:26] me011 | Yep .
"[00:31] me011 | So , actually , if you guys wanna go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright ."
[00:35] me003 | Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?
[00:37] me011 | No .
"[00:37] me003 | Oh , OK ."
[00:45] me011 | To try to read them while everyone else is .
[00:46] me003 | Everyone would need extreme focus .
"[00:48] me011 | So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on ."
[00:52] me010 | We m
[00:53] me010 | We may wind up with ver
[00:54] me010 | We we may need versions of all this garbage .
[00:57] mn015 | For our stuff . Yeah .
[00:58] me010 | Yeah .
[00:58] me011 | Um .
[00:59] me011 | So the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on . So .
[01:02] me011 | You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ?
[01:06] me011 | So you would just read that one .
[01:08] me011 | And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines .
"[01:12] me011 | And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes ."
[01:30] me011 | stuff before everyone 's here .
"[01:33] me010 | Mmm . Well , we have one more coming ."
"[01:36] me011 | Well , why don't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there ."
"[02:21] me010 | OK . Well , we can start doing it ."
"[05:27] me011 | So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're"
"[05:30] me011 | doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth ,"
"[05:34] me011 | and then , at the corner ."
"[05:36] me011 | And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds ,"
"[05:39] me011 | so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike ."
[05:41] me011 | Um .
"[05:43] me011 | Yeah , that 's good ."
"[05:46] me011 | So , everyone needs to fill out ,"
"[05:53] me011 | I mean , you should read the consent form , but"
"[05:55] me011 | uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity"
[05:58] me011 | to edit a all the transcripts .
"[06:00] me011 | So , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public ,"
"[06:04] me011 | which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them ,"
"[06:08] me011 | uh ,"
"[06:09] me011 | you 'll be given an opportunity by email ,"
"[06:11] me011 | uh , to bleep out any portions you don't like ."
[06:14] me011 | Um .
[06:15] me011 | On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can .
"[06:19] me011 | If you 're not exactly sure about the region ,"
"[06:21] me011 | we 're not exactly sure either . So , don't worry too much about it . The It 's just self rating ."
[06:26] me011 | Um .
[06:28] me011 | And I think that 's about it .
"[06:33] me010 | Um , yeah . No . There was there was Let 's see ."
[06:36] me003 | Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?
[06:38] me010 | She got an emai she was notified .
[06:38] mn015 | I sent an email .
"[06:40] me003 | Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah ."
[06:41] me010 | Whether she knows is another question .
[06:44] me010 | Um .
[06:47] me010 | So are the people going to be identified by name ?
"[06:50] me011 | Well , what we 're gonna we 'll anonymize it in the transcript ."
[06:53] me010 | Right .
"[06:53] me011 | Um , but not in the audio ."
"[06:55] me010 | OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about ,"
[06:55] me011 | So the
"[06:58] me010 | uh , excising"
"[07:00] me010 | things from the transcript , it 's unlikely ."
[07:02] me010 | Since it it does isn't attributed .
"[07:06] me011 | Right , so if I said , "" Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? "" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the "" Jerry ""s ."
[07:08] me010 | Yeah .
[07:11] me010 | Sure .
"[07:12] me011 | Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight ."
[07:17] me010 | Right .
[07:18] me010 | Right .
"[07:19] me011 | Um , but uh ,"
"[07:21] me011 | um , it w uh , I don't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data ."
[07:24] me010 | OK .
"[07:28] me010 | Mm - hmm . No , I I wasn't complaining , I just wanted to understand ."
[07:30] me011 | Yep .
[07:31] me011 | Right .
[07:31] me010 | OK .
"[07:32] mn015 | Well , we can make up aliases for each of us ."
"[07:35] me011 | Yeah , I mean , whatever you wanna do is fine , but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible ."
[07:35] me010 | Right .
"[07:40] me011 | So , we 're trying to do real meetings ."
[07:42] me011 | And so we don't wanna have to do aliases and we don't want people to be editing what they say .
[07:42] me010 | Right .
[07:44] mn015 | Right .
[07:46] me010 | Right .
[07:46] me011 | So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . You know ?
[07:51] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[07:52] me010 | Right .
"[07:54] me010 | Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly"
[07:56] me010 | your give give your e normal schpiel .
[07:56] me011 | OK . So th
[07:58] me011 | Um .
[07:59] me011 | So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um .
[08:04] me011 | So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future .
"[08:07] me011 | This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood ."
"[08:12] me011 | The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting ,"
"[08:16] me011 | and record it ,"
"[08:17] me011 | and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting ."
"[08:20] me011 | So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings ."
[08:25] me011 | Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings .
"[08:28] me011 | Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data ."
[08:32] me011 | And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both
"[08:36] me011 | the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes ,"
[08:40] me011 | as well as the close talking mikes .
"[08:42] me011 | What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth ,"
"[08:46] me011 | gives us , um , high quality audio ,"
"[08:48] me011 | um , especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language ,"
[08:54] me011 | we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available .
"[08:58] me011 | And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition ."
[09:03] me011 | Um .
"[09:04] me011 | And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results ."
[09:08] me011 | So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two .
[09:12] me011 | So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time .
"[09:17] me011 | And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that ."
"[09:27] me011 | Our intention is to release this data to the public ,"
"[09:30] me011 | um , probably through f through a body like the LDC ."
"[09:33] me011 | And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus ."
[09:37] me011 | Um .
"[09:42] me011 | with UW ,"
[09:43] me011 | Um .
[09:44] me011 | NIST has started an effort which will include video .
"[09:46] me011 | We 're not including video , obviously ."
"[09:50] me011 | and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM ."
[09:53] me011 | Is also involved .
"[09:55] me011 | Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um ."
"[10:01] me011 | So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings"
"[10:09] me011 | to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a"
"[10:14] me011 | common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made ."
[10:20] me010 | OK .
[10:21] me011 | Anything else ?
[10:22] me010 | No .
"[10:23] me011 | OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already ."
[10:27] me011 | Um .
"[10:28] me011 | Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent ."
"[10:37] mn015 | I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , so you will have to leave what you set ."
[10:40] me011 | Yeah .
[10:41] me011 | Right .
"[10:42] me011 | And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over ."
[10:43] me010 | Yep .
[10:46] me011 | And I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n
"[10:49] me011 | Uh , but I 'm not gonna be on so don't have them use this one ."
[10:58] mn015 | Yeah . There we go .
"[10:59] me010 | By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh ,"
[11:02] mn015 | Yep .
[11:11] me010 | Organization .
"[11:12] me010 | So you guys who got email about this oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to ."
[11:17] me003 | No .
[11:17] me012 | No .
[11:21] mn015 | I got it .
[11:23] me003 | What was the nature of the email ?
"[11:27] me010 | um , inferring intentions from features in context ,"
"[11:32] me010 | and the words , like "" s go to see "" , or "" visit "" , or some"
[11:37] me010 | You didn't get it ?
[11:38] me003 | I don't think I did .
[11:40] me010 | I guess these g have got better filters .
[11:41] me010 | Cuz I sent it to everybody .
[11:43] me010 | You just blew it off . OK .
[11:43] me003 | Ah .
[11:46] mn015 | It 's really simple though . So this is the idea .
[11:48] mn015 | Um .
"[11:50] mn015 | We could pursue ,"
"[11:52] mn015 | um ,"
"[11:54] mn015 | if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , uh , I think we we will agree on that ,"
"[11:59] mn015 | um , to come up with a with a sort of very , very first crude prototype ,"
"[12:04] mn015 | and do some implementation work , and do some some research , and some modeling . So the idea is"
"[12:09] mn015 | if you want to go somewhere ,"
[12:20] mn015 | That 's the Powder - Tower .
"[12:22] mn015 | Now , um ,"
"[12:27] mn015 | data and from experiments , that"
[12:30] mn015 | there 's three things you can do .
"[12:33] mn015 | Um ,"
[12:34] mn015 | you can walk
"[12:36] mn015 | this way ,"
"[12:37] mn015 | and come really , really close to it ."
[12:39] mn015 | And touch it .
"[12:41] mn015 | But you cannot enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing ,"
[12:45] mn015 | it won't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it .
"[12:50] mn015 | If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth ."
[12:57] mn015 | If you actually want to see
"[13:00] mn015 | the tower ,"
"[13:07] mn015 | you have to go this way , and go up here ."
"[13:10] mn015 | And there you have a vre really view It exploded , the during the Thirty - years - war . Really uh , interesting sight ."
[13:17] me003 | Mmm .
"[13:17] mn015 | And um ,"
"[13:20] mn015 | these lines are , um , paths , or so"
"[13:22] mn015 | That 's ab er , i"
[13:23] mn015 | the street network of our geographic information system .
[13:27] mn015 | And you can tell that we
[13:28] mn015 | deliberately cut out this part .
[13:30] mn015 | Because otherwise we couldn't get our GIS system to take to lead people this way .
"[13:35] mn015 | It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good ."
"[13:46] mn015 | what we found interesting is , first of all ,"
[13:49] mn015 | intentions differ .
[13:51] mn015 | Maybe you want to enter a building .
"[13:54] mn015 | Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it ."
[13:58] mn015 | Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be .
[14:03] me003 | What 's it what 's it made out of ?
[14:10] me003 | So maybe you would wanna touch it .
"[14:11] mn015 | Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um ."
"[14:17] mn015 | These intentions , we w w we could ,"
"[14:20] mn015 | if we want to ,"
"[14:20] mn015 | call it the the Vista mode ,"
"[14:26] mn015 | the Enter mode ,"
"[14:28] mn015 | and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with with silly names . So this "" Tango "" means , literally translated , "" to touch "" ."
"[14:46] mn015 | If you don't have the intention of entering your building ,"
"[14:49] mn015 | but you know that something is really close to it ,"
"[14:52] mn015 | and you just want to approach it , or get to that building ."
"[14:55] mn015 | Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code ."
[15:01] mn015 | So the entrance could be miles away
[15:04] mn015 | from the closest point .
[15:06] mn015 | So sometimes it m
[15:07] mn015 | m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there .
"[15:10] mn015 | So , um ,"
"[15:12] mn015 | I 've looked , uh , through"
"[15:18] mn015 | um , and there there 's uh , a lot more different"
"[15:22] mn015 | ways in people uh , the ways people phrase how to g"
[15:26] mn015 | if they want to get to a certain place .
"[15:38] me010 | No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone ."
[15:40] fe004 | OK .
[15:43] mn015 | You need to sign some stuff and read some digits .
"[15:44] me010 | Well , you can sign afterwards ."
[15:46] mn015 | O or later .
[15:46] me003 | You have to al also have to read some digits .
[15:48] me010 | Afterwards .
"[15:56] fe004 | OK , go ahead ."
[15:59] mn015 | They are uncomfortable .
[16:01] fe004 | @ @ Small ?
[16:02] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[16:03] fe004 | Really small ? OK . I see .
[16:05] fe004 | OK .
[16:08] fe004 | Thank you .
"[16:10] me010 | And it it it it it also has to be switched on , Nance ."
"[16:13] me003 | No , that one 's already on , I thought he said . Yeah ."
"[16:14] me010 | It 's on ? OK , good ."
[16:15] fe004 | OK . It 's on .
[16:23] mn015 | Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it .
[16:28] mn015 | That 's something we found .
[16:29] mn015 | It 's just a truism .
[16:31] mn015 | And the places where you will lead them for these intentions
"[16:43] mn015 | So , this is sort of how people may , uh may phrase those requests to a a a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it ."
"[16:51] mn015 | And we get tons of of these "" how do I get to "" , "" I want to go to "" , but also , "" give me directions to "" , and "" I would like to see "" ."
"[17:00] mn015 | And um ,"
"[17:12] mn015 | First of all ,"
[17:15] mn015 | I 've completely forgot that when we talked .
"[17:17] mn015 | This is of course a crucial factor , "" what type of object is it ? """
"[17:21] mn015 | So , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of ."
[17:25] mn015 | Or very rarely .
[17:27] mn015 | But you usually want to enter them .
"[17:30] mn015 | Some objects are more picturesque ,"
[17:37] mn015 | the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants .
[17:42] mn015 | Um .
"[17:43] mn015 | Sometimes I found in the Uh , looking at the data ,"
"[17:49] mn015 | that m may also give us a hint , um ,"
"[17:52] mn015 | "" I 'm trying to get to """
"[17:54] mn015 | Nuh ? "" I need to get to "" ."
[17:55] mn015 | Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really
[17:58] mn015 | sightseeing and and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on .
[18:02] mn015 | And this leads us straight to the context
[18:05] mn015 | which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter
[18:17] mn015 | My suggestion is really simple .
"[18:22] mn015 | Now ,"
"[18:23] mn015 | Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these ."
"[18:31] mn015 | So , basically all of these things will result in the same"
[18:35] mn015 | XML M - three - L structure .
"[18:38] mn015 | Sort of action "" go "" , and then an object . Yeah ? and a source . So it 's it 's it 's way too crude to d"
[18:40] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[18:46] mn015 | capture those differences in intentions .
"[18:49] mn015 | So , I thought , "" Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . """
"[18:55] mn015 | Where we can start it and n sort of look "" OK , we need , we gonna get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse ."
[19:04] mn015 | Interpreted input .
"[19:06] mn015 | We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries ."
"[19:15] mn015 | We 'll see . And I will try to to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context ."
"[19:25] mn015 | So this is not something which we can actually monitor ,"
[19:30] mn015 | but just is something we can set .
"[19:33] mn015 | And then you can all imagine sort of a a constrained satisfaction program , depending on on what , um , comes out ."
[19:41] mn015 | We want to have an a structure resulting
[19:44] mn015 | if we feed it through a belief - net or or something along those lines .
"[19:49] mn015 | We 'd get an inferred intention , we we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the ,"
"[19:56] mn015 | um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to"
[20:00] mn015 | ignore . But .
[20:02] mn015 | That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion .
"[20:04] mn015 | We can change all of it , any bit of it ."
[20:08] mn015 | Throw it all away .
"[20:11] me012 | Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually ."
[20:13] me010 | What ?
[20:14] me010 | OK .
"[20:16] me003 | Huh . Still , I have no"
[20:18] me003 | recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check .
[20:21] me010 | Not important .
"[20:23] me010 | So , what is important is that we"
[20:27] me010 | understand what the proposed task
[20:30] me010 | is .
"[20:31] me010 | And , the the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday ."
[20:36] me010 | And
[20:38] me010 | we think it 's well - formed .
"[20:40] me010 | So we think it 's a well - formed ,"
"[20:42] me010 | uh , starter task for this ,"
"[20:45] me010 | uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain ."
"[20:57] me010 | Well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it ."
"[21:00] me010 | So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is ,"
[21:03] me010 | everywhere .
"[21:04] me010 | Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep ."
"[21:10] me010 | But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing ."
"[21:17] me010 | And , so that 's that 's the quote "" deep "" that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that"
[21:24] me010 | the current front - end
"[21:28] me010 | doesn't give you any way to Not only doesn't it do it ,"
"[21:32] me010 | but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it . It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you ,"
"[21:39] me010 | and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on ."
"[21:45] me010 | So ,"
"[21:46] me010 | uh , and this is Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gonna be contextual things , there 're gonna be linguistic things , there 're gonna be discourse things ,"
[21:53] me010 | and they gotta be combined .
"[21:56] me010 | And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better ."
"[22:04] me010 | Um ,"
[22:05] me010 | the idea would be that
"[22:07] me010 | you , uh ,"
[22:14] me010 | You 're editing your slide ?
"[22:15] mn015 | Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh ."
[22:19] me010 | Oh .
"[22:21] mn015 | So , discourse I I I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there ."
"[22:25] me010 | Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes taking minutes as we go ,"
[22:29] mn015 | Yep .
"[22:31] me010 | Um , but the p the Anyway . So the thing is ,"
"[22:35] me010 | naively speaking ,"
"[22:38] me010 | for this little task , a belief - net ,"
"[22:39] me010 | which is going to have as output ,"
"[22:42] me010 | the conditional pr probability of one of three things ,"
"[22:45] me010 | that the person wants to uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it ."
[22:53] me010 | Um .
[22:54] me010 | So that the the output of the belief - net is
[22:57] me010 | pretty well formed .
"[22:58] me010 | And , then the inputs"
[23:01] me010 | are going to be these kinds of things .
"[23:09] me010 | information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ?"
[23:12] me010 | So what are the conditional probabilities
"[23:15] me010 | of this , that , and the other , given these things ?"
[23:17] me010 | And you probably need intermediate nodes . I we don't know what they are yet .
"[23:21] me010 | So it may well be that , uh , for example ,"
"[23:29] me010 | Oh , another thing you want"
[23:31] me010 | is some information
"[23:34] me010 | abou I think ,"
[23:35] me010 | about the time of day .
"[23:37] me010 | Now , they may wanna call that part of context ."
[23:39] me010 | But the time of day matters a lot .
[23:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:42] me010 | And , if things are obviously closed ,"
"[23:46] me010 | then ,"
[23:47] mn015 | People won't want to enter it .
[23:48] me010 | Pe - people don't wanna enter them .
"[23:50] me010 | And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually"
[23:51] mn015 | s b
"[23:55] me010 | uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it ."
"[24:02] me010 | So another thing that can come up ,"
"[24:03] me010 | and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is ,"
[24:06] me010 | that another option of course is to
[24:10] me010 | have a more of a dialogue .
[24:12] me010 | So if someone says something you could ask them .
[24:14] me003 | Yeah .
"[24:15] me010 | OK . And Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring ."
[24:20] me010 | And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it .
"[24:23] me010 | So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , "" whenever you got a question like that I 've got"
"[24:27] me010 | one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . """
"[24:30] me010 | OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do ."
"[24:34] mn015 | But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call ."
"[24:38] me010 | Oh yeah . You want the you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you don't wanna do is"
"[24:44] me010 | onl build a system that always asks every time , and i"
[24:49] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:50] me010 | In general you 're you know ,"
[24:52] me010 | it 's gonna be much more complex than that .
[24:54] me010 | a This is purposely a really simple case .
"[25:00] mn015 | I have one more point to to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we"
"[25:09] mn015 | um , want it in terms of"
"[25:11] mn015 | our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from"
"[25:14] mn015 | human beings , model that , its motions ,"
"[25:16] mn015 | going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives ."
[25:25] mn015 | That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding .
[25:27] me010 | Yeah .
"[25:28] me010 | S so so the way that might come up ,"
"[25:30] me010 | if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say ,"
"[25:33] me010 | "" Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal"
"[25:38] me010 | schema involved ? """
"[25:40] me010 | OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something ."
"[25:48] me010 | And that could be , uh ,"
"[25:56] me010 | In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter ."
"[26:00] me012 | So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ?"
[26:03] me010 | No .
"[26:04] me010 | No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th What he was saying is ,"
"[26:06] me010 | the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying ,"
[26:09] me012 | Right .
"[26:12] me010 | "" A person wants to go to a place . """
[26:13] me003 | The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ?
[26:16] me010 | Right .
[26:16] me003 | OK .
"[26:16] me010 | M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language ."
"[26:18] me003 | It 's just a language . Right , yeah ."
[26:20] me010 | So we have th w we we
[26:26] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:29] me010 | Well , OK ."
[26:32] me010 | Yeah .
"[26:32] mn015 | o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gonna get ."
"[26:35] me010 | Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha Anyway ."
[26:37] mn015 | In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis . They call it intention hypotheses .
[26:41] me010 | Right .
"[26:41] me010 | So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh or We can assume that y you get this crude information ."
"[26:50] me010 | About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide ."
"[26:54] me010 | And they don't give you the kind of object , they don't give you"
"[26:58] me010 | any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else ."
"[27:04] mn015 | Well , they keep it . We have to request it ."
[27:06] me010 | Right .
[27:07] mn015 | Nuh ?
[27:07] mn015 | But it 's not in there .
"[27:07] me010 | Well , they they kee they keep it by their lights . It may it may or may not"
[27:10] mn015 | Hmm .
"[27:11] mn015 | Yeah , or i"
"[27:14] me003 | So , if someone says , "" I wanna touch the side of the Powder - Tower "" ,"
[27:25] me003 | and the directions ?
"[27:25] me010 | If i if Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah . But it wouldn't ."
[27:27] me003 | Yeah .
[27:28] me003 | OK .
[27:33] me003 | But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for
"[27:37] me003 | touching the side , right ?"
"[27:39] mn015 | Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ?"
"[27:46] mn015 | because um ,"
[27:48] mn015 | sometimes people just say
"[27:51] mn015 | things This you find very often . "" Where is the city hall ? """
[27:56] mn015 | And this do
"[27:57] mn015 | they don't wanna sh see it on a map , or they don't wanna know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the your north . They wanna go there ."
"[28:04] mn015 | That 's what they say , is , "" Where is it ? "" ."
[28:07] mn015 | Where is that damn thing ?
"[28:11] mn015 | Well , that 's"
[28:12] mn015 | a a question mark . sh
"[28:13] mn015 | A lot of parsers , um ,"
"[28:18] mn015 | That 's way beyond their scope , is of interpreting that . You know ?"
"[28:22] mn015 | But um ,"
"[28:23] mn015 | still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure ,"
"[28:28] mn015 | with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it ,"
[28:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:38] me003 | I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output ,"
[28:38] me010 | Yeah .
[28:40] me003 | depending on these things .
"[28:43] mn015 | Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and and shows it to you on a map ."
"[28:53] mn015 | Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where where it is ."
"[29:06] fe004 | Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , "" Where 's the city hall ? "" ,"
"[29:09] fe004 | I might say , g ar "" Are you trying to get there ? """
[29:11] fe004 | Because how I describe
"[29:13] fe004 | um , t its location uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or"
[29:14] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:19] fe004 | say , you know , whatever , "" It 's half a mile away "" or something like that ."
"[29:21] mn015 | It 's a granularity factor , because where people ask you , "" Where is New York ? "" , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast ."
[29:21] me010 | Yeah .
[29:23] fe004 | Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly .
[29:25] fe004 | Right .
"[29:26] mn015 | Y y eh you won't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah ."
[29:26] fe004 | Right .
[29:28] fe004 | Yeah .
[29:31] fe004 | Right .
"[29:31] mn015 | But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there ."
[29:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[29:35] mn015 | So th
[29:36] mn015 | They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well . So .
[29:37] fe004 | Right . Right .
"[29:43] me010 | i Go go back to the the uh , th"
"[29:45] mn015 | So I w this is "" onto "" is is knowledge about buildings , their opening times ,"
"[29:50] mn015 | and then t coupled with time of day ,"
"[29:53] mn015 | um ,"
"[29:55] fe004 | So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel ,"
"[30:01] fe004 | as well as the utterance context , like , "" I 'm now standing at this place at this time "" ."
"[30:05] me010 | Yeah , well I think we ought to d"
"[30:06] me010 | a As we have all along , d"
[30:08] me010 | We we 've been distu
"[30:09] me010 | distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context ,"
"[30:13] me010 | and discourse context , which you have as DH , I don't know what the H means ."
[30:14] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[30:16] mn015 | Nuh .
[30:17] mn015 | History .
[30:18] mn015 | Discourse history .
[30:19] me010 | OK .
[30:19] me010 | Whatever .
[30:19] mn015 | Yeah .
[30:20] me010 | So we can work out terminology later .
[30:21] mn015 | Yep .
"[30:22] me010 | So , they 're they 're quite distinct ."
"[30:25] me010 | I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct ."
"[30:27] me010 | And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot ,"
[30:32] me010 | is not doing any of the linguistics .
[30:38] me010 | Except to find out what seems to be useful .
"[30:42] me010 | So , the the the reason the belief - net is in blue ,"
"[30:48] me010 | Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is"
"[30:51] me010 | to take as a first goal ,"
[30:53] me010 | see if we could actually build a belief - net
[30:56] me010 | that would make this three way distinction
"[30:59] me010 | uh , in a plausible way , given"
"[31:02] me010 | these We have all these transcripts and we 're able to ,"
"[31:08] me010 | by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , "" Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you"
"[31:18] me010 | which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . """
"[31:23] me010 | And if to actually do that , build it , um you know , run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe"
[31:31] me010 | the parameters .
[31:32] me010 | And see how that goes .
"[31:34] me010 | If that goes well ,"
[31:37] me010 | then we can start worrying about how we would
[31:40] me010 | extract them .
[31:41] me010 | So where would you get this information ?
"[31:43] me010 | And , expand it to to other things like this ."
"[31:47] me010 | But if we can't do that ,"
[31:51] me010 | then we 're in trouble .
"[31:52] me010 | I mean th th i i if you can't do this task ,"
"[31:59] me010 | Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but"
"[32:06] me010 | I don't think that 's gonna be the case . I think that ,"
"[32:08] me010 | uh , if we can get the information ,"
[32:11] me010 | a belief - net is a perfectly good way of
[32:14] me010 | doing the
[32:16] me010 | inferential combination of it .
"[32:19] me010 | The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ?"
[32:26] me010 | And I don't know .
"[32:31] mn015 | But , only w"
[32:32] me010 | Hold on a s Hold on a second .
[32:33] mn015 | Muh .
"[32:33] me010 | So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?"
[32:40] me012 | Yep .
"[32:45] fe004 | Um , I missed the beginning , but , um"
"[32:54] fe004 | These are all factors that uh , a"
[32:57] fe004 | These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to
[33:01] fe004 | take into account ? You were saying
[33:03] fe004 | n
[33:03] me010 | Take them into account .
[33:04] fe004 | Take the the linguistic factors too .
[33:04] me010 | But but you don't worry about h
"[33:05] fe004 | Oh , how to extract these features . OK ."
[33:06] me010 | how to extract them .
"[33:07] me010 | So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,"
[33:08] fe004 | Got it .
[33:11] fe004 | OK .
"[33:11] fe004 | And and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case ."
[33:16] me010 | No .
[33:16] fe004 | But l
[33:17] fe004 | OK . That 's that 's the thing I 'm curious ab
[33:18] me010 | Let 's go back to th
[33:18] me010 | Let 's go back to the the the slide of data .
[33:25] mn015 | Not from that data .
"[33:26] mn015 | But , um , since we are designing"
[33:32] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:33] mn015 | um , we will definitely take care to put it in there ,"
[33:36] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[33:36] mn015 | in some
"[33:37] mn015 | shape , way , form over the other ,"
[33:39] mn015 | to see whether
[33:39] fe004 | Right .
"[33:40] mn015 | we can , then , get"
[33:41] mn015 | sort of empirically validated data .
"[33:50] mn015 | s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ?"
[33:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:54] mn015 | But it doesn't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still you know ?"
[33:56] fe004 | Right .
[33:57] fe004 | Right .
[33:58] mn015 | But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net .
[34:02] fe004 | Right .
"[34:02] mn015 | So , um , this is exactly what Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , "" Well , if it 's phrased like that ,"
[34:07] fe004 | Sure .
"[34:16] fe004 | u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task ."
"[34:21] fe004 | Right ? Where you have where your , uh , current"
[34:23] mn015 | We -
[34:26] fe004 | So you will know .
[34:28] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[34:28] me010 | Yeah .
"[34:31] fe004 | The No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from"
[34:32] me010 | Yeah .
[34:34] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:34] me010 | From that task , yeah . So ,"
"[34:36] me010 | uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room"
[34:40] me010 | and start recording subjects
"[34:43] me010 | probably within a month or something . So ,"
[34:45] me010 | this is not
"[34:46] me010 | any lo any of you guys ' worry , except that"
[34:50] me010 | we may want to push that effort to get information we need .
[34:56] me010 | is to figure out how to solve these problems .
"[34:59] me010 | If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then"
[35:03] me010 | the sort of data collection branch
"[35:05] me010 | can be , uh , asked to do that ."
[35:08] me010 | And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help
"[35:13] me010 | when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects ."
"[35:19] me010 | So , yeah y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you you will not have ,"
"[35:25] me010 | But you know , y y"
"[35:45] mn015 | No , no . No ."
[35:51] fe004 | s using a device ?
"[35:53] mn015 | Uh ,"
"[35:54] mn015 | N no , no not i it was mobile but not not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers ."
[35:59] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[36:03] fe004 | I guess I don't know The situation of of collecting th the data of , like Here you could imagine them being walking around the city ."
[36:09] fe004 | as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other
[36:12] fe004 | c situational context factors that would influence
"[36:15] fe004 | w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that ."
[36:16] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:18] fe004 | If they 're doing it in a you know , "" I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions "" ,"
[36:21] fe004 | I I would imagine that the data would be really different .
[36:28] mn015 | It was never th th the goal of that data collection to to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not
[36:35] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:36] mn015 | differentiated by intentionality , there was n there was no label , you know , intention A , intention B , intention C . Or task A , B , C ."
[36:39] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Right .
[36:48] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:49] mn015 | that will help us along those lines . But ,"
"[36:52] mn015 | you know , you gotta leave something for other people to model ."
"[36:54] mn015 | So , to Finding out what , you know ,"
"[36:58] mn015 | situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s"
[37:03] mn015 | interesting thing .
[37:04] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:06] mn015 | u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm I 'm s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with ,"
[37:14] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[37:15] mn015 | so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need
[37:18] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:27] mn015 | Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like"
[37:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[37:38] fe004 | Hmm .
[37:39] mn015 | stuff out of it .
"[37:42] mn015 | It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment ."
"[37:46] me003 | How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map ,"
[37:49] me003 | and then you give them a scenario of some sort ?
[37:52] mn015 | OK .
"[37:54] mn015 | Imagine you 're the the subject . You 're gonna be in here , and somebody And and you see , uh ,"
"[37:59] mn015 | either th the three - D model ,"
"[38:01] mn015 | or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg ."
[38:07] mn015 | So you actually see that .
[38:09] mn015 | Um .
"[38:10] mn015 | The uh ,"
"[38:15] mn015 | So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth ."
"[38:24] mn015 | So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told"
"[38:28] mn015 | that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know ,"
[38:33] mn015 | and it understands you completely .
"[38:35] mn015 | And so you 're gonna pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve ."
"[38:40] mn015 | First you have to know find out how to get to that place ,"
[38:43] mn015 | maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there .
"[38:46] mn015 | Maybe So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild ."
[38:51] mn015 | The third one is to
[38:53] mn015 | get information on the history of an object .
[38:57] mn015 | And then the g system breaks down .
"[39:00] mn015 | It crashes ,"
[39:01] fe004 | a At the third ? Right then ?
[39:03] mn015 | After the third task .
[39:03] fe004 | OK .
[39:06] mn015 | Or after the fourth . Some find @ @ Forget that for now .
"[39:08] mn015 | And then , a human operator comes on ,"
[39:16] mn015 | now with a human operator .
"[39:18] mn015 | And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects ,"
"[39:23] mn015 | and you go through it again , and that was it ."
"[39:28] mn015 | w And uh , the computer you are you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS ."
"[39:34] mn015 | When the human operator comes on , um ,"
[39:38] mn015 | that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well .
"[39:41] mn015 | So the person first has to ask you "" Where are you ? "" ."
"[39:45] mn015 | s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there ."
"[39:49] mn015 | Um , this is a a a a a bit that I d I don't think we Did we discuss that bit ?"
"[39:55] mn015 | Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now ."
"[39:57] mn015 | But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know ."
[40:02] mn015 | So .
"[40:09] mn015 | Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a a a sort of a map type display ."
"[40:13] mn015 | Uh , two - D ."
[40:15] mn015 | n
[40:16] mn015 | Two - D .
[40:19] mn015 | Yeah . b y
[40:19] fe004 | for themselves
[40:20] fe004 | @ @ there .
"[40:22] mn015 | I don't know . I but y I don't think you really move ,"
[40:25] fe004 | OK . So
[40:25] mn015 | sort of . Yeah ?
"[40:26] mn015 | I mean that would be an an an enormous technical effort ,"
[40:30] mn015 | unless we
"[40:32] mn015 | We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there ."
[40:36] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[40:39] mn015 | Maybe we wanna do that . Yeah .
"[40:42] fe004 | Uh , I was just trying to figure out how how ambitious the system is ."
"[40:52] mn015 | So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that ."
[40:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[40:56] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:01] fe004 | I mean , uh yo you 're told So when your task is , I don't know , "" Go buy stamps "" or something like that ?"
"[41:08] fe004 | Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w"
"[41:15] mn015 | Well , we 'll see what people do ."
"[41:16] fe004 | There 's no OK , so it 's just like , "" Let 's figure out what they would say"
"[41:19] fe004 | under the circumstances "" ."
[41:22] fe004 | Uh - huh . Uh - huh .
"[41:23] mn015 | I mean , in both cases it 's gonna be a human , in the"
"[41:26] mn015 | computer , and in the operator case ."
"[41:28] mn015 | And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ?"
[41:32] fe004 | Yep .
[41:34] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:41] mn015 | But um ,"
"[41:43] mn015 | maybe the maybe what you 're suggesting Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t"
"[41:51] mn015 | uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wanna m have it more more steps , sort of ?"
"[41:58] fe004 | Yeah , I I don't know how much direction is given to the subject"
[42:00] fe004 | about what
"[42:01] fe004 | their interaction I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . All they know is it 's this great system that could do"
[42:06] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[42:08] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:09] me010 | Oh yeah , but to some extent this is a different discussion ."
[42:12] me010 | OK ? So .
"[42:13] me010 | Uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff"
[42:15] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[42:18] me010 | and we do have , um , a student who"
[42:24] me010 | is a candidate for wizard .
"[42:26] me010 | Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's ."
"[42:33] fe004 | Oh , Fey Parrill . Yeah . Uh - huh ."
[42:34] me010 | You know her ?
[42:36] me010 | OK . Sh - Is sh
"[42:37] fe004 | She started taking the class last year and then didn't um , you know , didn't continue . I g She 's a g"
"[42:43] fe004 | Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK ."
[42:43] me010 | She 's graduated .
[42:45] me010 | Yeah .
"[42:46] fe004 | Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in"
[42:51] me010 | OK .
[42:51] fe004 | aspect and stuff like that .
"[42:51] me010 | So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school ."
[42:57] me010 | And she 'll be in touch . So we may have
"[42:59] me010 | someone ,"
"[43:00] me010 | uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in in"
"[43:05] me010 | all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So ."
[43:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:15] me010 | exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go ."
"[43:18] me010 | And um ,"
"[43:20] me010 | Jane , but also , uh , Liz"
[43:24] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:24] me010 | have offered to help us do this ,"
[43:25] fe004 | Mmm .
"[43:26] me010 | uh , data collection and design and stuff ."
"[43:29] me010 | So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing ."
[43:29] fe004 | OK .
"[43:34] fe004 | I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um ,"
"[43:39] fe004 | it 's one thing to collect data for , I don't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear"
"[43:50] fe004 | I 'm not really sure , um ,"
[43:53] fe004 | how how e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy
"[44:00] me003 | Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ?"
"[44:05] me003 | Like ,"
"[44:09] me003 | Yeah , I just wasn't sure to what level of detail the task was ."
"[44:13] mn015 | Mm - hmm . n No one is , at the moment ."
[44:13] fe004 | Right .
[44:15] fe004 | Right .
[44:15] me003 | OK .
"[44:16] me010 | So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out ."
[44:17] fe004 | Right .
[44:19] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:19] me010 | But , uh ,"
"[44:24] me010 | The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was ,"
"[44:27] me010 | let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other ,"
"[44:33] me010 | you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and"
[44:39] me010 | know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data .
[44:44] me010 | Um .
"[44:45] me010 | The issue is , can we"
"[44:48] me010 | find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that ,"
"[44:54] me010 | uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the ,"
"[45:01] me010 | in this case three little intentions ,"
[45:04] me010 | are
[45:05] me010 | most likely .
[45:13] mn015 | To come as close as possible to it .
"[45:15] fe004 | Yeah , it 's @ @ ."
[45:18] me010 | To v
[45:18] fe004 | OK .
[45:19] me010 | to View it .
[45:21] me010 | OK ? To Enter it .
[45:23] me010 | Now those It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct .
"[45:26] me010 | "" Take a picture of it """
[45:27] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[45:28] me010 | you you might well want to be a really rather different place than
[45:30] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[45:31] me010 | entering it .
"[45:32] me010 | And , for an object that 's at all big ,"
[45:32] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:35] me010 | uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it"
[45:38] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:38] me010 | uh , could be quite different than either of those ."
[45:40] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:42] fe004 | OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode ."
"[45:45] me003 | See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz ."
"[45:49] mn015 | To "" Waltz "" it ?"
[45:52] me010 | Well .
"[45:59] me012 | like , do you wanna try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ?"
[46:01] me010 | Right .
[46:05] me010 | Right .
[46:06] me012 | certain construction or whatever .
"[46:07] me010 | Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or"
"[46:11] me010 | w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context ."
"[46:18] me010 | So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not ,"
"[46:25] me010 | Now , how you determine that"
"[46:27] me010 | is another issue . But fo for the current problem ,"
"[46:30] me010 | it would just be , "" OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , """
"[46:35] me010 | or something ,"
"[46:37] me010 | uh , that would give you"
"[46:43] me010 | Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,"
[46:45] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:46] me010 | and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run ,"
[46:49] me010 | you would figure out how you could derive them .
[46:55] me012 | Right .
[46:55] me010 | From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .
"[47:12] me010 | OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys ,"
"[47:17] me010 | you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ?"
[47:22] me012 | Oh .
"[47:24] me012 | No , not really ."
"[47:25] me010 | OK . Well , anyway . f Get one ."
"[47:27] me010 | OK ? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually ,"
"[47:31] me010 | uh , pick a package ,"
"[47:33] me010 | doesn't matter which one ,"
"[47:34] me010 | uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d"
"[47:39] me010 | You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive ,"
"[47:41] me010 | uh , belief - nets quickly . d w"
[47:43] me010 | These are not gonna get big in in the foreseeable future .
[47:47] me010 | But we do want one
"[47:48] me010 | in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify ."
"[47:54] me010 | Because i that 's A lot of what it 's gonna be , is ,"
"[47:57] me010 | um ,"
"[47:59] me010 | playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have ,"
"[48:10] me010 | OK ? So we make up cases that have these features ,"
[48:16] me010 | There 're even ones tha that you can do learning
[48:20] me010 | OK ? So you have all their cases and and their results and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you .
"[48:28] me010 | Um ,"
[48:30] me010 | probably that 's not worth it .
"[48:32] me010 | I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make"
[48:35] me010 | the these data fitting ones
"[48:38] me010 | worth it , but I don't know ."
"[48:40] me010 | So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package ."
"[48:51] me010 | And , as soon as we have one , we can start"
[48:53] mn015 | An - Nuh .
"[48:55] me010 | trying to ,"
"[48:57] me010 | uh ,"
[48:58] me010 | make a first cut
[49:01] me010 | at what 's going on .
[49:02] me010 | But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete .
"[49:04] me010 | OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be , and we have some some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition ,"
"[49:12] me010 | and see how hard it is ,"
"[49:14] me010 | and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need ."
"[49:23] me010 | You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net ."
[49:28] me010 | That 'd be really interesting .
[49:29] me003 | Mm - hmm .
[49:32] mn015 | And it and it may serve as a platform for
"[49:36] mn015 | a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis ."
"[49:41] mn015 | I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already ,"
"[49:49] mn015 | that are contained in the data ,"
"[49:51] mn015 | um ,"
"[49:52] mn015 | you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um ,"
"[49:56] mn015 | maybe even means of s uh , extracting them ."
"[49:59] mn015 | And and that altogether could also be uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it ."
[50:07] mn015 | When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ?
"[50:13] me010 | No , th It turns out that there is a ,"
"[50:17] me010 | The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called JavaBayes. Which is"
[50:21] mn015 | Mmm . OK .
[50:22] me010 | one that fair people around here use a fair amount .
"[50:27] me010 | The obvious advantage of that is that you can then ,"
"[50:31] me010 | relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do . So that i that 's I think why"
[50:35] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[50:39] me010 | a lot of people doing research use that .
[50:42] me010 | But it may not be I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and
"[50:46] me010 | there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh ,"
[50:54] fe004 | There 's the m
"[50:55] fe004 | tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed ,"
[50:57] me010 | Right .
[50:58] me010 | It 's OK .
[50:58] fe004 | which might be useful too . And it 's available Matlab code .
[50:59] me012 | Right .
"[50:59] me010 | So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with ."
[51:05] mn015 | Mm - hmm . But i
"[51:06] me012 | Yeah , I know him ."
[51:07] me010 | Yeah .
"[51:12] mn015 | For example ,"
"[51:13] mn015 | this th th the dialogue history is is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML ."
"[51:19] mn015 | And the ontology that um , uh the student is is constructing for me back in in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML ."
"[51:29] mn015 | And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gonna come from ."
[51:33] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[51:34] me010 | Yeah .
"[51:35] mn015 | Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able We can couple ."
[51:40] me010 | Yeah .
"[51:41] me010 | So , yeah , we 're sort of committed to XML as the kind of ,"
"[51:44] me010 | uh , interchange ."
"[51:46] me010 | But that 's , you know , not a big deal ."
"[51:47] mn015 | Who isn't , nuh ?"
"[51:48] me010 | So , in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build ,"
[51:54] me010 | It 'll be XML .
"[51:55] me010 | And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface ."
"[52:02] me010 | But that 's that 's fine an and um ,"
[52:05] me010 | all of these things have been built
[52:08] me010 | with
[52:10] me010 | much bigger projects than this in mind . So they they
[52:13] me010 | have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth .
"[52:20] me010 | So ,"
[52:22] me010 | that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .
"[52:26] me010 | I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work ,"
"[52:31] me010 | in a way that we 're comfortable with ,"
"[52:33] me010 | then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML ,"
"[52:37] me010 | um , little descriptors ."
[52:41] mn015 | Hmm . Yeah .
"[52:41] mn015 | Yeah , I like , for example , the what you said about the"
"[52:44] mn015 | getting input from from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth ."
"[52:51] mn015 | That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML ."
"[52:53] me010 | Uh , you could have an X yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure ."
[52:58] mn015 | So r
"[52:59] me010 | um ,"
"[53:01] me010 | you know , feature value XML format"
[53:02] me010 | is probably as good a way as any .
"[53:06] me010 | So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth ,"
"[53:09] me010 | um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that"
"[53:13] me010 | um ,"
[53:14] me010 | do things you 'd like .
[53:16] me012 | Doesn't does SmartKom system have such packages ?
[53:18] mn015 | Yeah .
[53:18] me010 | Sure .
[53:19] mn015 | The the lib M - three - L library does that .
"[53:21] me010 | And the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l"
[53:23] me010 | We 'll have to l
[53:30] mn015 | What I What sort of came to my mind i is was the notion of an idea that
[53:33] me010 | Yeah .
"[53:34] mn015 | if if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um ,"
"[53:44] mn015 | which is in file format ,"
"[53:47] mn015 | um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made and , for example , if if they are in in MATE ,"
"[53:56] mn015 | then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level ."
[54:00] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:03] mn015 | Um , Michael has a project where you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so"
[54:10] mn015 | So if we w
"[54:11] mn015 | if we think it 's worth it one of these days ,"
"[54:14] mn015 | not not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that ,"
[54:17] me012 | Right .
[54:22] mn015 | that 'd be nice .
"[54:23] me010 | It 'd be nice , but but I I I do I don't wanna count on it ."
"[54:30] me010 | that the data will come , and you don't have to actually design the nets ."
[54:36] mn015 | I I think we should devote m
"[54:46] me010 | You know , you don't really like it ."
[54:48] me010 | So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use
"[54:51] me010 | their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey ."
[54:57] me012 | Right .
"[54:58] me010 | Um ,"
"[55:02] me010 | It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally ."
[55:17] mn015 | Two days ?
[55:19] me010 | Huh ?
"[55:19] mn015 | Two , three days ?"
"[55:23] me010 | have y guys , uh , you know , pick"
[55:29] mn015 | No .
[55:33] me012 | Sure .
"[55:34] me010 | And , then as soon as we have it ,"
[55:37] me010 | I think we should start
[55:39] me010 | trying to
[55:41] me010 | populate it for this problem .
"[55:43] me010 | Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on ,"
[55:46] me010 | and probably the ea
[55:48] me010 | easiest way to do that
[55:50] me010 | is
"[55:52] me010 | some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site or You know , how"
"[55:56] mn015 | Uh I I I um , OK , I t"
"[56:02] me010 | OK , I wasn't ."
"[56:04] mn015 | Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . But um ,"
[56:05] me010 | Yeah .
"[56:10] mn015 | maybe it might be interesting if if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that ."
"[56:19] me010 | Well , y Well , or both of them speak . We don't care ."
[56:20] me012 | Sure .
"[56:21] mn015 | Yeah , or you can split it up ."
"[56:23] mn015 | So , y"
[56:24] me012 | Hmm .
"[56:33] me010 | Well , I 'd like to also ,"
"[56:35] me010 | though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the"
[56:39] me010 | belief - net looks like .
[56:40] me010 | Even if it 's really crude .
"[56:43] me010 | OK ? So , you know ,"
[56:46] me010 | Right . Yeah .
[56:47] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:50] me010 | And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is ,"
"[56:53] me010 | I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could ,"
"[56:57] me010 | uh , in the meeting , say , you know , "" Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , """
"[57:02] me010 | uh , you know , "" What other ideas do you have ? """
[57:06] me010 | and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file .
"[57:12] me010 | Of ,"
"[57:13] me010 | uh , you know , get a t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , "" These are"
"[57:19] me010 | the various scenarios we 've experienced . """
[57:24] me010 | this file of them and when you
"[57:25] me010 | think you 've got a better belief - net ,"
[57:32] me010 | this data file .
"[57:34] me012 | So we 'll be like , hand , uh ,"
[57:36] me012 | doing all the probabilities .
[57:38] me012 | OK .
"[57:38] me010 | Oh , yeah , unt until we know more ."
[57:46] me003 | Changing the table so that the system works in English ?
"[57:50] mn015 | Whi - while you were doing this ,"
[57:51] mn015 | I received two lovely emails . The the full NT and the full Linux version are
[57:57] mn015 | there .
"[57:58] mn015 | I 've downloaded them both ,"
"[58:04] mn015 | Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I can't really unpack it because it contains a future date ."
[58:18] mn015 | Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine .
[58:24] mn015 | And so that we have it .
"[58:31] mn015 | Hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along ,"
[58:38] mn015 | we I control p
[58:40] mn015 | Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show
[58:43] me010 | Yeah .
[58:44] mn015 | that .
"[58:45] me010 | Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are ,"
"[58:49] me010 | at the moment ,"
[58:50] me010 | separate .
"[58:52] me010 | Uh , what one hopes is that"
"[58:55] me010 | when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both"
[58:59] me010 | worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .
"[59:10] me010 | Oh , yeah . I don't know . n None of this is i n"
[59:14] me010 | Neither of these projects
"[59:16] me010 | has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable ."
[59:21] me003 | OK .
"[59:21] me010 | OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic ."
"[59:25] me010 | If if you know , if we don't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around ,"
"[59:32] me010 | you know , wasting time ,"
"[59:35] me010 | You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things ."
[59:39] me003 | OK .
"[59:47] mn015 | that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful ,"
"[59:53] mn015 | um , state where"
"[59:55] mn015 | we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German ,"
"[00:02] mn015 | but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , "" OK , this is what it usually does ,"
"[00:07] mn015 | and now we add this little thing to it "" ,"
"[00:14] mn015 | and we plug it in ,"
"[00:15] mn015 | and then for these certain tasks ,"
"[00:17] mn015 | and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system ,"
[00:22] mn015 | it all all of a sudden it does much better .
[00:24] mn015 | Nuh ? Because it can
"[00:26] mn015 | produce better answers ,"
"[00:27] mn015 | tell the person , as I s showed you on this map ,"
"[00:30] mn015 | n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door ,"
[00:38] mn015 | which would be great .
"[00:40] mn015 | So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it"
[00:46] mn015 | takes the person where it wants to go .
[00:48] mn015 | Rather than taking him
"[00:51] mn015 | always to the geometric center of a building , which is what they do now ."
[00:52] me012 | Mmm .
[00:56] mn015 | And we even had to take out a bit .
"[00:58] mn015 | Nancy , you missed that part ."
[00:59] mn015 | We had to take out a bit of the road
[01:01] mn015 | work . So that it doesn't take you to the wall
"[01:10] mn015 | So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered ,"
[01:15] mn015 | because car navigation systems don't really care .
"[01:17] mn015 | You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number ."
[01:20] fe004 | Hmm .
[01:22] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[01:22] mn015 | But even that is problematic . If you go d
"[01:25] mn015 | If you wanna drive to the SAP in Waldorf ,"
"[01:27] mn015 | I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft ,"
"[01:30] mn015 | the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah ,"
[01:34] mn015 | you are miles away from the entrance .
[01:36] me010 | Yep .
[01:37] mn015 | Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere .
[01:41] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[01:41] mn015 | Nuh ? but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .
[01:46] mn015 | So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .
"[01:51] me010 | Probably not then , cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway ."
[01:54] mn015 | Probably neither e not even that .
[01:54] me010 | Yeah .
[02:03] me010 | Clear ?
[02:12] me003 | The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone .
[02:17] mn015 | Do you wanna see a picture ?
[02:18] me003 | Sure !
[02:20] mn015 | Have to reboot for that though .
[02:20] fe004 | Um .
"[02:22] fe004 | So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are are you gl will you be doing Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by"
[02:29] fe004 | thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ?
[02:32] me010 | Of course they use the sample data .
[02:35] fe004 | Is there a lot s of sample data that
[02:36] fe004 | is beyond what you what you have there ?
"[02:36] mn015 | There there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and and to see whether"
"[02:46] mn015 | there are features in there that can be extracted , and to come up with some"
[02:47] fe004 | Yeah .
[02:48] fe004 | Right .
[02:50] mn015 | features that are not
"[02:52] mn015 | you know , empirically based on on a real experiment or on on on reality but sort of on your intuition of you know , "" Aha !"
[02:54] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[03:01] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[03:04] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[03:09] me003 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:11] me012 | So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of"
"[03:14] me012 | start thinking about that , hopefully ."
[03:17] mn015 | Yep .
"[03:32] me010 | Uh , is that OK ?"
[03:32] mn015 | Well they had they used the ammunition They stored the ammunition in that tower .
[03:36] me010 | Alright .
"[03:36] mn015 | And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded ."
[03:40] me010 | Oh . Ni -
[03:40] me003 | It exploded .
[03:45] me003 | That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower .
[03:47] mn015 | Ahh .
[03:47] me003 | OK .
"[03:52] fe004 | That 's right , OK ."
[04:40] mn015 | Mmm .

"[00:05] fn002 | Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week ."
[00:10] me013 | Yeah .
[00:11] fn002 | Well eh you know that I work I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice .
[00:18] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[00:19] fn002 | What I trying two MLP
[00:23] fn002 | to to the with this new feature and the fifteen feature
[00:29] fn002 | uh from the
[00:32] fn002 | eh bus base system
[00:35] me018 | The the mel cepstrum ?
"[00:37] fn002 | No , satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum , the new base system the new base system ."
"[00:43] me018 | Oh the OK , the Aurora system ."
"[00:43] fn002 | Yeah , we yeah the Aurora system with the new filter ,"
[00:45] me018 | OK .
"[00:49] fn002 | VAD or something like that . And I 'm trying two MLP , one"
"[00:55] fn002 | one that only have t three output , voice , unvoice , and silence , and"
[01:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[01:01] fn002 | other one that have fifty - six output .
[01:05] fn002 | The probabilities of the allophone . And
[01:10] fn002 | I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that
[01:13] fn002 | and only have result with with the MLP with the three output .
[01:19] fn002 | And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output .
"[01:23] fn002 | And , well , the result are"
"[01:29] me013 | Uh , I I 'm I 'm slightly confused . What what feeds the uh the three - output net ?"
[01:29] me018 | Hmm .
"[01:34] fn002 | Voice , unvoice , and si"
"[01:36] me013 | No no , what feeds it ? What features does it see ?"
[01:37] fn002 | The feature the input ?
[01:39] fn002 | The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh
[01:45] fn002 | bases feature .
[01:47] me013 | Uh - huh .
[01:47] fn002 | the with the new code .
"[01:49] fn002 | And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum ,"
[01:56] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[01:57] fn002 | the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero and also R - zero ,"
[01:59] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:03] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:05] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:06] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[02:09] fn002 | the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function . That is like the energy
[02:13] me013 | Right .
"[02:14] fn002 | with these three feature , also these three feature ."
[02:17] me013 | You wouldn't do like R - one over R - zero or something like that ?
"[02:22] me013 | I mean usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do yeah , you 'd do something you 'd do energy but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like R - one ov over R - zero or something like that ."
[02:23] fn002 | Yeah .
[02:32] me018 | What are the R 's ?
[02:33] me018 | I 'm sorry I missed it .
[02:34] me013 | R correlations .
"[02:35] fn002 | No , R c No ."
[02:35] me018 | Oh .
"[02:37] fn002 | Auto - correlation ? Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that @ @"
[02:38] me013 | Ye -
"[02:41] me013 | Well that 's the variance , but if you just say "" what is "" I mean , to first order ,"
"[02:45] me013 | um yeah one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy ."
[02:49] me013 | Another one is but the other one is the spectral shape .
"[02:52] fn002 | The spectral shape , yeah ."
"[02:53] me013 | Yeah , and so R - one over R - zero is what you typically use for that ."
"[02:58] me013 | No , I 'm saying that 's what people us typically use ."
[03:01] fn002 | Mmm .
"[03:03] me013 | See , because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you"
[03:07] me013 | um
"[03:08] me013 | "" does the spectrum look like that or does it look like that "" ."
[03:09] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[03:12] me013 | Right ?
[03:13] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[03:13] me013 | So if it 's if it 's um if it 's low energy uh but the but the spectrum looks
"[03:20] me013 | like that or like that ,"
[03:22] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[03:22] me013 | it 's probably silence .
"[03:24] me013 | Uh but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that ,"
[03:27] me013 | it 's probably unvoiced .
[03:29] fn002 | Yeah .
[03:30] me013 | So if you just if you just had to pick
"[03:31] me013 | two features to determine voiced - unvoiced ,"
"[03:34] me013 | you 'd pick something about the spectrum like uh R - one over R - zero ,"
"[03:39] fn002 | Mm - hmm , OK ."
[03:40] me013 | um and R - zero
[03:43] me013 | or i i you know you 'd have some other energy measure and like in the old days people did like uh zero crossing
[03:50] me013 | counts .
"[03:50] fn002 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[03:51] me013 | Right . S Yeah . Um ,"
"[03:52] fn002 | Well , I can also th use this ."
[03:57] fn002 | Bec - because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that
[04:01] me013 | Yeah .
[04:03] fn002 | everything is more or less the similar more or less similar .
[04:06] me013 | But um
[04:07] fn002 | It 's not quite better .
"[04:09] me013 | Right , but it seemed to me that what you were"
[04:12] me013 | what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what and the variance was one take uh on it .
"[04:25] fn002 | Yeah , I used this too ."
"[04:27] me013 | Right . But it it could be something else . Suppose you didn't have anything like that . Then in that case , if you have two nets ,"
"[04:36] me013 | Alright , and this one has three outputs ,"
[04:39] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[04:40] me013 | and this one has f
"[04:41] me013 | whatever , fifty - six , or something , if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one ."
[04:43] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[04:55] me013 | So just having the three output thing doesn't doesn't really buy you anything .
[04:59] fn002 | Yeah .
[05:00] me013 | The issue is what you feed it .
"[05:03] fn002 | Yeah , I have yeah ."
[05:06] me013 | So uh
"[05:06] me018 | So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one ,"
[05:12] me013 | w
[05:14] me013 | W well that 's another way . That wasn't what I was saying but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do . No I was just trying to say if you b if you
[05:14] fn002 | Yeah .
"[05:20] me013 | bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?"
[05:24] me018 | Mmm .
[05:25] me013 | And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um
[05:31] me013 | based on whether you feed it something different .
"[05:34] me013 | And something different in some fundamental way . And so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before ,"
[05:43] me013 | something
[05:45] me013 | uh about the difference between the the uh um
[05:50] me013 | log FFT uh log power uh
[05:54] me013 | and the log magnitude uh F F - spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank .
[06:01] fn002 | Yeah .
[06:02] me013 | And so the filter bank
"[06:05] me013 | is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch and she 's saying you know trying So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference ,"
[06:15] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[06:16] me013 | but that might not be the right number .
"[06:19] me013 | Right ? I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough or maybe there 's something else that that one could use , but"
"[06:26] me013 | I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here , so here 's here 's an idea ."
"[06:33] me013 | uh What about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?"
[06:44] fn002 | Ah I 'm sorry .
[06:45] me013 | This is f
"[06:46] me013 | You have the log magnitude spectrum ,"
[06:47] fn002 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[06:48] me013 | and you were looking at that
[06:49] me013 | and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance .
[06:52] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[06:53] me013 | That 's a clever thing to do . What if you stopped being clever ?
[06:56] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[06:56] me013 | And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful and
"[07:01] me013 | figure out what they can what they most need from things , and"
[07:05] fn002 | Yeah .
[07:05] me013 | I mean that 's what they 're good at .
"[07:08] me013 | So I mean you 're you 're you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should we should get about this difference but uh in fact ,"
[07:18] me018 | Hmm .
[07:19] me013 | or feeding both of them in
"[07:21] me013 | you know , another way , saying let it figure out what 's the what is the"
"[07:25] me013 | interaction , especially if you do this over multiple frames ?"
[07:27] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:28] me013 | Then you have this over time ,"
[07:30] me013 | and and both kinds of measures and uh you might get uh something better .
[07:37] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[07:38] me013 | Um .
"[07:41] me018 | don't do the division , but let the net"
[07:44] me018 | have everything .
[07:45] me013 | That 's another thing you could do yeah . Yeah .
[07:46] fn002 | Yeah .
[07:48] me013 | Um .
"[07:51] me013 | I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication ."
[08:01] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[08:02] me013 | I mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into a net
[08:07] me013 | and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle and train it to get the product of the output and it would work .
"[08:13] me013 | But , it 's kind of crazy , cuz we know how to multiply and you you 'd be you know much lower error usually if you just multiplied it out ."
[08:21] me013 | But suppose you don't really know what the right thing is . And that 's what these sort of dumb machine learning methods are good at . So .
[08:30] me013 | Um . Anyway . It 's just a thought .
"[08:31] me018 | How long does it take , Carmen , to train up one of these nets ?"
"[08:35] fn002 | Oh , not too much ."
[08:36] me018 | Yeah .
"[08:37] fn002 | Mmm , one day or less ."
[08:38] me018 | Hmm .
"[08:40] me013 | Yeah , it 's probably worth it ."
[08:42] me006 | What are what are your f uh frame error rates for for this ?
[08:45] fn002 | Eh fifty - f six
"[08:47] fn002 | uh no , the frame error rate ? Fifty - six I think ."
[08:51] me006 | O
[08:53] me013 | Is that maybe that 's accuracy ?
[08:53] fn002 | Percent .
[08:55] fn002 | The accuracy .
[08:55] me006 | Fif - fifty - six percent accurate for v voice - unvoice
[08:57] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:59] fn002 | No for , yes f"
"[09:01] fn002 | I don't remember for voice - unvoice , maybe for the other one ."
"[09:02] me006 | Oh , OK ."
"[09:04] me013 | Yeah , voiced - unvoiced hopefully would be a lot better ."
[09:04] me006 | OK .
[09:04] fn002 | for voiced . I don't reme
[09:05] me006 | Should be in nineties somewhere .
[09:07] me006 | Right .
[09:09] fn002 | I can't show that .
[09:09] me006 | OK .
[09:10] fn002 | But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone .
[09:16] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[09:17] fn002 | That I look in the with the other nnn the other MLP that we have are more or less the same number .
[09:23] fn002 | Silence will be better but more or less the same .
[09:26] me013 | I think at the frame level for fifty - six that was the kind of number we were getting for for uh um reduced band width uh
"[09:35] fn002 | I think that I I I think that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty sixty - two , sixty"
[09:35] me013 | stuff .
[09:38] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[09:44] me013 | That 's all ?
[09:45] fn002 | Yeah .
[09:45] me013 | That 's pretty bad .
"[09:46] fn002 | Yeah , because it 's noise also ."
[09:49] me013 | Aha !
[09:49] me006 | Oh yeah .
[09:49] fn002 | And we have
[09:51] me013 | Aha !
[09:51] me013 | Yeah . Yeah . OK .
"[09:54] me013 | Oh yeah , in training . Still ,"
[09:57] me013 | Uh .
"[09:58] me013 | Well actually , so this is a test that you should do then ."
"[10:01] me013 | Um , if you 're getting fifty - six percent over here , uh that 's in noise also , right ?"
"[10:04] fn002 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[10:05] me013 | Oh OK .
"[10:06] me013 | If you 're getting fifty - six here ,"
[10:08] me013 | try adding together the probabilities of all of the voiced phones here and all of the unvoiced phones
[10:14] me013 | and see what you get then .
[10:15] fn002 | Yeah .
[10:16] me013 | I bet you get better than sixty - three .
[10:21] fn002 | I th I I think that we I have the result more or less . Maybe . I don't know .
[10:26] fn002 | I don't I 'm not sure but
[10:28] fn002 | I remember @ @ that I can't show that .
"[10:32] me013 | That is a a good check point , you should do that anyway , OK ?"
[10:34] fn002 | Yeah .
[10:35] me013 | Given this this uh
"[10:38] me013 | regular old net that 's just for choosing for other purposes ,"
[10:41] me013 | uh add up the probabilities of the different subclasses and see see how well you do .
[10:45] me013 | Uh and that you know anything that you do over here should be at least as good as that .
[10:50] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[10:54] fn002 | I will do that .
"[10:55] me018 | The targets for the neural net ,"
"[10:57] me018 | uh , they come from forced alignments ?"
[11:02] fn002 | no .
[11:03] me006 | TIMIT canonical ma mappings .
[11:04] fn002 | TIMIT .
[11:04] me018 | Ah !
"[11:05] me013 | Oh . So , this is trained on TIMIT ."
[11:05] me018 | OK .
[11:06] fn002 | Yeah .
"[11:07] me006 | Yeah , noisy TIMIT ."
[11:07] me013 | OK .
[11:08] fn002 | Yeah this for TIMIT .
[11:09] me013 | But noisy TIMIT ?
[11:10] fn002 | Noisy TIMIT . We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the the
[11:10] me006 | Right .
[11:14] fn002 | TI - digits . And now we have another noisy TIMIT also with the noise of uh Italian database .
[11:26] me013 | Yeah .
[11:31] me013 | some large vocabulary noisy stuff too . Somebody 's preparing .
[11:34] me018 | Really ?
[11:35] me013 | Yeah .
[11:44] me013 | preparing .
[11:45] me018 | For Aurora ?
[11:46] me013 | Yeah .
[11:47] me018 | Oh !
"[11:50] me013 | Uh ,"
"[11:51] me013 | the issue is whether people make a decision now based on what they 've already seen , or they make it later . And one of the arguments for making it later is let 's make sure"
[12:00] me013 | that whatever techniques that we 're using work for something more than than connected digits .
[12:06] me018 | Hmm .
[12:07] me013 | So .
[12:11] me018 | When would they do that ?
"[12:12] me013 | Mmm , I think late uh I think in the summer sometime ."
[12:16] me018 | Hmm .
[12:18] me013 | So .
[12:22] fn002 | This is the work that I did during this date and also mmm
[12:24] me013 | Uh - huh .
[12:28] fn002 | I H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to to study
[12:36] fn002 | well seriously the France Telecom proposal to look at the code and something like that
[12:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[12:43] fn002 | to know exactly what they are doing because maybe that we can have some ideas
[12:48] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[12:48] fn002 | but not only to read the proposal . Look insi look i
[12:54] fn002 | carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and I begin to to work also in that .
[13:01] fn002 | But the first thing that I don't understand is that they
[13:06] fn002 | are using R -
[13:08] fn002 | the uh log energy that this quite I don't know why they have some
[13:17] fn002 | constant in the expression of the lower energy . I don't know what that means .
"[13:23] me018 | They have a constant in there , you said ?"
[13:25] fn002 | Yeah .
"[13:27] me013 | Oh ,"
"[13:27] me013 | at the front it says uh "" log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two """
[13:34] fn002 | Yeah .
[13:35] me013 | Uh .
[13:37] fn002 | Then maybe I can understand .
[13:43] me013 | I I have no idea .
"[13:45] me013 | Yeah , that 's what I was thinking , but but um ,"
"[13:48] me013 | then there 's the sixty - four ,"
"[13:52] me013 | Uh ,"
"[13:55] fn002 | Because maybe they 're the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value I don't know exactly , because well th I thought maybe they have a meaning . But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value ."
[13:57] me018 | Experimental results .
[13:59] me006 | Mc - McDonald 's constant .
"[14:09] me013 | Yeah , it 's pretty funny looking ."
[14:10] me018 | So they 're taking the number inside the log and raising it to
[14:10] me013 | I don't know .
[14:14] me018 | sixteen over log
[14:16] me018 | base two .
[14:19] me013 | um
[14:21] me013 | Right .
[14:28] me013 | two .
[14:30] me013 | Um .
"[14:32] me013 | If we ignore the sixteen ,"
[14:34] me013 | the natural log of t one over the natural log of two times the natu
[14:39] me013 | I don't know .
[14:40] me018 | Hmm .
"[14:45] me013 | It may just be that they they want to have for very small energies , they want to have some"
"[14:50] fn002 | Yeah , the e"
[14:56] fn002 | to do something like that .
[14:58] fn002 | No ?
"[14:58] me013 | Well , it says , since you 're taking a natural log , it says that when when you get down to essentially zero energy ,"
[15:03] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:04] me013 | this is gonna be the natural log of one , which is zero ."
[15:07] me013 | So it 'll go down to
[15:10] me013 | uh
[15:14] me013 | So the lowest value for this would be zero . So y you 're restricted to being positive .
[15:18] me013 | And this sort of smooths it for very small energies .
"[15:21] me013 | Uh , why they chose sixty - four and something else , that was probably just experimental ."
[15:25] fn002 | Yeah .
"[15:26] me013 | And the the the constant in front of it , I have no idea ."
[15:29] me013 | um
[15:38] fn002 | Maybe they tres hole are on basis of this .
[15:41] fn002 | I don't know .
[15:44] me013 | they they probably have some fi particular
"[15:48] me018 | Yeah , I was just gonna say maybe it has something to do with hardware , something they were doing ."
"[15:51] me013 | Yeah ,"
[15:57] me013 | and so maybe that puts it in the right realm somewhere .
[16:03] me013 | Yeah .
"[16:03] me013 | I think , given at the level you 're doing things in floating point on the computer , I don't think it matters , would be my guess , but ."
[16:08] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[16:10] fn002 | I this more or less anything
[16:11] me013 | Yeah .
[16:17] fn002 | I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow .
"[16:20] me013 | Oh , he was gone these first few days , and then he 's here for a couple days before he goes to Salt Lake City . OK ."
[16:25] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[16:27] fn002 | He 's I think that he is in Las Vegas or something like that .
[16:31] me013 | Yeah .
[16:32] me013 | Yeah .
[16:32] me013 | So he 's he 's going to ICASSP which is good . I I don't know if there are many people
[16:36] me013 | who are going to ICASSP
[16:36] fn002 | Yeah .
"[16:37] me013 | so so I thought , make sure somebody go ."
[16:37] fn002 | Yeah .
[16:39] me018 | Have people sort of stopped going to ICASSP in recent years ?
"[16:43] me013 | Um ,"
[16:47] me013 | it 's still a reasonable forum
[16:49] me013 | for students to to present things .
"[16:51] me013 | Uh ,"
"[16:53] me013 | I think for engineering students of any kind , I think it 's it 's if you haven't been there much , it 's good to go to ,"
[16:59] me018 | Hmm .
[16:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:59] me013 | uh to get a feel for things , a range of things , not just speech . Uh ."
"[17:04] me013 | But I think for for sort of dyed - in - the - wool speech people , um I think that ICSLP and Eurospeech are much more targeted ."
"[17:12] me013 | Uh . And then there 's these other meetings , like HLT and and uh"
[17:15] me018 | Mmm .
[17:21] me013 | to uh
[17:23] me013 | computational uh speech processing of one sort or another .
[17:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[17:26] me013 | Um .
"[17:28] me013 | So . I mean , I mostly just ignored it because I was too busy and didn't get to it ."
[17:34] me013 | So uh
[17:40] me013 | Or anything else ?
[17:41] me006 | Yeah . So . I I guess
[17:42] me006 | some of the
"[17:43] me006 | progress , I I 've been getting a getting my committee members for the quals ."
"[17:49] me006 | And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek ,"
"[17:53] me006 | Mike Jordan ,"
[17:54] me006 | and I asked John Ohala and he agreed .
[17:56] me018 | Cool .
[17:56] me006 | Yeah . Yeah .
[17:57] me006 | So I 'm I I just need to ask um
[18:00] me006 | Malek .
[18:01] me006 | One more .
[18:02] me006 | Um .
[18:03] me006 | Tsk .
[18:03] me006 | Then uh I talked a little bit about
"[18:06] me006 | um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic events ,"
[18:11] me006 | and um
[18:13] me006 | we 're we 're we 're
[18:16] me006 | thinking about a way to test the completeness of
[18:21] me006 | a a set of um dynamic uh events .
"[18:25] me006 | Uh , completeness in the in the sense that"
"[18:27] me006 | um if we if we pick these X number of acoustic events ,"
[18:33] me006 | do they provide sufficient coverage
[18:36] me006 | for the phones that we 're trying to recognize
[18:39] me006 | or or the f the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .
[18:43] me006 | And so Morgan and I were uh discussing
[18:46] me006 | um s uh s
[18:48] me006 | a form of a cheating experiment
[18:52] me006 | um we have uh
[18:55] me006 | um
"[18:56] me006 | a chosen set of features , or acoustic events ,"
[19:00] me006 | and we train up a hybrid
[19:02] me006 | um system to do phone recognition on TIMIT .
"[19:06] me006 | So i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition results ,"
"[19:11] me006 | using um these set of acoustic events ,"
[19:15] me006 | then
[19:16] me006 | um that that says that these acoustic events are g sufficient to cover
"[19:22] me006 | a set of phones , at least found in TIMIT ."
[19:27] me006 | a measure of
"[19:31] me006 | the choices of our acoustic events "" ."
"[19:34] me006 | Um ,"
[19:35] me006 | So that 's going on . And
"[19:38] me006 | also , just"
[19:39] me006 | uh working on my
"[19:45] me013 | Actually , let me Hold that thought . Let me back up while we 're still on it . The the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features ,"
[19:46] me006 | Yeah .
"[19:46] me006 | OK , sure ."
"[19:53] me013 | uh , maybe the first thing to do is just to count"
[19:57] me013 | and uh count co - occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete HMM
"[20:03] me013 | cuz that 'd be pretty simple because it 's just Say , if you had ten ten events ,"
"[20:08] me013 | uh that you were counting , uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits ,"
"[20:15] me013 | and uh so you could make a table that would say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be a thousand by thirty - nine , and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh"
"[20:28] me013 | count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone , and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone . And um then just use that in a very simple HMM and uh"
"[20:45] me013 | you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or I mean , it 'd be on the simple side , but"
[20:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[20:55] me013 | uh
[20:56] me013 | um
"[20:59] me013 | you know , if uh uh the example I was giving was that if if you had um"
"[21:05] me013 | onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events ,"
"[21:10] me013 | then if you had those a all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely right ."
[21:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:19] me013 | So .
"[21:20] me013 | But you 'd get all the other distinctions , you know , randomly wrong . I mean there 'd be nothing to tell you that ."
[21:25] me013 | So
[21:26] me013 | um
"[21:29] me013 | If you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of events to to do the kind of level of of uh classification of phones that you 'd like ."
[21:42] me013 | So that was that was the idea . And then the other thing that we were discussing was was um
"[21:47] me013 | OK , how do you get the your training data ."
[21:50] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:51] me013 | Cuz uh the Switchboard transcription project uh uh you know was
"[21:57] me013 | half a dozen people , or so working off and on over a couple years , and"
"[22:03] me013 | uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with TIMIT training . So ,"
[22:08] me013 | it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is
[22:13] me013 | uh to automatically translate the uh
[22:18] me013 | current TIMIT markings into the markings you want .
[22:21] me013 | And uh
"[22:22] me013 | it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't"
[22:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:29] me013 | there from these automatic markings , but but uh"
[22:35] me018 | It 's probably a good place to start .
[22:36] me013 | Yeah .
[22:36] me018 | Yeah .
"[22:37] me013 | Yeah and a short short amount of time , just to again , just to see if that information is sufficient"
[22:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[22:43] me013 | to uh determine the phones .
[22:45] me018 | Hmm .
[22:46] me013 | So .
[22:49] me018 | to get an idea about
"[22:51] me018 | how different it is , you could maybe take some subset"
[22:53] me018 | and
"[22:55] me018 | you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand and then see how different it is"
[22:59] me018 | from
"[23:00] me018 | you know , the canonical ones , just to get an idea a rough idea of"
[23:00] me013 | Right .
[23:05] me018 | h if it really even makes a difference .
"[23:06] me013 | You can get a little feeling for it that way , yeah that is probably right ."
[23:07] me018 | Yeah .
"[23:09] me013 | I mean uh my my guess would be that this is since TIMIT 's read speech that this would be less of a big deal , if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more more of one ."
[23:15] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[23:18] me018 | Right .
[23:19] me018 | Right .
"[23:20] me013 | And the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , well what if you took"
[23:29] me013 | having more information doesn't tell you
[23:32] me013 | really all that much more about what the phones are .
[23:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[23:37] me018 | You could define
[23:39] me018 | other events as being sequences of these events
"[23:45] me013 | Uh , you could , but the thing is , what he 's talking about here is a uh a translation to a per - frame feature vector ,"
"[24:05] me013 | Yeah , but we 're just talking about something simple here ,"
"[24:06] me018 | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
"[24:06] me013 | yeah ,"
[24:07] me018 | Yeah .
"[24:10] me013 | Yeah . Just You know . The idea is with a with a very simple statistical structure , could you could you uh at least verify that you 've chosen features that"
[24:15] me018 | Yeah .
[24:20] me013 | are sufficient .
[24:32] me006 | Oh .
[24:33] me006 | Yeah th Um .
[24:33] me013 | Yeah .
[24:34] me006 | So for my class project I 'm
[24:36] me006 | um
[24:37] me006 | I 'm
"[24:38] me006 | tinkering with uh support vector machines ? something that we learned in class , and uh um basically just another method for doing classification ."
[24:48] me006 | And so I 'm gonna apply that to
[24:50] me006 | um compare it with the results by um King and Taylor who did
[24:54] me006 | um these
"[24:56] me006 | um using recurrent neural nets ,"
[24:58] me006 | they recognized
[25:00] me006 | um
[25:01] me006 | a set of phonological features
[25:04] me006 | um
"[25:05] me006 | and made a mapping from the MFCC 's to these phonological features , so I 'm gonna"
"[25:18] me006 | Um . So , support vector machines are are good with dealing with a less amount of data"
[25:24] me018 | Hmm .
[25:25] me006 | and um so if you if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job
[25:30] me006 | in learning the the patterns .
[25:33] me018 | Hmm .
[25:34] me006 | Um and
[25:36] me006 | um
"[25:37] me013 | I guess it yeah , they 're sort of succinct ,"
[25:39] me013 | and and they
[25:40] me006 | Yeah .
[25:40] me013 | uh
[25:47] me018 | for cla what do they do for classification ?
"[25:50] me006 | Um . Right . So ,"
[25:52] me006 | the the simple idea behind a support vector machine is
"[25:56] me006 | um ,"
"[25:58] me006 | you have this feature space , right ? and then it finds the optimal separating plane ,"
[25:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:06] me006 | um between these two different um classes ,"
[26:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:10] me006 | and um
[26:13] me006 | and so
"[26:14] me006 | um ,"
"[26:15] me006 | what it i at the end of the day , what it actually does is"
[26:18] me006 | it picks
[26:19] me006 | those
"[26:20] me006 | examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary , and remembers those"
[26:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[26:27] me006 | and uses them to recreate the boundary for the test set .
"[26:32] me006 | So , given these"
"[26:33] me006 | um these features , or or these these examples ,"
"[26:39] me006 | which they call support f support vectors ,"
[26:42] me018 | Oh .
[26:42] me006 | then um
"[26:44] me006 | given a new example ,"
[26:45] me006 | if the new example falls
[26:47] me006 | um away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being a part of this particular class
[26:54] me006 | and otherwise it 's the other class .
[26:56] me018 | So why save the examples ? Why not just save what the
[26:59] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[27:00] me018 | boundary itself is ?
[27:02] me006 | Um . Hmm . Let 's see .
"[27:12] me006 | Yeah , that 's a good question . I yeah ."
[27:14] me013 | That 's another way of doing it .
[27:15] me018 | Mmm .
[27:17] me018 | Sort of an equivalent .
"[27:18] me013 | You know , it it goes back to nearest - neighbor sort of thing , right ? Um ,"
[27:21] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:22] me013 | i i if is it eh w
"[27:25] me013 | When is nearest - neighbor good ? Well , nearest - neighbor good is good if you have lots and lots of examples ."
"[27:31] me013 | Um but of course if you have lots and lots of examples , then it can take a while to to use nearest - neighbor . There 's lots of look ups ."
[27:39] me013 | So a long time ago people talked about things where you would have
"[27:43] me013 | uh a condensed nearest - neighbor , where you would you would you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent to to correctly classify everything that came in ."
[27:45] me018 | Oh .
[27:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[27:57] me013 | to that kind of thing .
[27:58] me018 | I see .
[27:58] me013 | Um .
"[27:59] me018 | So rather than doing nearest neighbor where you compare to every single one ,"
[28:03] me018 | you just pick a few
[28:06] me013 | Yeah .
[28:06] me018 | Hmm .
[28:07] me013 | And th the
"[28:08] me013 | You know , um"
"[28:19] me013 | you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameters and then you you place them as you best can to define the boundaries , and in fact , as you know ,"
[28:26] me013 | these things do take a lot of parameters and and uh
"[28:30] me013 | if you have uh only a modest amount of data , you have trouble"
[28:34] me013 | uh learning them .
"[28:35] me013 | Um ,"
[28:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[28:35] me013 | so I I guess the idea to this is that it it is reputed to uh be somewhat better in that regard .
[28:42] me006 | Right . I it can be a a reduced um parameterization of of the the model by just keeping certain selected examples .
[28:52] me018 | Hmm .
[28:53] me006 | Yeah .
[28:54] me006 | So .
[28:54] me013 | But I don't know if people have done sort of careful
[28:57] me013 | comparisons of this on large tasks or anything .
[29:01] me013 | Maybe maybe they have .
[29:02] me013 | I don't know .
"[29:03] me006 | Yeah , I don't know either ."
[29:04] me013 | Yeah .
[29:05] me026 | S do you get some kind of
[29:07] me026 | number between zero and one at the output ?
[29:09] me006 | Actually you don't get a you don't get a nice number between zero and one . You get you get either a zero or a one .
"[29:16] me006 | Um ,"
[29:17] me006 | uh there are there are pap
[29:22] me006 | you you get a distance measure
"[29:24] me006 | at the end of the day ,"
[29:28] me006 | is translated to a zero or one .
[29:30] me006 | Um .
"[29:31] me013 | But that 's looking at it for for classification for binary classification , right ?"
"[29:34] me006 | That 's for classification , right ."
"[29:35] me018 | And you get that for each class , you get a zero or a one ."
[29:39] me006 | Right .
[29:39] me013 | But you have the distances to work with .
"[29:41] me006 | You have the distances to work with , yeah ."
[29:42] me013 | Cuz actually Mississippi State people did use support vector machines for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probabilities .
[29:45] me006 | Yeah .
[29:51] me006 | they had a had a way to translate the distances into into probabilities with the with the simple
[29:58] me006 | um
[29:59] me006 | uh sigmoidal function .
"[30:06] me006 | Yeah , there 's some there 's like one over one plus the exponential or something like that ."
[30:09] me013 | Oh it i
"[30:10] me013 | Oh , so it is a sigmoidal ."
[30:11] me006 | Yeah .
[30:11] me013 | OK .
[30:13] me013 | Alright .
[30:14] me018 | Did the did they get
[30:16] me018 | good results with that ?
"[30:17] me013 | I mean , they 're OK , I I don't I don't think they were earth earth shattering , but I think that"
[30:21] me018 | Hmm .
[30:22] me013 | uh
"[30:23] me013 | this was a couple years ago , I remember them doing it at some meeting , and and um"
[30:30] me013 | to try this and
[30:33] me018 | Hmm .
"[30:34] me013 | so the you know , the numbers were not"
"[30:36] me013 | incredibly good but there 's you know ,"
[30:38] me013 | it was th reasonable .
[30:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[30:40] me013 | I I don't remember anymore .
"[30:41] me013 | I don't even remember what the task was ,"
"[30:43] me013 | it was Broadcast News , or"
[30:45] me013 | something . I don't know .
[30:46] me018 | Hmm .
[30:47] me006 | Right .
"[30:47] me026 | Uh s So Barry , if you just have zero and ones , how are you doing the speech recognition ?"
[30:52] me006 | Oh I 'm not do I 'm not planning on doing speech recognition with it . I 'm just doing
[30:55] me026 | Oh . OK .
[30:56] me006 | detection of phonological features .
"[30:58] me006 | So uh for example ,"
[31:00] me006 | this this uh feature set called the uh sound patterns of English
[31:04] me006 | um is just a bunch of
[31:07] me006 | um
[31:08] me006 | binary valued features .
"[31:10] me006 | Let 's say , is this voicing , or is this not voicing , is this"
"[31:14] me006 | sonorants , not sonorants , and"
[31:16] me026 | OK .
[31:16] me006 | stuff like that . So .
[31:17] me018 | Did you find any more mistakes in their tables ?
"[31:27] me006 | Is the mapping from N to to this phonological feature called um "" coronal "" ,"
[31:43] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[31:46] me013 | But a as I was saying , people do get probabilities from these things , and and uh"
[31:48] me026 | OK .
"[31:50] me013 | we were just trying to remember how they do , but people have used it for speech recognition , and they have gotten probabilities . So they have some conversion from these distances to"
[31:57] me026 | OK . OK . OK .
[31:58] me013 | probabilities .
"[31:58] me006 | Right , yeah ."
"[32:00] me013 | There 's you have you have the paper , right ? The Mississippi State paper ?"
[32:02] me006 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[32:03] me013 | Yeah , if you 're interested y you could look , yeah ."
[32:04] me026 | And OK . OK .
"[32:08] me018 | So in your in in the thing that you 're doing , uh"
[32:10] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[32:11] me018 | you have a vector of ones and zeros for each phone ?
[32:17] me018 | Yeah .
[32:18] me006 | OK .
[32:19] me006 | um
"[32:22] me006 | Right , right f so for every phone there is there is a um a vector of ones and zeros"
[32:30] me006 | f uh corresponding to whether it exhibits a particular phonological feature or not .
[32:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:35] me018 | And so when you do your wh I 'm what is the task for the class project ? To
[32:41] me006 | Um
"[32:45] me006 | Right , um to come up with a mapping from um MFCC 's or s some feature set ,"
[32:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:53] me006 | um to
[32:56] me006 | to whether there 's existence of a particular phonological feature .
"[33:03] me006 | And um yeah , basically it 's to learn a mapping"
[33:08] me006 | from the MFCC 's to
[33:11] me006 | uh phonological features .
[33:14] me006 | Is it did that answer your question ?
[33:16] me018 | I think so .
[33:17] me006 | OK .
[33:21] me018 | I 'm not sure what you what you 're what you get out of your system . Do you get out a
[33:26] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[33:37] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[33:38] me006 | it 's it 's basically it 's it 's really simple , basically a detection"
[33:42] me006 | of phonological features .
[33:45] me018 | I see .
"[33:45] me006 | Yeah , and um"
[33:49] me006 | So King and and Taylor
[33:51] me018 | Yeah .
"[33:51] me006 | um did this with uh recurrent neural nets , and this i their their idea was to first find"
[33:54] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[33:59] me006 | a mapping from MFCC 's to
"[34:01] me006 | uh phonological features and then later on , once you have these"
"[34:05] me006 | phonological features ,"
[34:07] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[34:07] me006 | then uh map that to phones . So I 'm I 'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff .
[34:10] me018 | Mmm .
[34:12] me018 | So they had one recurrent net for each particular feature ?
[34:16] me006 | Right .
[34:17] me006 | Right .
[34:17] me018 | I see .
[34:17] me006 | Right .
[34:18] me006 | Right .
"[34:20] me018 | I wo did they compare that I mean , what if you just did phone recognition and did the reverse lookup ."
[34:26] me006 | Uh .
"[34:26] me018 | So you recognize a phone and which ever phone was recognized , you spit out it 's vector of ones and zeros ."
[34:33] me013 | I expect you could do that . That 's probably not what he 's going to do on his class project .
[34:34] me006 | Uh .
[34:36] me013 | Yeah .
[34:39] me013 | So um have you had a chance to do
[34:39] me006 | Yeah .
[34:46] me013 | um
[34:53] me013 | the um
[34:54] me013 | changes to the data in comparing PLP and mel cepstrum
[35:00] me013 | for the SRI
[35:03] me013 | system .
[35:05] me018 | Uh .
[35:10] me013 | Right .
[35:12] me018 | Yeah .
[35:14] me013 | of a few percent
[35:14] me018 | Right .
[35:15] me013 | and
[35:16] me013 | you told me that there was a difference in how the normalization was done .
[35:23] me013 | redo it
[35:24] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[35:24] me013 | uh for PLP with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum .
[35:29] me018 | Uh
"[35:30] me018 | right , no I haven't had a chance to do that ."
[35:31] me018 | What I 've been doing is
[35:32] me013 | OK .
[35:41] me018 | because
[35:42] me018 | the difference
[35:45] me018 | it 's not gigantic
[35:47] me018 | but it 's big enough that it it seems wrong .
"[35:49] me013 | Yeah , I agree , but I thought that the normalization difference was one of the"
"[35:54] me013 | possibilities , right ?"
"[35:54] me018 | Yeah , I guess I don't"
[35:59] me018 | So what I was working on is um
[35:59] me013 | OK .
"[36:02] me018 | just going through and checking the headers of the wavefiles , to see if"
[36:08] me018 | a certain type of compression or something that was done that my script wasn't catching . So that for some subset of
"[36:15] me018 | the training data ,"
[36:17] me018 | the features I was computing were junk .
[36:19] me013 | OK .
[36:20] me018 | Which would you know
"[36:21] me018 | cause it to perform OK , but uh ,"
"[36:23] me018 | you know , the the models would be all messed up . So I was going through and just double - checking that kind of think first ,"
[36:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[36:28] me018 | to see if
[36:29] me018 | there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features .
[36:29] me013 | I see .
[36:32] me013 | OK .
[36:36] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:39] me013 | Yeah , that makes sense , to check all that ."
"[36:45] me013 | Although really ,"
[36:45] me013 | uh
"[36:46] me013 | uh , a couple three percent"
[36:48] me013 | uh difference in word error rate
[36:51] me013 | could easily come
"[36:52] me013 | from some difference in normalization , I would think ."
[36:55] me013 | But
"[36:56] me018 | Yeah , and I think , hhh I 'm trying to remember but I think I recall that Andreas was saying that he was gonna run"
[37:01] me018 | sort of the reverse experiment .
[37:04] me018 | Uh
[37:05] me018 | which is to
[37:07] me018 | try to
[37:09] me018 | emulate the
[37:11] me018 | normalization that we did but with the mel cepstral features .
"[37:15] me018 | Sort of , you know ,"
[37:17] me018 | back up from the system that he had .
[37:20] me018 | I thought he said he was gonna I have to look back through my my email from him .
"[37:23] me013 | Yeah , he 's probably off at at uh his"
"[37:24] me018 | Yeah , he 's gone"
"[37:25] me013 | meeting now ,"
[37:25] me018 | now .
[37:26] me018 | Um .
[37:26] me013 | yeah .
[37:27] me013 | Yeah .
[37:28] me013 | But yeah the I sh think they should be
"[37:30] me013 | roughly equivalent ,"
[37:33] me013 | I mean again
[37:34] me013 | the Cambridge folk found the PLP actually to be a little better .
[37:38] me018 | Right .
[37:38] me013 | Uh
[37:40] me013 | um
[37:43] me013 | the bootstrapping of
[37:45] me013 | their system which was
[37:51] me018 | I was looking I 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created .
[37:57] me018 | And um
"[38:01] me018 | S R I system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly ,"
[38:06] me018 | uh
[38:07] me013 | Right .
[38:07] me018 | and does all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly .
[38:11] me013 | Right .
"[38:11] me018 | And ,"
"[38:14] me018 | where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that I can go look at and compare"
"[38:18] me018 | to the PLP ones , so"
"[38:20] me018 | whereas with our features , he 's actually storing"
[38:24] me013 | Right .
"[38:29] me018 | uh even though the cepstrum is already computed , he has to give it"
[38:32] me018 | uh
[38:34] me018 | a front - end parameter file . Which talks about the kind of
[38:38] me018 | uh
"[38:40] me018 | com computation that his mel cepstrum thing does , so"
[38:41] me013 | Uh - huh .
[38:44] me018 | i
"[38:44] me018 | I I don't know if that it probably doesn't mess it up , it probably just ignores it if it determines that it 's already"
[38:52] me018 | the the the two processes that happen are a little different .
[38:55] me018 | So .
[38:55] me013 | Yeah .
"[38:56] me013 | So anyway , there 's stuff there to sort out ."
[38:57] me018 | Yeah .
[38:57] me018 | Yeah .
[39:01] me018 | Yeah no and I didn't have a chance to do that .
[39:09] me018 | I 've been working with um
[39:10] me018 | Jeremy
[39:11] me018 | on his project and then I 've been trying to track down this bug
[39:14] me018 | in uh the ICSI front - end features .
[39:21] me018 | the uh RASTA code
[39:23] me018 | and it looks like we don't have any way to um
"[39:28] me018 | control the frequency range that we use in our analysis . We basically it looks to me like we do the FFT , um and then we just take all the bins"
[39:38] me018 | and we use everything .
[39:39] me018 | We don't have any set of parameters where we can say
"[39:42] me018 | you know , "" only process from"
"[39:44] me018 | you know a hundred and ten hertz to thirty - seven - fifty "" ."
[39:48] me018 | At least I couldn't see any kind of control for that .
"[39:49] me013 | Yeah , I don't think it 's in there , I think it 's in the uh uh"
[39:53] me013 | uh the filters .
"[39:55] me013 | So , the F F T is on everything , but the filters"
"[39:59] me013 | um , for instance , ignore the the lowest"
[40:04] me013 | bins
[40:05] me013 | and the highest bins .
[40:07] me013 | And what it does is it it copies
[40:09] me018 | The the filters ? Which filters ?
[40:11] me013 | um
[40:12] me013 | The filter bank which is created by integrating over F F T bins .
[40:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[40:17] me013 | um
[40:20] me018 | When you go to the mel scale .
[40:20] me013 | Right .
[40:23] me013 | it actually copies
[40:28] me013 | the second
[40:30] me013 | filters over to the first . So the first filters are always and you can s you can specify a different number of
"[40:36] me013 | uh features different number of filters , I think ,"
[40:39] me013 | as I recall .
"[40:41] me013 | So you can specify a different number of filters , and whatever"
[40:45] me013 | um
"[40:46] me013 | uh you specify , the last ones are gonna be ignored . So that that 's a way that you sort of"
[40:52] me013 | change what the what the bandwidth is .
"[41:02] me018 | that looked like it was doing something like that , but I didn't quite understand it ."
"[41:05] me013 | Yeah , so the idea is that the very lowest frequencies and and typically the veriest highest frequencies are kind of junk ."
[41:11] me018 | Uh - huh .
[41:17] me013 | by the second to highest and second to lowest .
[41:20] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[41:20] me013 | It 's just a simple thing we put in .
[41:23] me013 | And and so if you h
[41:27] me013 | I think that 's a fixed thing . But
"[41:31] me013 | If you had ten filters ,"
[41:33] me013 | then you would be throwing away a lot at the two ends .
[41:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[41:37] me013 | if you had
"[41:38] me013 | fifty filters , you 'd be throwing away hardly anything ."
[41:41] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:42] me013 | Um , I don't remember there being an independent way of saying "" we 're just gonna"
"[41:46] me013 | make them from here to here "" ."
[41:47] me018 | Use this analysis bandwidth or something .
"[41:48] me013 | But I I I don't know , it 's actually been awhile since I 've looked at it ."
"[41:50] me018 | Yeah , I went through the Feacalc code and then"
[41:53] me018 | looked at
[41:54] me018 | you know just calling the RASTA libs and thing like that . And I didn't I couldn't see any wh place where that kind of thing was done .
[41:59] me018 | But
[42:00] me018 | um
"[42:02] me013 | Yeah , see I don't know Feacalc at all ."
[42:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:05] me013 | But it calls RASTA with some options , and"
[42:07] me018 | Right .
[42:07] me013 | um
"[42:10] me013 | I don't know . I guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better , but I think that"
[42:18] me013 | in general it 's not
[42:21] me018 | Yeah .
[42:23] me013 | You can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so and it 's just
[42:26] me013 | not going to affect
[42:27] me013 | phonetic classification at all .
[42:37] me018 | certain settings of the parameters when you compute PLP which would basically cause it to output
[42:42] me018 | mel cepstrum .
"[42:45] me018 | So that , in effect , what I could do is use our code but produce mel cepstrum"
"[42:52] me013 | Well , it 's not precisely ."
"[42:53] me013 | Yeah . I mean , um ,"
[42:54] me018 | Hmm .
[42:56] me013 | um
[42:58] me013 | what you can do
[43:01] me013 | is um
[43:05] me013 | you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh
"[43:09] me013 | a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one ,"
[43:13] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[43:14] me013 | which is what the typical mel mel cepstral uh filter bank does .
[43:17] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:18] me013 | And some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that , so you certainly could do that"
[43:23] me013 | easily .
"[43:26] me018 | There 's a cubic root that happens , right ?"
"[43:30] me013 | Yeah , but , you know , as opposed to the log in the other case . I mean"
[43:33] me013 | the fundamental d d difference that we 've seen any
"[43:46] me013 | uh , from cepstral truncation ."
[43:49] me013 | So um it 's a little more noise robust .
[43:51] me018 | Hmm .
"[43:53] me013 | Um , and that 's that 's why when"
[43:57] me013 | like uh um
"[43:58] me013 | Broadcast News and so on , that 's why c Cambridge switched to PLP I think ."
[44:02] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[44:03] me013 | So um
[44:05] me013 | That 's a difference that I don't
"[44:08] me013 | think we put any way to get around , since it was an advantage ."
[44:11] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[44:12] me013 | um
[44:14] me013 | eh we did hear this comment
"[44:16] me013 | from people at some point ,"
[44:17] me013 | that
[44:19] me013 | um
[44:20] me013 | it
[44:20] me013 | uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal . So that is an option
[44:26] me013 | in RASTA .
[44:27] me018 | Hmm .
[44:28] me013 | Uh and you can certainly
[44:29] me013 | play with that .
[44:30] me013 | But I think you 're probably doing the right thing to look for bugs first .
[44:33] me018 | Yeah just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by
[44:33] me013 | I don't know .
[44:37] me018 | you know s
[44:38] me018 | some of the training data being messed up .
[44:40] me013 | Could be .
[44:45] me018 | One of the things that I did notice was that the um
[44:49] me018 | log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer
[44:53] me018 | from the PLP data
[44:54] me018 | were much
"[44:55] me018 | lower ,"
"[44:56] me018 | much smaller ,"
"[44:57] me018 | than for the mel cepstral stuff ,"
[44:59] me018 | and that the
[45:01] me018 | average amount of pruning that was happening
[45:04] me018 | was therefore a little bit higher
[45:05] me018 | for the PLP features .
[45:07] me013 | Oh - huh !
"[45:08] me018 | So , since he used the same exact pruning thresholds for both ,"
[45:11] me018 | I was wondering if it could be that we 're getting more pruning .
[45:15] me013 | Oh !
[45:17] me013 | He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli
[45:19] me018 | Yeah .
[45:21] me018 | Right .
[45:22] me018 | Right .
[45:23] me013 | That 's a pretty good point right there . Yeah .
[45:25] me013 | I would think that you might wanna do something like uh
"[45:29] me013 | you know , look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors ."
[45:33] me018 | Right .
"[45:33] me018 | Well , what I was gonna do is I was gonna take"
"[45:35] me018 | um a couple of the utterances that he had run through ,"
[45:39] me018 | then
[45:40] me018 | run them through again but modify the pruning threshold and see if it
"[45:44] me018 | you know ,"
[45:44] me013 | Yeah .
[45:44] me018 | affects the score .
[45:46] me013 | Yeah .
[45:47] me018 | So .
"[45:48] me013 | if if that looks promising you could , you know , r uh run"
[45:52] me013 | the overall test set
"[45:53] me013 | with a with a few different uh pruning thresholds for both ,"
[45:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:56] me018 | Right .
[46:02] me013 | gets
[46:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:07] me018 | you turn back pruning really far , so"
[46:10] me018 | I I didn't think it would be that big a deal because I was figuring well you have it turned back so far that
[46:15] me013 | But you may be in the wrong range for the P L P features for some reason .
[46:16] me018 | Yeah .
[46:16] me018 | Yeah .
[46:17] me018 | Yeah .
[46:18] me018 | And the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the PLP features is longer
"[46:22] me018 | which sort of implies that the networks are bushier ,"
"[46:25] me018 | you know , there 's more things it 's considering"
[46:26] me018 | which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .
[46:29] me018 | So
"[46:30] me018 | uh , you know , it could be that we 're just pruning"
[46:33] me018 | too much .
[46:35] me018 | So .
[46:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:37] me013 | Yeah , maybe just be different kind of distributions and and yeah so that 's another"
[46:39] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[46:41] me013 | possible thing .
[46:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[46:43] me013 | They they should really shouldn't There 's no particular reason why they would be
[46:47] me013 | exactly behave exactly the same .
[46:48] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[46:49] me018 | Right .
[46:50] me018 | Right .
[46:51] me013 | So .
[46:51] me018 | So .
[46:52] me018 | There 's lots of little differences . So .
[46:53] me013 | Yeah .
[46:55] me013 | Yeah .
[46:56] me018 | Trying to track it down .
[46:57] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:58] me013 | I guess this was a little bit off topic , I guess , because I was I was thinking in terms of th this as being a a a a core"
[47:05] me013 | item that once we once we had it going we would use for a number of the front - end things also .
[47:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[47:10] me013 | So .
[47:13] me013 | um
"[47:17] me026 | as far as my stuff goes ,"
"[47:18] me026 | yeah , well I"
[47:18] me013 | Yeah .
"[47:20] me026 | tried this mean subtraction method . Um . Due to Avendano ,"
[47:23] me026 | I 'm taking s um
"[47:25] me026 | six seconds of speech , um"
[47:27] me026 | I 'm using two second
"[47:29] me026 | FFT analysis frames ,"
[47:31] me026 | stepped by a half second
"[47:35] me026 | I take that frame and four f the four I take Sorry , I take the current frame and the four past frames and the"
[47:41] me026 | four future frames and that adds up to six seconds of speech .
[47:44] me026 | And I calculate um
"[47:46] me026 | the spectral mean ,"
[47:48] me026 | of the log magnitude spectrum over that N .
[47:52] me026 | I use that to normalize the s the current center frame
[47:56] me026 | by mean subtraction .
[47:59] me026 | I do it again .
"[48:01] me026 | Well , actually I calculate all the means first and then I do the subtraction ."
[48:04] me026 | And um
"[48:05] me026 | the I tried that with HDK , the Aurora setup of HDK training on clean TI - digits ,"
[48:11] me026 | and um
[48:12] me026 | it it helped um in a phony reverberation case
[48:16] me026 | um
[48:17] me026 | where I just used the simulated impulse response
[48:19] me026 | um
[48:20] me026 | the error rate went from something like eighty
[48:23] me026 | it was from something like eighteen percent
[48:25] me026 | to um four percent .
"[48:31] me026 | on channel F , it went from um"
[48:34] me026 | forty - one percent error to eight percent error .
"[48:39] me018 | On on the real data , not with artificial reverb ?"
[48:42] me026 | Right .
[48:42] me018 | Uh - huh .
[48:44] me026 | And that that was um
"[48:46] me026 | trained on clean speech only , which I 'm guessing is the reason why the baseline was so bad ."
[48:51] me026 | Uh - huh .
[48:53] me013 | That 's ac
[48:54] me013 | actually a little side point is I think that 's the first results that we have
[48:58] me013 | uh
[48:59] me013 | uh
[49:00] me013 | uh of any sort
[49:03] me013 | on on the far field data
[49:05] me013 | uh for recorded in in meetings .
[49:07] me026 | Oh um actually um
[49:09] me026 | Adam ran the SRI recognizer .
[49:09] me013 | Did he ?
"[49:12] me013 | On the near field , on the ne"
[49:13] me026 | On the far field also . He did one PZM channel and one PDA channel .
[49:14] me013 | Oh did he ?
[49:16] me013 | Oh ! I didn't recall that .
[49:18] me013 | What kind of numbers was he getting with that ?
"[49:21] me026 | I 'm not sure , I think it was about five percent error for the PZM channel ."
[49:27] me013 | Five .
[49:28] me026 | f I think . Yeah .
[49:32] me026 | Um .
[49:33] me026 | I I 'm g I 'm guessing it was the the training data .
"[49:36] me026 | Uh , clean TI - digits is , like ,"
[49:38] me026 | pretty pristine
"[49:39] me026 | training data , and if they trained"
[49:41] me026 | the SRI system on this
"[49:51] me013 | What am I saying here ? Yeah , so that was the SRI system ."
[49:56] me013 | So it 's still this kind of ratio . It was it was getting one percent or something on the near field . Wasn't it ?
"[50:02] me018 | Mm - hmm , or"
[50:03] me013 | Yeah . Yeah . I think it was getting around one percent for the near for the n
[50:03] me018 | it wa a it was around one . Yeah .
[50:06] me013 | for the close mike .
[50:07] me026 | Huh ?
[50:08] me026 | OK .
"[50:11] me013 | yeah , it 's a lot more training data ."
[50:13] me013 | So
[50:23] me013 | and then uh use th use it for the SRI system .
[50:31] me026 | b You me you mean um ta
"[50:32] me013 | So you 're so you have a system which for one reason or another is relatively poor ,"
[50:36] me026 | Yeah .
[50:36] me013 | and and uh you have something like forty - one percent error
[50:40] me013 | uh and then you transform it to eight by doing doing this this work .
"[50:45] me013 | So here 's this other system , which is a lot better ,"
"[50:52] me013 | with the the distant mike , and one percent with the close mike ."
[50:55] me026 | OK .
[50:56] me013 | So the question is
[50:57] me013 | how close to that one can you get
[50:59] me013 | if you transform the data using that system .
"[51:02] me026 | r Right , so so I guess this SRI system is trained on a lot of s Broadcast News or Switchboard data ."
[51:08] me013 | Yeah .
[51:08] me026 | Is that right ? Do you know which one it is ?
[51:09] me018 | It 's trained on a lot of different things . Um .
[51:12] me018 | It 's trained on
"[51:13] me018 | uh a lot of Switchboard , Call Home ,"
[51:15] me026 | Uh - huh .
[51:15] me018 | um
"[51:17] me018 | a bunch of different sources , some digits , there 's some digits training in there ."
[51:19] me026 | OK .
[51:20] me026 | O one thing I 'm wondering about is what this mean subtraction method
[51:20] me006 | Hmm .
[51:24] me026 | um will do if it 's faced with additive noise .
[51:27] me026 | Cuz I I it 's cuz I don't know what log magnitude spectral subtraction is gonna do
[51:32] me026 | to additive noise .
"[51:33] me013 | Yeah , well , it 's it 's not exactly the right thing but"
[51:35] me026 | Uh - huh .
[51:37] me013 | but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here .
"[51:40] me026 | That 's that 's Yeah , that 's true ."
[51:42] me013 | Yeah .
[51:43] me026 | That 's a good point .
[51:49] me026 | it 's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the SRI system and
"[51:53] me013 | Yeah , I mean , as helpful I mean ,"
[51:55] me013 | so that 's the question .
"[51:56] me013 | Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that that isn't isn't sort of industry industry standard great ,"
[52:02] me026 | Uh - huh .
[52:08] me013 | on a on a good system .
[52:09] me013 | So
"[52:12] me013 | you know , this other one 's it was a pretty good system . I think ,"
"[52:14] me013 | you know , one one percent"
[52:15] me013 | word error rate on digits is uh digit strings is not
[52:21] me013 | but given that this is real
[52:23] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[52:26] me013 | Well .
[52:26] me018 | And it wasn't trained on this task either .
"[52:30] me013 | you know , sort of in a reasonable range . People would say "" yeah , I could I can imagine getting that "" ."
[52:31] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[52:34] me013 | And uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor .
[52:38] me026 | Mm - hmm .
[52:41] me013 | a sixteen digit uh credit card number you 'll
[52:44] me013 | basically get it wrong almost all the time .
"[52:45] me013 | So . So . Uh ,"
[52:46] me026 | Hmm .
[52:48] me013 | um a significant reduction in the error for that would be great .
"[52:51] me026 | Huh , OK ."
"[52:51] me013 | And and then , uh Yeah . So ."
[52:54] me013 | Yeah .
[52:55] me013 | Cool .
[52:56] me026 | Sounds good .
[52:57] me013 | Yeah .
"[52:58] me013 | Alright , um ,"
[52:59] me013 | I actually have to run .
"[53:01] me013 | So I don't think I can do the digits , but"
"[53:03] me013 | um ,"
[53:04] me013 | I guess I 'll leave my microphone on ?
"[53:07] me018 | Uh , yeah ."
"[53:23] me013 | Actually , I could just go first , come to think of it ."
[53:26] me018 | Yeah . That 'll work .
[53:29] me013 | That 's alright . I just have to run for another appointment .
"[53:31] me013 | OK , did I t Yeah . I left it on ."
[53:33] me013 | OK .

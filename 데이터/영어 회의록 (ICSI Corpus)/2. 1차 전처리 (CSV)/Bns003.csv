[00:06] me011 | Testing .
[00:17] me011 | O K .
[00:17] me011 | Are we on ?
[00:19] me011 | Yep .
"[00:25] me011 | OK , thanks again ."
"[00:26] mn082 | OK , we can start ?"
[00:27] me011 | Yep .
"[00:27] mn082 | OK . Thank you , Adam . I will call you then when we are ready . I believe , maybe one hour , in that sense ."
[00:28] me011 | Just give me a call .
"[00:32] mn082 | OK , welcome to our next meeting ."
[00:35] mn082 | Um I have couple of points we should discussed .
"[00:38] mn082 | One is related to the proposal ,"
"[00:40] mn082 | Michael , please can you"
[00:41] mn035 | Yep .
[00:42] mn082 | close the door ?
[00:42] mn082 | Thank you .
"[00:44] mn082 | And , um"
"[00:46] mn082 | furthermore , as most of you know I will leave in"
"[00:49] mn082 | tenth of December , I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime ,"
"[00:53] mn082 | because I get ,"
"[00:54] mn082 | I would like to say , different signals from Siemens ,"
"[00:57] mn082 | I believe , in the meantime it 's a higher probability that I will return ,"
"[01:01] mn082 | but based on the pro uh , procedure to get a J - one visa and the IP six six"
"[01:09] mn082 | I would like to say , earliest stage will be end of January ,"
"[01:16] mn082 | Then furthermore I would like to know the status of everybody . I know for sure , OK ,"
"[01:21] mn082 | um Miguel , you will have your plans"
"[01:25] mn082 | for this , uh , ongoing process , uh ,"
[01:27] mn082 | concerning your work .
"[01:29] mn082 | OK , from you it 's"
"[01:30] mn082 | definitely clear , in principle ."
"[01:32] mn082 | OK , for Michael ,"
[01:33] mn082 | what are your current plans and
"[01:35] mn082 | Dietmar , maybe you then , also ."
"[01:41] mn082 | USAIA and also this , uh , your current work ,"
"[01:45] mn082 | and from my point , it seems to be clear that I will go back"
"[01:49] mn082 | definitely at tenth of December ,"
"[01:51] mn082 | and , as I mentioned before ,"
"[01:54] mn082 | more than fifty percent , I would like to say , that I will be come back"
[01:58] mn082 | to
[01:59] mn082 | get the freedom
[02:01] mn082 | to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form
"[02:05] mn082 | and get , in principle , paid"
[02:07] mn082 | by another project within Siemens .
"[02:11] mn082 | So the point is how long I will stay . I believe , a couple of months definitely"
"[02:26] mn082 | so that is my current opinion , concerning how Siemens deal with with my , uh , ongoing effort ."
"[02:32] mn082 | And , furthermore , I would like to First of all , thanks to"
[02:37] mn082 | uh Dietmar because he started to use a
[02:39] mn082 | testbed .
[02:40] mn030 | Oh .
[02:41] mn082 | Eh
"[02:42] mn082 | in principle , in his spare time ."
[02:43] mn082 | Yeah !
[02:44] mn030 | Yeah .
"[02:45] mn082 | Uh I will So so the first , uh"
"[02:48] mn082 | uh ,"
"[02:48] mn082 | box , this morning ."
"[02:50] mn082 | I will set up , definitely , in my spare time , in the evenings and the weekends the second box ,"
[02:54] mn082 | and I 'm looking for two other volunteers
[02:57] mn082 | who are setting the third and the fourth box .
[02:59] mn021 | But wh wh wh what are the box ?
[03:01] mn082 | A box is a s P C .
[03:02] mn030 | P Cs . P Cs .
[03:03] mn021 | But what w
"[03:04] mn082 | Equipped with with we should equipped it with with Linux or maybe too with Free BSD , I doubt I don't know"
[03:08] mn030 | Well the first
"[03:10] mn030 | stop , the first thing the most , eh , complicated is to fit them with the"
"[03:16] mn030 | removable um , hard disk ."
[03:18] mn082 | And now we have an expert .
[03:19] mn030 | Yeah .
[03:25] mn030 | the
"[03:26] mn030 | Oh ,"
[03:26] mn030 | what 's the right word ?
[03:28] mn030 | I had to
[03:29] mn030 | put everything out
"[03:32] mn082 | Yeah , to remov"
[03:34] mn021 | OK .
"[03:38] mn030 | but i but it 's not not , um very , uh difficult or something like that ."
"[03:42] mn082 | Uh - huh ,"
[03:44] mn082 | Why you are laughing ?
"[03:47] mn082 | I don't know , I cou I s I didn't see him ,"
"[03:52] mn082 | I know in the meantime it 's running , and I will definitely set up the next one ."
[03:52] mn030 | Uh !
[03:54] mn030 | So Wilbert will set up the second computer .
"[03:56] mn082 | Yeah , though my idea maybe you eh can equip it with a"
"[03:59] mn082 | I don't know what your time constrain whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with Free BSD , for instance . Yeah ."
"[04:03] mn021 | I can build , eh , any computer uh you n installing whatever ."
"[04:06] mn082 | OK , uh - huh ."
"[04:07] mn021 | It 's needed , I mean , I"
[04:09] mn021 | will enjoy doing it . So .
[04:09] mn082 | Do you find the time ?
[04:11] mn021 | That 's OK for me .
[04:12] mn081 | Mmm .
[04:14] mn081 | No promises .
[04:17] mn081 | No .
"[04:17] mn082 | and even maybe to to , uh put your I G M P stuff on it ."
[04:21] mn082 | Eh
[04:23] mn081 | No promises .
[04:24] mn082 | No promises .
[04:24] mn081 | No .
"[04:28] mn030 | So it 's about one hour to put this , uh hard disk in and"
"[04:32] mn030 | a further hour to , uh Well ,"
[04:34] mn030 | two or three hours
[04:36] mn030 | to install the operating systems .
"[04:37] mn082 | Nee , because then the network is still running then ."
"[04:39] mn082 | Could we wait until the network is running ? Because currently it 's not possible ,"
[04:41] mn030 | Yeah .
[04:42] mn030 | At the moment .
"[04:43] mn082 | uh , based on certain fire wall constraints . I believe David is , uh , currently working on that ."
[04:49] mn082 | to
"[04:50] mn082 | set up the fire wall , and he 's not an expert for that"
[04:53] mn082 | and when I get the signal I will ask one more time .
"[04:56] mn082 | Nah , but nevertheless thanks to Dietmar that he @ @ ."
[04:58] mn081 | Did the networks have internet connectivity ?
"[05:00] mn082 | Yes , we have , eh , for for secure socket ,"
"[05:03] mn082 | and , uh for web access ,"
[05:06] mn082 | the fire wall is open . That 's all .
"[05:08] mn082 | And But currently it 's not working , right ?"
[05:14] mn030 | Linux the first time
[05:16] mn030 | I
"[05:17] mn030 | got access to the local network here ,"
"[05:20] mn030 | um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI ."
"[05:24] mn030 | And , till Monday there 's no access at all to any machines ,"
[05:29] mn030 | also not to inside machines .
"[05:31] mn082 | But then ,"
[05:37] mn081 | But normally you should have access to th
"[05:39] mn081 | all the internet , r"
[05:40] mn081 | to outside .
[05:41] mn082 | Yes .
"[05:41] mn082 | Yeah ,"
[05:42] mn082 | You have
[05:42] mn081 | Full .
"[05:42] mn082 | internet outside access ,"
"[05:44] mn082 | but no telnet and not R - login or whatever kind of things , you know ."
[05:45] mn081 | A restricted in .
[05:50] mn081 | Not a no FTP .
"[05:51] mn082 | Yeah , FTP yes ."
[05:53] mn081 | H
[05:53] mn082 | But no telnet .
[05:54] mn081 | Hmm .
"[05:57] mn082 | The the the point is that we will use it , as it is uh described several times , that we will use it as a local network , in principle ,"
[06:03] mn082 | but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of
"[06:06] mn082 | uh , media transportation f to put some stuff you need"
"[06:09] mn082 | from your PC or your LS to this , uh uh ,"
"[06:13] mn082 | uh , to this testbed , you know ."
[06:14] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[06:15] mn082 | So
"[06:15] mn082 | you download it , if that s must be possible from the network , but normally"
[06:22] mn082 | uh
"[06:22] mn082 | for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than ,"
"[06:27] mn082 | uh , one box"
"[06:28] mn082 | which you have on your desktop ,"
"[06:30] mn082 | cuz that is the primary , uh uh reason for this testbed ."
"[06:35] mn082 | So , definitely you have to have"
[06:37] mn082 | web access
[06:38] mn082 | to download the necessary files .
[06:39] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[06:44] mn082 | So and then furthermore , one more thanks to Claudia ."
[06:48] mn082 | He did a lot of work and I could only
[06:49] fn083 | Right .
"[06:51] fn083 | Ah , the messages . Oh ."
[06:51] mn082 | pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages .
"[06:56] mn082 | And now we are , in principle , in the state we have to do it with a project"
[07:01] mn082 | area . But they 're also some contributions from you guys requested .
[07:05] mn082 | Um
"[07:06] mn082 | and the alumni page , in principle , we have to ,"
"[07:09] mn082 | you know ,"
"[07:10] mn082 | but it 's primarily my job , I believe ,"
"[07:12] mn082 | uh , to set up so that it is , uh adjusted really to the people"
[07:16] mn082 | who are worth to be
"[07:17] mn082 | alumnis alumnis , yeah ."
"[07:20] fn083 | "" Alumni "" ."
"[07:20] mn082 | "" Alumni "" ."
[07:21] mn082 | I 'm not sure how to pronounce this word .
[07:22] mn035 | Aber das wird jetzt geaendert .
[07:24] mn082 | Huh ?
[07:24] mn035 | Das wird geaendert .
"[07:28] mn082 | But , um"
[07:30] mn082 | I think everybody should
"[07:33] mn082 | take a look to the web pages ,"
"[07:35] mn082 | and inform Claudia if something , uh , has to be"
[07:39] mn082 | improved or if there 's some comments or
[07:40] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[07:43] mn082 | uh
[07:44] mn082 | He 's laughing all the time . Why ?
"[07:47] mn082 | Uh because it is you know , that 's very important"
[07:51] mn082 | maybe now not for us
[07:53] mn082 | but maybe for our successors and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever .
"[07:59] mn082 | So , my point of view I will"
[08:01] mn082 | doc I will
[08:01] mn082 | documented everything
[08:03] mn082 | when I will leave here in the sense that
[08:06] mn082 | potential successor as a group leader
[08:09] mn082 | can hook in with these things
[08:11] mn082 | and that
"[08:12] mn082 | these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary . We tried to do it ,"
[08:18] mn082 | so that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen .
"[08:21] mn082 | So that means somebody 's leaving the group ,"
"[08:24] mn082 | uh , somebody is joining the group , a new project is started ,"
"[08:27] mn082 | but , uh , the effort should be minimized as possible ."
"[08:31] mn082 | And , so please"
[08:33] mn082 | take a look to the web pages
[08:35] mn082 | and
[08:36] mn082 | I have announced in the project area
[08:40] mn082 | the major headlines .
"[08:43] mn082 | And especially , Wilbert , maybe you can write something"
[08:47] mn082 | about
[08:48] mn082 | yours ?
"[08:49] mn082 | I call it , I believe , "" Multicast "" and then "" Development deployment "" ,"
"[08:53] mn082 | eh , for for source specific multicas maybe a few lines , maybe a picture ."
"[08:58] mn082 | And something like that should be added to USAIA ? OK , that 's my stuff ."
[09:02] mn082 | And
[09:04] mn082 | um
[09:06] mn082 | then
[09:07] mn082 | the
[09:08] mn082 | next point is then this
[09:10] mn082 | active routing stuff ?
[09:12] mn082 | Um
"[09:13] mn082 | I would like to discuss it before , but"
[09:15] mn082 | you were busy .
"[09:16] mn021 | Yeah , OK ."
"[09:19] mn082 | um , I believe , it must be adjusted"
[09:22] mn082 | to the current activities
[09:24] mn082 | a little bit more .
[09:25] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:26] mn082 | And , um"
[09:29] mn082 | It is not worth to discuss it now because nobody raised it before .
"[09:32] mn021 | Yeah , I think so ."
"[09:33] mn082 | And , uh , so l let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards ."
[09:37] mn082 | I would what I would like to have is
[09:39] mn082 | that
"[09:40] mn082 | um ,"
[09:41] mn082 | your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here .
[09:46] mn082 | And that means really to the project proposal itself
"[09:50] mn082 | and also maybe to the USAIA architecture , in that sense ,"
"[09:54] mn082 | that at certain stages ,"
"[09:55] mn082 | cuz it 's a general architecture , certain stages maybe to future"
[09:59] mn082 | mobile
"[10:00] mn082 | core networks ,"
[10:01] mn082 | that it is related
[10:03] mn082 | to these kind of things .
"[10:05] mn082 | Um , having uh , I what I have in mind is"
[10:08] mn082 | that things should not be started from the end system .
"[10:12] mn082 | That 's my principle concern ,"
"[10:13] mn082 | because that will never be happen , from my point of view ."
"[10:18] mn082 | It should be started as the edge device ,"
"[10:21] mn082 | so that it cu certain kind of mechanism , whatever ,"
[10:24] mn082 | is enabled between the
"[10:26] mn082 | ingress edge device and the outgress a edge device ,"
[10:29] mn082 | because it will be at the certain stage
[10:31] mn082 | IP based in the future generation telecommunication networks
[10:32] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[10:34] mn021 | That 's OK .
[10:34] mn082 | before its goal .
"[10:35] mn082 | Fuel it to the over the internet , and b between these both boxes ,"
[10:40] mn082 | I can assume
[10:42] mn082 | uh because the mobility happens there
[10:44] mn082 | as a normal natural thing
"[10:47] mn082 | and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated , from my point of view ."
"[10:52] mn082 | And to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism ,"
[10:55] mn082 | that the packets can be used
[10:57] mn082 | to set up the routes because they have all the information .
[11:00] mn082 | They know where they have to go because IP addresses are still there
[11:03] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[11:04] mn082 | and within the packet . I mean , how can this use ,"
"[11:06] mn082 | uh , within this area , and how this area is then aligned"
[11:10] mn082 | to the more traditional routing within the
[11:14] mn082 | internet backbone itself .
[11:15] mn082 | That 's my question .
[11:20] mn082 | I 'm not a e xpert at all for this .
"[11:22] mn082 | But I I I believe , there 's a lot of potential for that ."
[11:25] mn082 | And we should discuss it maybe
[11:27] mn021 | OK .
[11:27] mn082 | bilateral afterwards .
[11:28] mn021 | OK .
[11:29] mn082 | Yeah ?
"[11:30] mn082 | So , one more time , everybody"
[11:33] mn082 | should take a look to the web pages
"[11:36] mn082 | and from Claudia , at the general remarks"
[11:38] mn082 | and should write
"[11:40] mn082 | based on the , uh ,"
[11:42] mn082 | headlines in the project proposal
[11:44] mn082 | the
[11:46] mn082 | um
"[11:47] mn082 | things what still happened ,"
[11:49] mn082 | the things what they have still in mind
[11:52] mn082 | uh so that we can update these last @ @ you know @ @ present the last major
[11:57] mn082 | part of the web pages .
[11:59] mn030 | The pages are already on the web ?
[11:59] mn021 | OK .
"[12:01] fn083 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:01] mn082 | Yes ,"
[12:01] mn030 | Yeah .
[12:02] fn083 | It is .
"[12:02] mn082 | you can now access it normally with maybe WWW ICSI Berkeley EDU ,"
[12:04] fn083 | So there are some gaps .
[12:04] mn030 | OK .
[12:06] mn030 | Hmm .
[12:07] mn082 | and
[12:08] mn082 | so .
[12:08] mn030 | OK .
"[12:09] fn083 | Yeah , so there are some gaps left and ,"
"[12:11] fn083 | I don't know ,"
[12:11] fn083 | you Maybe you can also read through the all the text which is on the web pages cuz I 'd like to change the text a bit
[12:17] fn083 | cuz
"[12:18] fn083 | sometimes it 's too long , sometimes it 's too short ,"
"[12:21] fn083 | maybe the English is not that good ,"
[12:22] fn083 | so
"[12:23] fn083 | um ,"
[12:25] fn083 | So I tried to do this today
[12:26] fn083 | and
"[12:27] fn083 | if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice cuz I 'm quite sure that I can't find every ,"
"[12:31] fn083 | like , orthographic"
[12:33] fn083 | mistake in it or something .
"[12:33] mn021 | Uh , there there there are couple of comments I I have about the web pages ."
[12:37] fn083 | Good .
"[12:37] mn021 | One is is the , uh , I think it 's Joe 's , uh , graphic , I think it should be better ."
"[12:42] fn083 | Yeah , yeah , yeah , the graphics are too bad ."
[12:42] mn082 | Yeah .
[12:43] mn021 | Maybe you are working at it .
[12:43] fn083 | I know .
[12:43] mn082 | You are definitely right .
"[12:45] mn082 | It was in a good shape , but"
"[12:46] mn021 | OK ,"
"[12:47] mn082 | it , uh , then we disturbed ."
[12:51] fn083 | I can't change
[12:52] fn083 | something with a logo .
"[12:55] mn021 | Maybe we can we can ,"
"[12:57] mn021 | uh ,"
[12:58] mn021 | translate the white color into transparent color
[13:01] mn021 | so it will get more natural .
"[13:02] fn083 | Yeah , OK ."
"[13:03] fn083 | Good ,"
[13:04] fn083 | yeah I ju
[13:04] mn021 | It 's just a suggestion .
[13:05] fn083 | an
[13:05] fn083 | another thing is I 'd want to
[13:07] fn083 | get a link on the logo so that you can
[13:11] mn021 | To the home page .
[13:12] mn021 | OK .
[13:13] mn021 | That 's that 's OK .
[13:13] fn083 | back .
[13:13] fn083 | So .
[13:14] fn083 | That 's these are th
[13:15] fn083 | some things I have to do .
"[13:17] fn083 | Yeah , and if you have something which I should"
"[13:18] fn083 | put on the web page for you , so"
"[13:20] fn083 | yeah , some pictures will be nice , a few sentences will be nice , and"
"[13:24] fn083 | yeah , it"
[13:24] fn083 | depends on how much time you have .
[13:26] fn083 | And then
"[13:29] fn083 | So , some information for"
[13:30] fn083 | people who are
"[13:32] fn083 | new comers or ,"
"[13:33] fn083 | I don't know a good word for it , should we use uh"
"[13:37] fn083 | So , with somebody who is new , arriving here ,"
[13:39] fn083 | or
"[13:41] fn083 | to , uh , send an application ?"
[13:44] mn081 | Newbies .
[13:44] fn083 | S
[13:45] fn083 | Huh ?
[13:46] mn081 | Newbies .
[13:47] fn083 | Newbies ?
"[13:49] fn083 | Yeah , OK ."
"[13:51] fn083 | So , there I have to add some information , I don't know , I t"
[13:54] fn083 | I tried to set up everything by today
"[13:57] fn083 | for this page cuz I 've started with this ,"
"[13:59] fn083 | um , if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you"
[14:03] fn083 | then just let m
[14:04] fn083 | cuz I have some
[14:05] fn083 | points like
[14:08] fn083 | I don't know
"[14:09] fn083 | f yeah , like Pacific Bell , like uh , long - distance carriers , then like uh , cars and car insurances ,"
"[14:18] fn083 | So , health insurance is k something I can only say for German"
[14:20] fn083 | people .
[14:20] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
[14:21] fn083 | So maybe
[14:22] fn083 | I don't know if this is different in Spain .
[14:23] fn083 | That would be
"[14:24] fn083 | fine too ,"
"[14:25] fn083 | to have some information , or in D"
[14:25] mn021 | OK .
[14:26] fn083 | nnn
[14:27] mn021 | I
[14:27] fn083 | Holland . I don't know .
[14:28] mn021 | I will take a look and I will tell you something .
"[14:30] fn083 | Yeah , so how maybe how you did it or"
[14:30] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[14:33] fn083 | whatsoever .
"[14:33] mn082 | OK , I will send you some because I have something in mind ."
[14:34] fn083 | So
"[14:35] fn083 | yeah ,"
[14:36] fn083 | then what else
[14:37] fn083 | did I have ?
[14:37] fn083 | Then
"[14:39] fn083 | another point 's like , uh , what about the bank ,"
"[14:41] fn083 | uh , so , transferring your money from Europe t"
"[14:44] fn083 | over here , what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something ."
"[14:51] fn083 | yeah , and then"
[14:53] fn083 | there 's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in
[14:57] fn083 | the
[14:57] fn083 | neighborhood .
"[14:57] mn081 | This a lot of this stuff is not networking group NSA ,"
"[15:01] mn081 | uh , restricted ."
"[15:01] fn083 | No , I know ."
"[15:02] mn082 | Yeah , but nobody do that , you know ."
[15:03] fn083 | I know .
[15:06] fn083 | on the
[15:07] fn083 | ICSI page as far as I know .
"[15:09] mn082 | So ,"
[15:10] mn082 | that 's the point . We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago .
"[15:14] mn082 | Uh , the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway ."
[15:18] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[15:18] mn081 | M
[15:18] mn082 | But
[15:20] mn082 | Right .
[15:21] mn082 | @ @
"[15:21] mn081 | mmm , I think be , uh , ICSI part , and not network restricted ."
"[15:24] mn021 | Well , th they have uh , a a white booklet ,"
"[15:27] mn082 | Yeah , that is from nineteen ninety - one or nineteen ninety - two , you know ."
[15:30] fn083 | This is not on the web .
"[15:31] mn021 | No , no , no ."
[15:33] mn021 | I I just I
[15:33] mn082 | people
"[15:37] mn021 | In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example"
[15:41] mn021 | the phone on this booklet it was not working .
[15:43] mn082 | Hmm .
[15:44] mn021 | But the thing is that maybe
[15:48] fn083 | Yeah .
"[15:50] fn083 | I don't know , maybe I talk with Jane about this . If we can"
"[15:53] fn083 | use this information ,"
"[15:54] fn083 | I don't know ,"
[15:55] fn083 | somewhere
[15:56] fn083 | on the ICSI home page too .
"[15:56] mn081 | M move it on the normal ICSI ,"
[15:58] fn083 | Yeah .
[15:59] mn081 | ICSI .
[15:59] fn083 | Maybe .
[16:00] mn082 | We can do that .
[16:03] mn081 | a gro uh
"[16:05] mn082 | Yeah , but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that ."
"[16:09] mn081 | Yeah , but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group"
"[16:14] mn082 | Yes ,"
"[16:15] mn082 | Uh , yes , I see there your point ."
[16:16] mn081 | OK .
"[16:16] mn082 | That 's right . But if it is under the networking points , the group leader is responsible to"
"[16:20] mn082 | get up to date information . I believe , we are the group ,"
"[16:23] mn082 | where the people are ,"
"[16:25] mn082 | uh , changing"
[16:26] mn082 | much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups .
[16:28] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:31] mn082 | And , so , the most problem"
"[16:34] mn082 | as as of ,"
"[16:35] mn082 | uh , it 's likely that uh , the people here in this group needs this information"
"[16:40] mn082 | um , much more f uh , often as as other groups ."
[16:42] mn081 | b
[16:44] mn081 | But that could still be
[16:45] mn081 | applicable if you put it under the ICSI site if you take the responsibility for that .
"[16:51] mn082 | Yes , I see th"
"[16:52] fn083 | Yeah , I talk to Jane about this ."
"[16:52] mn081 | Uh ,"
"[16:53] mn082 | Yeah , but we we can do that ."
[16:53] mn081 | So I think th I think both arguments are not an ar
[16:55] mn081 | are arguments against having this under the normal ICSI page .
"[17:00] mn081 | Or only the networking , uh , page ."
"[17:04] mn035 | But the problem is , are you allowed to change anything on the"
[17:04] mn081 | Yeah .
[17:08] mn035 | general ICSI server ?
"[17:09] fn083 | No , this is why I have to talk to Jane ."
[17:10] mn035 | Yeah .
[17:11] mn035 | So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page .
"[17:12] mn082 | We have the we have the directory structure ,"
[17:15] mn082 | of the real UNIX tree .
[17:18] mn082 | in compliance and in accordance
[17:21] mn082 | with the structure of the web pages .
"[17:24] mn082 | And , um , that means , uh ,"
[17:28] mn082 | the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages .
[17:32] mn082 | He has access to the N S A pages .
"[17:34] mn082 | And , um ,"
[17:36] mn082 | but I think that 's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information
[17:40] mn082 | page must be
"[17:42] mn082 | on the general , on the highest level ."
"[17:45] mn082 | OK , I have no problem with that ."
"[17:47] mn030 | But , uh"
"[17:48] mn030 | your argument is , uh , I think it"
[17:49] mn035 | Yeah .
[17:51] mn030 | we have to
[17:52] mn030 | have the right to change it .
[17:54] mn030 | So if there 's anything changing in
"[17:57] mn030 | something like that ,"
[17:59] mn030 | that we have access
[18:00] mn030 | to this
[18:02] mn081 | Yeah .
[18:03] mn030 | to chan to make any changes .
"[18:06] fn083 | I mean , if y you are coming from Germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance , then you send Jane an email like "" Could you please change this , blah - blah - blah . """
"[18:13] mn030 | Yeah , but it 's much more complicated ."
"[18:14] mn035 | Yeah , but that 's that 's"
[18:15] mn035 | effort .
"[18:16] mn035 | That 's the whole problem , that nobody wants to do it ."
[18:16] mn030 | Yeah .
[18:19] mn082 | Yeah .
"[18:19] fn083 | Yeah , OK ."
[18:19] mn082 | You know how it you know the process here within the NSA group .
[18:23] fn083 | Yes .
[18:24] mn082 | And and that was a reason I we finally decided
[18:27] mn082 | here
"[18:28] mn082 | that we put it information on the N S A page , we have discuss dis this discussed still a couple of months ago ago ."
[18:32] mn030 | I think
[18:33] mn030 | the best solution is really to put a link on the
[18:36] mn081 | Yeah .
[18:37] mn030 | ICSI page
[18:38] mn035 | Yep .
[18:38] mn030 | to this
[18:39] mn030 | stuff .
"[18:40] mn030 | And the stuff itself is , uh ,"
[18:43] mn030 | located at our server .
[18:46] mn082 | In our directory .
"[18:47] mn030 | Yeah ,"
"[18:47] mn030 | in our directory ,"
[18:47] mn082 | Yeah .
[18:48] mn030 | yeah .
"[18:48] mn082 | Yeah , we can do that . We then create a link and then we have to ask with Jane , OK ?"
"[18:48] fn083 | Yes , also fine ."
[18:52] fn083 | Yeah . Another point is I want I want to would like to add
"[18:56] fn083 | a another button , something which is called like "" events "" or ,"
"[19:00] fn083 | I don't know ,"
"[19:01] fn083 | yeah , I guess I call it "" events "" like"
[19:01] mn021 | Hmm ?
[19:03] fn083 | where we could s
"[19:03] fn083 | uh ,"
"[19:04] fn083 | announce talks which are ,"
"[19:07] fn083 | you know ,"
"[19:12] fn083 | for instance the two workshops which have going on ,"
"[19:15] fn083 | uh ,"
"[19:16] fn083 | last summer ,"
"[19:17] fn083 | so ,"
"[19:17] fn083 | Hannes ' workshop and then the workshop from Oliver ,"
"[19:21] fn083 | that there might be a link behind these workshops and or former talks we have ,"
[19:25] fn083 | so like from people who have been here before
"[19:27] fn083 | and he wants to , uh , publish their slides , or an article , or whatsoever , behind there ."
"[19:33] fn083 | So , that we have like a button for events which are where"
"[19:37] fn083 | workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be , um ,"
[19:41] fn083 | shown or
[19:42] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[19:42] fn083 | whatever .
"[19:43] mn082 | Of course that is a living thing . I think it 's a good idea ,"
[19:45] mn082 | not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense .
"[19:51] mn082 | Eh , but I think the idea from Claudia is very good ,"
[19:54] mn082 | that
[19:54] mn082 | the slides
"[19:56] mn082 | from the talks here , if it 's worth to have it on the web , anyway"
"[20:00] mn082 | um , should be published in that way that the people can access it ."
[20:03] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[20:04] mn082 | For instance I have my USAIA slides .
[20:06] mn082 | maybe
"[20:07] mn021 | Yeah , that 's OK , too ."
[20:07] mn082 | if
[20:08] mn082 | some
[20:09] mn082 | things and is going on maybe you have some Multicast slides concerning your work at IGMP and
[20:15] mn082 | uh
"[20:17] mn082 | and if we have some talks from EXTERM ,"
"[20:20] mn082 | and we had some in the past ,"
[20:23] mn082 | we can also put the slides on on
[20:25] mn082 | these things because then they 're still cau
"[20:27] mn082 | still a growing context for us , opportunity for the people you know there ,"
"[20:31] mn082 | "" Oh , this guy did something there ,"
[20:33] mn082 | maybe I can contact him and ask him
"[20:35] mn082 | would you like to do something , contribute , whatever . """
[20:35] mn021 | Hmm - hmm - hmm .
"[20:38] mn082 | Uh , so"
[20:42] mn082 | to have this event page because
[20:44] mn082 | it 's not
"[20:44] mn082 | a big deal ,"
"[20:46] fn083 | No , it 's easy to to add it ,"
[20:48] fn083 | I mean .
"[20:48] mn082 | Nah , OK . If there are no events , then there are no events . But we still have a few which happened in the last year"
"[20:50] fn083 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[20:54] mn082 | and OK , then it is a growing thing but it 's done automatically that the group leader"
"[20:59] mn082 | or the group , uh , put some things eh , also on the web ."
[21:04] mn082 | Something in the center pipe .
[21:07] mn082 | Yeah ?
[21:08] mn082 | Everybody agree ?
"[21:10] mn030 | Um , I don't know . Maybe it could be a good thing"
[21:10] mn021 | OK .
[21:14] mn030 | if we have such an event button
"[21:16] mn030 | that , um ,"
[21:17] mn030 | somewhere beneath this button or
"[21:20] mn030 | wherever ,"
"[21:21] mn030 | that there 's a date ,"
[21:23] mn030 | when the last update was .
[21:25] mn030 | So that you know
[21:26] mn030 | it 's worth to
[21:27] mn030 | click this button
"[21:28] mn030 | to see there 's a new , um ,"
[21:30] mn030 | announcement or not .
"[21:33] fn083 | Yeah , OK ."
"[21:33] mn030 | S So otherwise , you are"
[21:35] mn030 | often clicking this button and you
[21:37] mn030 | get your old information or even an uh empty page .
[21:40] fn083 | Yeah but this will be then
[21:42] fn083 | down on the button of the page anyways .
"[21:44] mn082 | Yeah , maybe we can have "" updated on "" ,"
[21:44] mn030 | So
[21:46] mn082 | you know the button itself ?
"[21:47] mn030 | Yeah , something like that ."
"[21:48] mn082 | And then , "" updated """
"[21:50] mn030 | "" Last updated "" ,"
"[21:50] mn082 | and the current date ,"
[21:51] mn030 | yeah .
[21:51] mn082 | when when something happened .
[21:53] mn082 | I don't know how we deal with that .
[21:53] fn083 | Yep .
[21:54] mn082 | Is it another thing we have to ?
[21:55] fn083 | Yep .
[21:56] mn030 | So it 's just a su suggestion I don't know how
[21:59] mn030 | easy it is to to implement something like that .
[22:02] mn082 | Yeah .
[22:02] fn083 | Huh ! OK .
[22:03] mn082 | OK you Well .
[22:06] mn082 | Let 's consider
[22:16] mn082 | OK .
"[22:18] mn082 | So , and then the next point"
"[22:21] mn082 | and , I believe , yeah ,"
"[22:28] mn082 | not the last one ,"
[22:29] mn082 | @ @
[22:30] mn082 | is one that I would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody
[22:36] mn082 | concerning his
[22:37] mn082 | future intention here
[22:39] mn082 | at ICSI or whether e when he will leave whether he can
"[22:42] mn082 | contri or will he consider currently ,"
"[22:44] mn082 | uh , contribute here to the proposal"
"[22:47] mn082 | because you know , I 've I 'm facing the problem ,"
"[22:49] mn082 | if I go back to Siemens and I say "" OK , there 's a potential . """
"[22:53] mn082 | "" There are potential contacts . """
"[22:54] mn082 | currently , maybe no money ,"
[22:56] mn082 | but if we go in one direction
[23:01] mn082 | if people
[23:02] mn082 | can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever .
[23:09] mn082 | and even if it 's nur unschl
[23:11] mn082 | part - time
"[23:14] mn082 | and if it 's come to a real proposal , that maybe the people can hook in ,"
"[23:18] mn082 | uh , one more time because I need this information definitely t"
"[23:21] mn082 | uh , to inform"
[23:23] mn082 | the
"[23:24] mn082 | uh ,"
[23:25] mn082 | the Siemens management
[23:27] mn082 | that it 's worth to send me back here .
[23:29] mn082 | So maybe Wilbert you can start . You will leave end of January definitely .
"[23:34] mn082 | And currently you see no chance , as far as I know ,"
"[23:38] mn082 | uh , to stay longer here"
[23:40] mn082 | and either you will go back to KPN
"[23:44] mn082 | or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company , is that right ?"
"[23:48] mn081 | Yes ,"
[23:49] mn081 | yeah .
[23:50] mn082 | Can you give us more
[23:51] mn082 | details of concerning the status ?
"[23:54] mn081 | No ,"
[23:54] mn082 | No ?
[23:54] mn081 | no .
[23:57] mn081 | Pending .
[23:58] mn082 | Pending .
[23:59] mn081 | Yeah .
"[24:01] fn083 | See for me it 's the same I can also say , uh ,"
"[24:03] fn083 | for me everything has completely changed , so now I go back and I don't anything what to do ,"
[24:08] fn083 | so it 's like I have to sort everything out when I 'm
[24:12] fn083 | but I won't go back to the university so
[24:13] mn082 | yeah ?
[24:15] fn083 | I don't think so .
[24:15] mn082 | So you are looking for a job . That 's probably then OK .
"[24:18] mn082 | in principle , I would like to say you are lost for the NSA group , because"
[24:18] fn083 | Then it 's like
[24:20] fn083 | yeah .
"[24:21] mn082 | that 's uh ,"
"[24:22] fn083 | Yeah ,"
"[24:23] mn082 | a wonder if , uh ,"
[24:24] fn083 | Yeah .
"[24:24] mn082 | it hook in at the same area , you know ."
"[24:26] mn081 | Uh , but that 's also for me , I 'm kind of lost for the NSA group ."
[24:27] mn082 | Yeah .
[24:28] mn082 | Yeah .
[24:30] mn082 | Yeah .
"[24:30] mn082 | I think so , yeah ."
[24:32] mn081 | also
[24:32] mn082 | Ja
"[24:34] mn082 | from the work contributions , you know ."
"[24:34] mn081 | Well ,"
[24:35] mn081 | b but I think even also K P N .
[24:38] mn081 | i
[24:38] mn082 | Yeah .
"[24:39] mn081 | is lost for the , uh , for the I C S I ."
[24:41] mn082 | Yeah .
[24:42] mn081 | There 's a
"[24:43] mn081 | lot of , uh , z"
[24:44] mn081 | budget cuts going on and
"[24:46] mn081 | nothing is possible anymore , so ."
"[24:49] mn082 | Um , so from your side"
"[24:51] mn082 | the statement is ,"
"[24:52] mn082 | um , that , uh ,"
[24:54] mn082 | independently of your person
"[24:56] mn082 | uh , the KPN is"
[24:58] mn082 | not they 're not willing to send us another guy here to ICSI anyway .
[25:01] mn081 | Yes .
[25:02] mn081 | Absolutely .
"[25:03] mn082 | And , if they are interested in"
"[25:07] mn082 | uh , a certain kind of project"
[25:09] mn082 | then it must be related
[25:11] mn082 | to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing
"[25:17] mn082 | with respect to UMTS , right ?"
[25:18] mn081 | It will be different thing .
[25:20] mn081 | it will be a start - up .
[25:22] mn081 | And I know they 're they 're working on a w
"[25:24] mn081 | a few of them in this area ,"
[25:26] mn081 | but it 's ou outside of ICSI .
[25:28] mn082 | Mmm .
"[25:30] mn082 | So ,"
[25:31] mn082 | KPN and and ICSI
[25:33] mn082 | in principle .
[25:33] mn081 | Yeah .
[25:34] mn082 | After you will leave here that is .
"[25:37] mn082 | Yeah , and then what do you intend to do in the last two months"

"[26:56] mn082 | Mm - hmm ,"
"[26:57] mn082 | and , uh , do you have some students which could be join"
[27:02] mn082 | I assume there is a certain activity . Maybe i if you will leave in July
"[27:05] mn021 | Yeah , well , you know ,"
"[27:06] mn021 | uh the problem the I think that we have a a problem or a difference in Spain , at least ,"
[27:11] mn021 | compared with the Americans .
[27:16] mn021 | are not getting involved
[27:18] mn021 | in research
"[27:19] mn021 | until they have ,"
"[27:21] mn021 | uh , finished their studies ."
[27:28] mn021 | this is the w
[27:28] mn082 | sorry ?
[27:29] mn082 | They are not involved in in research ?
[27:31] mn021 | Yeah .
[27:32] mn082 | What they are doing then ?
[27:33] mn082 | I 'm sorry .
[27:33] mn081 | Lectures .
[27:34] mn082 | Huh ?
"[27:35] mn082 | Ach so , ach so ,"
[27:36] mn082 | OK .
"[27:37] mn021 | You you have to to pass the different tests and you have to study the different subjects . And ,"
[27:42] mn021 | until you have
[27:42] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:45] mn021 | OK ,"
[27:45] mn021 | you can do it
[27:47] mn021 | but the thing is that
[27:48] mn021 | you 're not supposed to do it .
[27:50] mn021 | And usually students are pretty busy
[27:53] mn021 | for not doing other things .
[27:55] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[27:55] mn021 | Uh .
[27:55] mn030 | And there 's no final master 's thesis or something like that
[27:58] mn030 | what they have to perform ?
"[27:58] mn021 | Ah yeah em nnn , not really ."
"[28:01] mn021 | You know ,"
[28:02] mn021 | there is .
"[28:03] mn021 | There is . But ,"
[28:03] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:04] mn021 | uh ,"
[28:05] mn021 | it is not a research work .
[28:06] mn021 | Usually it 's an application work .
[28:09] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:15] mn082 | Why I didn't study in Spain ?
"[28:18] mn021 | But it is not , uh , something your"
"[28:20] mn021 | teacher provides you some research papers and you ,"
[28:21] mn082 | Mmm .
[28:22] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:24] mn021 | let 's say , build a simulator or try to ."
[28:27] mn030 | Mm - hmm .
[28:27] mn082 | Are certain tasks and so ?
[28:27] mn030 | OK .
[28:28] mn021 | So
"[28:29] mn021 | we have , uh , other students are"
"[28:31] mn021 | which are , uh ,"
[28:33] mn021 | mmm
[28:33] mn021 | people that has a grant
"[28:36] mn021 | they are starting as , uh , researchers ,"
"[28:39] mn021 | aaa , but"
[28:40] mn021 | this is
[28:41] mn021 | only connected
[28:42] mn021 | to your own funding so if you if you have projects
[28:44] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:45] mn021 | you can have ,"
"[28:46] mn021 | uh , people working with you . If you don't have ,"
[28:49] mn021 | a research project
"[28:50] mn021 | well , you cannot pay them so u u usually"
[28:53] mn021 | you don't have anybody .
"[28:55] mn021 | So it 's kind of , uh ,"
[28:57] mn021 | dependent
[28:58] mn021 | on
[28:59] mn021 | the funding we have
[29:00] mn021 | in some projects .
[29:02] mn021 | So
[29:02] mn021 | w
[29:02] mn021 | it 's
[29:03] mn082 | Hmm ?
"[29:03] mn021 | not sure ,"
"[29:03] mn082 | No ,"
[29:04] mn021 | not really sure .
[29:04] mn082 | there .
[29:05] mn082 | We 're not talking about to send the students here to I C S I .
"[29:09] mn082 | I 'm talking if there is an activity , at least with the NSA group ,"
[29:13] mn082 | that certain kind of activities also in the university
"[29:17] mn082 | could apply for the master works , of"
"[29:20] mn082 | diplomas thesis , uh , whatever kind of thing"
"[29:20] mn021 | Yeah ,"
"[29:23] mn021 | We could find , uh ,"
"[29:25] mn021 | some , eh work force ."
[29:27] mn021 | OK ?
[29:27] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:28] mn021 | Because well , you you can , eh ,"
[29:30] mn021 | fo redirect
"[29:32] mn021 | you know , the the work as uh"
[29:33] mn021 | let 's say as a subject work of something
"[29:37] mn021 | you can try to , eh , s"
"[29:39] mn021 | In some subjects , in fact ,"
"[29:41] mn021 | eh , the the the , uh , topics are more open so"
[29:48] mn021 | but
[29:48] mn021 | the main thing is that
"[29:49] mn021 | there is a , uh , this"
[29:51] mn021 | big difference
"[29:53] mn021 | because , eh , students are not supposed to do"
"[29:55] mn021 | research , eh , work until they have"
[29:58] mn021 | finished their gra their grade .
[29:58] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:01] mn021 | Yeah , sure ."
"[30:02] mn081 | M uh , maybe you sh"
[30:02] mn021 | Sure .
"[30:03] mn081 | I think it 's pretty healthy for a student to to have a project , eh , where you have to write actually some part of research or ."
"[30:11] mn021 | Yeah , I think so too , but ,"
"[30:13] mn021 | eh , you know , it also depends"
[30:14] mn021 | on the subjects because sometimes
[30:16] mn081 | Sure .
[30:17] mn021 | subjects are fixed
"[30:18] mn021 | so you cannot you cannot , uh"
[30:18] mn081 | OK .
"[30:20] mn021 | uh , give any any stuff you want ."
[30:26] mn081 | O
[30:27] mn081 | Of course .
"[30:28] mn021 | but ,"
"[30:28] mn021 | you know ,"
"[30:31] mn021 | in the latest , eh uh , courses"
"[30:34] mn021 | uh , things are probably more open and , well , it it"
[30:37] mn021 | is something that can be changed .
[30:39] mn082 | Mm - hmm . OK . Thank you .
"[30:41] mn082 | Claudia , I still mentioned ,"
"[30:44] mn082 | For me , as I said before"
[30:46] mn082 | I will be funded by a d
"[30:48] mn082 | uh by the ministry of ,"
"[30:51] mn082 | uh , the German government for research in the project so - called Invinet"
[30:55] mn082 | That seems to be sure .
[30:57] mn082 | And I got
[30:57] mn082 | absolutely freedom
[30:59] mn082 | to do
"[30:59] mn082 | what I would like to do ,"
[31:01] mn082 | and I would like to go on with the QS in advance mechanism
"[31:04] mn082 | and , uh ,"
[31:06] mn082 | in the
[31:06] mn082 | relation of USAIA I also have the
[31:09] mn082 | activities with Georgia Tech .
"[31:11] mn082 | They have now a PHD . It is settled ,"
"[31:14] mn082 | and my other next , uh , generation of contract"
[31:18] mn082 | is also going in that sense so the topic is still going go going on .
"[31:22] mn082 | and when I will come back here , I would like to use these things too to maybe come to a"
"[31:28] mn082 | closer , a bigger project"
[31:35] mn082 | first of all from the NSA group and then from from other partners .
[31:39] mn082 | But this I have definitely ou uh discussed with my management
"[31:43] mn082 | and this will happened ,"
"[31:45] mn082 | I believe , in December ,"
"[31:47] mn082 | maybe , and in the beginning of January ."
"[31:50] mn082 | and I will keep informed to the management of ICSI anyway ,"
"[31:53] mn082 | but also ,"
[31:55] mn082 | I assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference
[31:59] mn082 | and email exchange during that time
[32:02] mn082 | so that we can
[32:04] mn082 | inform each other
"[32:06] mn082 | concerning what are the questions , what are the problems , what is the status and so on ."
[32:11] mn082 | Uh ? But
[32:11] mn082 | I think we will
[32:13] mn082 | uh
[32:14] mn082 | detail these things
[32:16] mn082 | then in one of the last meetings .
[32:20] mn082 | So
[32:21] mn030 | Yeah .
[32:23] mn030 | Well
[32:33] mn030 | So I will stay here
[32:34] mn030 | till the end of February
[32:36] mn030 | and
"[32:37] mn030 | afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm"
"[32:40] mn030 | yeah , funded by an institution of the German government , so ,"
"[32:44] mn030 | they are paying me ,"
"[32:46] mn030 | and I have to do research for them , of course . I have to"
[32:49] mn030 | um
"[32:52] mn030 | well , uh ,"
[32:53] mn030 | reach some goals and so on .
[32:56] mn030 | But on the other hand there will be some
[33:02] mn030 | this area I started here .
"[33:05] mn030 | And for me , myself , I 'm"
[33:07] mn030 | also very interested in in continue this work
[33:10] mn030 | and so that will
[33:13] mn030 | be manageable
"[33:14] mn030 | and , um ,"
[33:15] mn030 | on the other hand there are also
"[33:20] mn030 | well ,"
"[33:20] mn030 | at the moment it 's quite difficult to find students , eh , who are doing their master 's thesis and so on"
"[33:27] mn030 | because there are not a lot of students , uh , which are in this state in Germany now ,"
"[33:32] mn030 | but um ,"
[33:33] mn030 | about
[33:34] mn030 | two years ago the
[33:37] mn030 | numbers of students
"[33:39] mn030 | were , um , studying computer science ,"
"[33:42] mn030 | uh ,"
[33:43] mn030 | started to increase again and
[33:44] mn030 | so in
"[33:46] mn030 | one or two years we will have ,"
"[33:48] mn030 | uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis and so"
"[33:52] mn030 | I think there will also be , uh ,"
[33:54] mn030 | many students
[33:55] mn030 | which are joining in this work .
"[33:58] mn030 | So , hopefully ,"
"[34:00] mn030 | uh , I will found will find some students which are"
"[34:07] mn030 | So ,"
[34:08] mn030 | hopefully this work will be go on .
"[34:09] mn082 | Mm - hmm . OK , sounded good to me ."
[34:12] mn082 | And Michael ?
"[34:13] mn035 | So , I won't change the topic then ."
[34:15] mn035 | I 'm here until
[34:18] mn035 | end of May
"[34:19] mn035 | and after that I presumably going to a Siemens project with some department of gee - mens , but related to that"
[34:27] mn035 | topic
"[34:27] mn035 | what I have done here . So ,"
"[34:29] mn035 | it 's some of pre - stage to that , so it might be more"
[34:34] mn035 | related or loosely related . So it 's
[34:36] mn035 | at least it 's in the same topic .
"[34:39] mn035 | And progress , it 's going on ,"
[34:44] mn035 | but it 's not that fast going on as I would have like it .
[34:47] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:47] mn035 | Oh ,"
[34:49] mn035 | I would like to have it . Sorry .
[34:50] mn035 | Well
[34:51] mn035 | but oder ?
"[34:53] mn082 | Yeah , then , what is the current status anyway ?"
[34:55] mn082 | @ @ this is .
"[34:55] mn035 | Um , I 'm currently I 'm looking into"
"[34:59] mn035 | Quality of Service Routing , and I had discussions with a post - doc from the U - UCB ."
"[35:04] mn035 | Well ,"
[35:06] mn035 | we started to
[35:08] mn035 | collect information to
[35:10] mn035 | write the paper about Quality of Serving routing .
[35:13] mn035 | for MPLS in an MPLS domain .
[35:15] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:15] mn035 | So you have um distributed routing at the edges ,"
[35:20] mn035 | and
[35:21] mn035 | one aspect
[35:22] mn035 | is
"[35:23] mn035 | that the information is outdated , so that you know to always have the"
"[35:27] mn035 | exact information of your links , dates , and so on ."
[35:31] mn035 | It what we have plans of that .
[35:33] mn035 | And trying to
"[35:34] mn035 | look at some routing policies ,"
[35:38] mn035 | or routing algorithms .
[35:39] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:41] mn082 | Now as I see , in principle , uh"
[35:45] mn082 | that 's a really raw view .
"[35:46] mn082 | MPLS offers certain kind of success of active routing , because"
"[35:50] mn082 | in principle , the"
[35:51] mn082 | forwarding pass is a little bit
[35:54] mn035 | Yeah .
"[35:57] mn082 | OK , it 's it 's not"
[35:59] mn082 | really the subject but in a broader sense it could be seen
[36:01] mn035 | It d yeah .
[36:02] mn082 | in that sense . I think
"[36:04] mn082 | uh , there are"
[36:06] mn082 | in a certain degree
"[36:07] mn082 | some alignment with with both of you guys , right ?"
[36:09] mn035 | Yeah .
[36:10] mn035 | So at least from the desh
"[36:12] mn035 | definition of Christian Tschudin , MPLS is a"
[36:17] mn035 | of
[36:17] mn035 | active route
[36:19] mn035 | active routing .
"[36:20] mn035 | So it 's very It 's static ? It 's No , active ?"
[36:23] mn035 | But it 's sort of active because they have these program
[36:25] mn082 | Yeah .
[36:27] mn035 | statements .
"[36:28] mn082 | Yeah , maybe it 's a separation , in principle , that I do not use the normal traditional ,"
[36:29] mn035 | But y
[36:30] mn035 | Yeah .
[36:33] mn035 | Yeah .
"[36:33] mn082 | uh , data forwarding pass"
"[36:35] mn082 | and update , in principle , only the routing information"
"[36:38] mn021 | Well , they are they are using"
"[36:38] mn082 | uh , to to to use it ."
[36:39] mn021 | the the the same idea of labelling packets
[36:40] mn082 | Yeah .
[36:42] mn082 | Yeah .
[36:43] mn035 | Yeah .
[36:44] mn021 | with a
[36:45] mn021 | content descriptor or something .
[36:47] mn035 | That 's right .
"[36:47] mn082 | Yeah , so what I mean is at a certain degree ,"
[36:49] mn021 | Yeah .
"[36:50] mn082 | yeah , that has to be figured out ."
"[36:52] mn082 | There is , uh , there are some linkage between them ."
[36:54] mn082 | @ @
[36:54] mn021 | Mm - hmm .
[36:55] mn082 | your work .
[36:56] mn035 | Yeah .
"[36:57] mn082 | So ,"
"[36:58] mn082 | my last point , uh , in principle , is the proposal itself ."
[37:02] mn082 | Um
"[37:04] mn082 | I know , in the past it was always if I 'm"
[37:07] mn082 | not writing something nothing gonna happen .
"[37:10] mn082 | So , I believe , Wilbert , you are going out of these activity ."
[37:14] mn082 | You have to use your time
[37:16] mn082 | to
[37:17] mn082 | finish your work as you
"[37:20] mn082 | uh ,"
[37:21] mn082 | have in mind until your
"[37:23] mn082 | end of February , or is that right ?"
"[37:25] mn081 | January , yes ."
"[37:26] mn082 | End of January , sorry , so you will not y"
[37:28] mn082 | you will not find any time to contribute anymore to this
[37:31] mn081 | No .
[37:31] mn082 | activity .
[37:34] mn082 | OK .
[37:35] mn082 | Then from Miguel 's side
[37:38] mn082 | I expect more
[37:39] mn082 | detailed vision .
"[37:41] mn082 | We can do it , as I mentioned before , bilateral afterwards ,"
"[37:44] mn082 | uh , concerning your work and how you think it could be"
[37:48] mn082 | beneficial contribution to the activity
[37:51] mn082 | maybe based on the generic
"[37:53] mn082 | uh , uh , USAIA architecture ."
[37:56] mn082 | I will write
[37:58] mn082 | as
"[38:00] mn082 | long as I have time here ,"
"[38:02] mn082 | uh , on the proposal itself and in the near - term future ,"
[38:05] mn082 | I will
[38:07] mn082 | distribute a list
[38:09] mn082 | of the
[38:11] mn082 | small cluster
[38:13] mn082 | of people .
[38:14] mn082 | I tried to access
[38:16] mn082 | Juan Peire
"[38:17] mn082 | several times ,"
"[38:19] mn082 | he didn't answer , because he still had mentioned that there 's some minor funding ,"
"[38:24] mn082 | that I think would help ,"
"[38:27] mn082 | for instance , to have initial meeting"
[38:29] mn082 | either here or in Europe or or wherever .
"[38:32] mn082 | I 've , uh , contact"
"[38:40] mn082 | uh , L Landay mentioned , uh ,"
[38:42] mn035 | L Lan -
[38:42] mn035 | Landay ?
"[38:42] mn082 | Rao , right ?"
[38:44] mn082 | Yeah .
"[38:44] mn082 | because he 's a professor in uh , responsible for the infrastructure at UCB and he has some projects"
[38:45] mn035 | Landay .
[38:49] mn035 | Ah .
[38:50] mn082 | which are related to
"[38:52] mn082 | um , these these , uh , activities"
[38:56] mn082 | I would c c name it cor intelligent classroom .
[38:59] mn082 | I don't know whether I can succeed to get an appointment then
[39:05] mn082 | contact list and @ @ the interests of each partner
[39:09] mn082 | so that everybody can see
[39:10] mn082 | and
"[39:11] mn082 | everybody knows , yeah , I have in mind"
[39:13] mn082 | maybe it 's a small NSA group activity
"[39:15] mn082 | itself ,"
[39:16] mn082 | with no linkage to the outer world
[39:18] mn082 | maybe it 's a NSA group activity with a linkage to the outer world
[39:22] mn082 | based on the
[39:24] mn082 | uh universities at home or the companies at home
[39:27] mn082 | there 's some linkage
"[39:29] mn082 | and the third stage is , let 's say there 's a NSA group activity in this area ,"
"[39:33] mn082 | uh , with the supported , um ,"
[39:36] mn082 | home entities
[39:38] mn082 | and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or u or universities here in this area .
"[39:44] mn082 | The last one , I think it 's , uh , the best one ."
"[39:48] mn082 | But , you see the question is always "" Where 's the money ? """
"[39:50] mn082 | and I say "" Oh poo , currently I don't know . """
"[39:53] mn082 | The second question is how long I stay here and say ooo , I don't know "" ,"
[39:56] mn082 | so
[39:57] mn082 | everybody 's waiting .
"[39:59] mn082 | Yeah , and the only rea"
"[40:00] mn082 | um ,"
"[40:01] mn082 | activity could come from the NSA group itself ,"
"[40:04] mn082 | but I think it 's a a work in process and that it will take some time and , uh ,"
[40:08] mn082 | everything must be just settled a little bit more .
"[40:10] mn082 | So , but anyway , I would like to get contributions"
"[40:13] mn082 | from the people here of the NSA group concerning proposals , this is a living thing"
[40:19] mn082 | and
[40:20] mn082 | it 's a pity
"[40:21] mn082 | that Multicast is , in principle , removed"
[40:24] mn082 | and we do not have any expert from Multicast anymore .
"[40:27] mn082 | And , uh , that 's makes very hard , I believe ."
"[40:31] mn082 | Because that is a major @ @ ,"
[40:34] mn082 | at least twenty - five percent of the whole network
"[40:37] mn082 | uh , stuff"
"[40:39] mn082 | and , um , but neverless we have to live with this situation ."
[40:46] mn082 | Right .
[40:47] mn081 | Right .
[40:48] mn081 | Right .
"[40:50] mn082 | So maybe we have to rewrite something , have new ideas going forward more in"
"[40:55] mn082 | certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and QS stuff ,"
"[41:00] mn082 | and remove , in principle , the Multicast stuff"
[41:07] mn082 | mmm
[41:07] mn082 | source of research work
[41:10] mn082 | for the future telecommunication core networks because
"[41:14] mn082 | they are still not able to deal with Multicast , they still have there that"
[41:21] mn082 | and I I believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the
"[41:25] mn082 | really uh , mobile scenarios in in that network ,"
[41:28] mn082 | so but anyway we have to live with a real situation and that means we have to
[41:31] mn082 | drop Multicast from the proposal .
[41:38] mn082 | Any comments ?
"[41:41] mn021 | Oh , not really , you know ,"
"[41:45] mn021 | Well , in the future ,"
[41:46] mn021 | somebody will come
[41:47] mn021 | to the NSA group
[41:49] mn021 | eh
[41:51] mn082 | Then we can extend the proposal one more time with Multicast .
"[41:52] mn021 | Ah ,"
"[41:55] mn021 | OK ,"
[41:55] mn021 | I I I think that
"[41:57] mn021 | it cannot , eh , be , eh considered the first type task to do because"
[42:01] mn021 | nobody is is knowledgeable about multicasting but
"[42:05] mn021 | I think that , eh , any of us"
[42:07] mn021 | could
"[42:07] mn021 | address these things in the future ,"
[42:09] mn021 | or maybe
[42:10] mn021 | a new person could address this .
[42:12] mn021 | in the future . So
"[42:14] mn021 | I mean ,"
"[42:15] mn021 | wh what I think is that ,"
"[42:16] mn021 | uh , it it makes no sense to me"
"[42:19] mn021 | to reduce ,"
"[42:20] mn021 | uh , uh , uh , uh ,"
[42:22] mn021 | something which is more or less
"[42:24] mn021 | complete ,"
"[42:29] mn021 | to go is probably the opposite , to try to find"
[42:32] mn021 | something which has
[42:34] mn021 | a meaning by itself
[42:35] mn021 | and then try to get
[42:39] mn021 | to do
"[42:40] mn082 | Oh , maybe you understand me in the wrong way ."
"[42:42] mn082 | Uh ,"
"[42:43] mn082 | I do not mean to drop it , to remove the text from the proposal ."
"[42:46] mn021 | OK ,"
[42:47] mn021 | OK .
"[42:47] mn082 | I mean , activities , planning activities ."
[42:48] mn021 | Sorry .
"[42:49] mn021 | Yeah ,"
[42:49] mn021 | that 's OK .
[42:50] mn082 | Work packages .
"[42:50] mn021 | Sorry , sorry , heh ?"
"[42:51] mn082 | Yeah ,"
[42:51] mn021 | Now I
[42:51] mn082 | so
"[42:52] mn082 | no , no , because that 's , uh , that 's why I mentioned that it is important thing ."
"[42:56] mn082 | But , currently there 's only one"
"[42:59] mn082 | new group member ,"
"[43:00] mn082 | Sven Buchholz ,"
"[43:01] mn082 | who will figure out the thing ,"
[43:04] mn082 | hmm
"[43:05] mn082 | how to say ,"
"[43:06] mn082 | um , the"
"[43:10] mn082 | taking into account the end system ,"
[43:12] mn082 | or the limited end system capabilities
[43:15] mn082 | with respect to mobility and the network itself .
"[43:19] mn082 | Where it should be ada @ @ where should be , uh , the adaptation process performed"
"[43:24] mn082 | to deal with the different devices ,"
[43:26] mn082 | for ubiquitous access to the network ? Should it be in the end system itself ?
[43:31] mn082 | Should be in the edge device ? It should it be in the core ? should it be on the server ?
[43:34] mn082 | These are the questions he would like to figure out .
"[43:37] mn082 | And to p uh , to have , in principle , the pro and cons"
"[43:41] mn082 | of , uh , different of all these different approaches ."
[43:44] mn082 | So that 's the only
[43:46] mn082 | new member .
[43:47] mn081 | Who is that ?
[43:49] mn082 | Sven Buchholz .
[43:50] mn082 | He was here . I invited him and discussed with him
[43:53] mn082 | his potential
[43:56] mn082 | quite sure
"[43:56] mn081 | Oh , he was here one day ."
[43:57] mn082 | Yeah .
[43:58] fn083 | Yeah .
[43:58] mn035 | Hmm .
"[43:59] mn082 | But he showed up the next day but only for administration stuff , but for the technical discussion he was here one day ."
[43:59] mn035 | Several days .
[44:01] mn035 | Yeah .
[44:01] mn035 | Yeah .
[44:04] mn035 | Yeah .
"[44:06] fn083 | That must be three weeks ago ,"
[44:08] fn083 | cuz I r
"[44:08] mn081 | Yeah , I do remember him , but I didn't talk with him about , uh about the research"
[44:09] fn083 | I just met him when I arrived .
[44:09] mn035 | Yeah .
[44:12] mn082 | Mm - hmm .
[44:14] mn081 | topic .
[44:16] mn081 | So I didn't know what he was going to do .

"[44:22] mn082 | mid of January , I believe , yeah ,"
[44:24] mn035 | Mm - hmm .
[44:24] mn082 | as far as I know .
"[44:26] mn082 | So , but this is the only guy , you know ,"
[44:28] mn082 | but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text .
[44:31] mn082 | @ @
[44:32] mn021 | OK .
[44:42] mn082 | more detailed descriptions .
[44:45] mn082 | So
[44:46] mn082 | Any other question ?
[44:47] mn082 | Any other comment ?
[44:52] mn082 | Oh .
[44:56] mn082 | Then we pu should start with reading the numbers
[45:00] mn082 | one more time .
"[45:01] fn083 | Oh , again ?"
"[45:03] mn082 | Yes , we have to do it , so that means we have to read the transcript script"
[45:03] fn083 | I don't know .
"[45:07] mn082 | number and then the numbers ,"
[45:09] mn082 | and if there 's a
"[45:10] mn082 | new line , a short break ."
"[45:13] mn082 | And , afterwards we have to ,"
"[45:15] mn082 | uh , that device is switched on , so please do not"
[45:20] mn082 | switch off the devices .

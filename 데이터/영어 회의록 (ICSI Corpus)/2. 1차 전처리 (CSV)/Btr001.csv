"[00:00] me011 | OK , you 're on ."
[00:01] fe008 | OK .
"[00:02] me011 | And , do you have my number ?"
"[00:03] fe008 | Um , w would you mind telling me again , please ?"
"[00:09] fe008 | Oh , he 's gonna write it . OK ."
"[00:15] fe008 | Now , if the batteries were to go out during the meeting , there 's really what do we do ?"
[00:20] me011 | Put a new one in .
[00:22] fe008 | Do we have batteries back there ? OK .
"[00:24] fe008 | OK . And you 'll be in your office during this ? Oh , thank you very much ."
"[00:26] me011 | Actually , I 'll probably get some coffee then I 'll be back ."
[00:28] fe008 | Thanks a lot . Appreciate it . Could you close the door for me please ?
[00:28] fe066 | What 's so what do we do with this ? Anything ?
"[00:30] fe067 | Just put your name on it , I think ."
"[00:31] fe066 | Oh , OK ."
"[00:35] fe008 | OK , thanks ."
[00:35] fe067 | Uh - huh .
"[00:42] fe008 | let 's see , so ,"
"[00:44] fe008 | um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um ,"
"[00:47] fe008 | @ @ benefit from your involvement in the data , all the things that that you 've been exposed to in these many months ."
"[00:53] fe008 | And um , I just I just put down some ideas you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier ."
"[01:00] fe008 | And , um ,"
[01:01] fe068 | Mmm .
"[01:01] fe008 | none of these these are not obligatory toca topics but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss , just as a way of organizing the discussion ."
[01:09] fe008 | But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too .
"[01:12] fe008 | Alright , so um ,"
"[01:13] fe008 | it struck me that , um ,"
"[01:15] fe008 | you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about ,"
"[01:19] fe008 | um , things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or ,"
"[01:27] fe008 | uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type ."
"[01:30] fe008 | And then , maybe talk about specifics specifics of the data"
"[01:33] fe008 | and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions"
[01:38] fe008 | and then the technical
"[01:39] fe008 | set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface ."
"[01:43] fe008 | OK , so ,"
"[01:45] fe008 | maybe we could just , um , start with"
[01:52] fe008 | What what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ?
"[01:58] fe069 | One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms ."
[02:06] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[02:09] fe069 | it 's a field that
"[02:13] fe069 | I don't know , I don't know very much about this kind of stuff computers and"
[02:17] fe069 | speech recognition . I 've never taken
"[02:19] fe069 | classes on it or anything , so . I found that really hard ."
[02:22] fe069 | And
"[02:22] fe069 | I remember transcribing and having a bunch of You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was ."
[02:30] fe069 | So .
"[02:30] fe008 | Parentheses , meaning uncertainty ."
[02:31] fe069 | Yeah .
"[02:32] fe069 | Yeah , but it 's definitely gotten easier because"
[02:32] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[02:33] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:35] fe069 | the same things keep getting repeated , once you learn what it is , and you can say , "" OK"
"[02:38] fe069 | I know what they meant by that "" or "" I know how to spell that now "" or something like that ."
[02:43] fe069 | And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful
[02:44] fe068 | Yeah .
[02:46] fe069 | also .
[02:46] me070 | Yeah .
"[02:47] fe008 | OK , good ."
"[02:48] fe008 | It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ? It 's basically you have these"
[02:50] fe069 | Yeah .
"[02:59] fe069 | Especially when describing like the set - up in this room , also , and the different types of mikes ."
[02:59] fe008 | Yeah .
[03:05] fe069 | I don't know .
[03:06] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[03:06] fe069 | And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly . They just
[03:10] fe069 | glide over some of the letters . They don't fully pronounce them . So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times
[03:13] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[03:13] fe067 | Hmm .
[03:16] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[03:17] me070 | Yeah . I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses cuz I think it 's
[03:17] fe069 | what it is .
[03:22] fe069 | Uh - huh .
[03:23] me070 | people can say their acronyms really fast and
"[03:25] me070 | I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said ,"
[03:29] me070 | it 's probably best to put them in parentheses cuz I probably don't .
"[03:32] fe008 | That 's not a bad strategy . I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context ."
[03:38] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[03:39] me070 | Right .
[03:39] fe067 | Hmm .
[03:41] fe008 | Not a bad strategy .
[03:42] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[03:43] fe008 | Yeah .
"[03:43] fe068 | Some of them just occurred over and over the again , so like PDA ."
[03:46] fe008 | Yes .
[03:47] fe068 | Like that
[03:47] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[03:52] fe008 | I suspect in context .
"[03:52] fe068 | They just kept getting repeated often and often you know , over and over , so . Just got better , but ."
[03:55] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[03:55] me070 | Yeah .
[04:04] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[04:04] fe069 | Yeah .
[04:05] fe008 | is probably likely to be the one that you had .
"[04:14] fe008 | Well these here are the P Z Ms , that right there ."
[04:16] me070 | Oh .
[04:17] fe066 | Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote Crown microphones that people used to be Yeah .
[04:20] fe068 | No .
"[04:24] fe008 | No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um ,"
"[04:27] fe008 | that they 're not in circulation right now , that they 're they were unpopular ."
"[04:31] fe008 | I liked them , and Adam liked them . I thought the quality was good ."
[04:31] fe066 | Huh .
"[04:32] fe066 | Oh . Oh , OK ."
[04:34] me070 | Hmm .
"[04:35] fe008 | yeah , what did he say ? He said some more things about that , but I was n I was working on something else . Uh - huh ."
[04:38] fe069 | About the microphone ?
[04:41] fe069 | I can't remember . I mean he 's e
[04:45] fe069 | a specific sized head ?
"[04:46] fe008 | Ah , yeah . Yeah , that 's right ."
[04:47] fe069 | Right ?
[04:47] me070 | Yeah .
"[04:48] fe069 | And so if if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine and if it w was bigger , then it was like"
[04:48] fe008 | That 's right .
[04:48] fe066 | Oh .
[04:53] fe066 | Oh .
[04:54] fe068 | Right .
[04:55] fe069 | o or I don't know .
[04:56] fe069 | I don't know .
"[04:57] fe008 | I liked them . And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the"
[05:00] fe008 | wall right there .
[05:01] me070 | Hmm .
[05:02] fe008 | So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back .
"[05:04] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
"[05:04] fe066 | Oh , OK ."
"[05:06] fe008 | Yeah , good c"
"[05:06] fe069 | Oh , it doesn't look so bad , but , I guess it depends really ."
[05:10] fe008 | Yeah .
"[05:11] fe008 | OK , so now what about accents ?"
"[05:13] fe008 | Do you have , uh Did you find any p"
[05:15] fe066 | They 're tough sometimes .
[05:16] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[05:16] me070 | Yeah .
"[05:17] fe066 | Sometimes the German accents can get a little bit daunting . I mean ,"
"[05:21] fe066 | um ,"
"[05:23] fe066 | I forget who it was that I was transcribing but , it was tough to figure out what e e he was saying ,"
"[05:28] fe066 | uh , at any given point in time and I would"
"[05:31] fe066 | I would just listen to it over and over and over again , going "" Oh my God ! My head 's gonna explode ! "" like ,"
[05:36] fe066 | not really understanding a
[05:37] me070 | Yeah .
[05:38] fe066 | you know ?
[05:39] fe066 | And so
[05:39] fe066 | I was getting a little frustrated because
"[05:47] fe066 | you know , I I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can and"
[05:52] fe066 | I I just felt like
"[05:53] fe066 | you know , with the German accents , just for me personally , those were probably the toughest"
[05:58] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[05:58] fe066 | to get around .
"[06:00] fe066 | Um , they weren't impossible but just like they too the m they took the most time too ."
[06:05] fe066 | I mean I would take maybe twice as long on a a g given channel w with a speaker who has a German accent than somebody who 's
[06:07] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[06:08] fe069 | Hm - hmm .
"[06:14] fe066 | or even Asian like , uh , speaks an En - Asian language . I found that easier ."
"[06:18] fe066 | Uh , you know ."
"[06:20] fe066 | Uh , somebody who speaks like Chinese or something , @ @ ."
"[06:22] fe008 | What 's you 've studied some languages , which which ones do you are you studying ? It 's more of a Romance direction , or ?"
[06:23] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:27] fe066 | Um , yeah well , I studied I mean , I studied Old English for a while . Um ,"
[06:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[06:33] fe066 | and then I 've worked with Larry Hyman on like some of the Bantu languages .
"[06:37] fe066 | Um , and you know , I 'm also working with Ian Maddieson and he 's been doing work on"
[06:37] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[06:41] fe066 | the , uh ,"
[06:42] fe066 | like also some African languages . So I 've like learned a little bit .
"[06:44] fe008 | Mm - hmm , so it 's not really you 're not really exposed to German very much ."
[06:50] fe008 | Ah ! Interesting . Interesting .
[06:52] fe008 | Huh .
[06:55] fe008 | OK .
[06:56] fe069 | That 's interesting .
[06:57] fe068 | Hmm - hmm .
[06:58] fe069 | Yeah .
[07:01] fe069 | Yeah .
[07:02] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[07:02] fe067 | Hmm .
[07:02] me070 | Huh .
[07:03] fe069 | For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest .
[07:05] fe068 | Yeah .
"[07:09] fe069 | I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German ,"
[07:11] fe066 | Oh .
"[07:19] fe069 | if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , "" Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this "" and then I figured out what they were saying ."
[07:24] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[07:28] fe069 | I 've never taken Spanish , and even though I 've taken French ,"
"[07:30] fe069 | and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much"
[07:36] fe069 | maybe also because
[07:38] fe069 | the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ? I think
[07:46] fe069 | There was a couple of different Spanish speakers .
"[07:47] fe068 | Can we give names ? We w we probably shouldn't , right ?"
"[07:51] fe008 | I it 's a good question . Um ,"
"[07:58] me070 | who I find the hardest to transcribe of all , and it 's d she 's Spanish ."
[08:03] me070 | So .
"[08:03] fe068 | Oh yeah , OK ."
"[08:04] me070 | And , um , and I 've"
"[08:09] me070 | when I correct it , I"
[08:10] me070 | can t
"[08:12] me070 | tell that the person who , um , transcribed it before me probably"
"[08:23] me070 | pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a you know , a Spanish speaker 's"
"[08:27] me070 | mind that you would , you know , pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish . But the same time ,"
"[08:33] fe069 | Huh , that 's really interesting ."
"[08:33] fe008 | Oh , that 's fascinating ."
[08:34] fe066 | Huh .
[08:34] me070 | I find it one of one of the hardest ones to transcribe .
[08:41] me070 | Yeah .
[08:41] fe066 | Oh OK .
"[08:41] fe069 | I think so , yeah ."
"[08:42] fe008 | Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting . I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others because of my c exposure and interest in German ."
[08:44] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[08:47] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[08:50] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[08:50] fe069 | Yeah .
"[08:50] fe008 | But , um ,"
[08:51] me070 | Right .
"[08:51] fe066 | Maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish woman , I don't know if I have ."
[08:59] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[08:59] fe008 | actually she she was in the middle phase I would say . We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult .
[09:02] me070 | Hmm .
[09:03] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[09:04] fe069 | Yeah .
[09:05] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:05] fe069 | Yeah , he was hard ."
[09:06] fe008 | But that 's really interesting .
[09:09] fe069 | Yeah .
"[09:13] fe069 | And you got to know his pronunciation of them . I remember , yeah ."
"[09:14] fe068 | Yeah . So when he said "" sign - yah "" ,"
[09:16] fe008 | Yes . Yes yes yes .
"[09:16] fe068 | and it sounds like "" sign "" , he was saying "" signal "" ."
[09:18] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[09:18] fe008 | Ex -
"[09:18] fe069 | Yeah , I remember that . And and m eh the way he said "" mixed "" was really strange , too . "" Miss - ed "" or somethi yeah ."
"[09:19] fe068 | And so I would transcribe it as "" signal "" ."
[09:19] fe008 | exactly .
[09:19] fe066 | Huh .
"[09:22] fe068 | "" Meexe "" , "" meese "" , "" mees - uh "" , or something . Right ."
"[09:23] me070 | "" Miss - """
[09:24] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[09:25] fe069 | Yeah .
[09:28] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[09:28] fe066 | That 's kinda cool .
"[09:29] fe069 | Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand ,"
"[09:33] fe069 | and then everyone would say , "" What was that again ? "" and then they 'd pronounce it in English and so I could"
[09:39] fe068 | Yeah .
[09:40] fe069 | that way .
"[09:41] fe008 | Yeah , interesting ."
[09:44] fe008 | OK .
"[09:44] fe068 | Yeah , I mean he was never like it was never up to like a native speaker , but like that it got a little easier ."
"[09:51] fe068 | Um I remember in the beginning you had and you were just sorta like you were beating your head against the wall , but I it go but it got better , it got better ."
[09:51] fe069 | Like his English fluency got better ?
"[09:55] fe069 | Oh , I went crazy ."
[09:58] fe069 | I I would
[09:59] fe069 | skip doing that
[10:00] fe069 | portion for as long as I could because
"[10:00] fe068 | Yeah , I know . Yeah . I remember ."
[10:03] fe069 | i
[10:04] fe068 | Yeah .
"[10:05] fe008 | Yeah , I had the same experience ."
[10:06] fe069 | Yeah .
"[10:09] fe008 | Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , "" What did you say there ? "" and they can't tell you ."
[10:14] fe069 | And they won't know .
[10:15] fe008 | S I think it 's it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level .
[10:15] me070 | Mmm .
[10:16] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[10:17] fe066 | Oh .
[10:18] fe069 | Hmm .
[10:19] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[10:19] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[10:20] fe069 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[10:20] me070 | @ @
[10:21] me070 | Yeah .
[10:21] fe008 | I also wonder if if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has
"[10:25] fe008 | different pronunciations in different regions ? I mean , do you think that , um ,"
"[10:29] fe008 | that , uh ,"
[10:35] me070 | Mmm .
[10:45] fe008 | a contributing factor .
[10:46] me070 | I don't know .
"[10:47] fe066 | Oh , like the region ?"
"[10:47] fe069 | I have no idea about Spain , but I know that in France for example"
[10:48] fe008 | Yeah .
[10:51] fe069 | Parisian French is much easier for me to understand cuz I learned it versus
[10:55] fe069 | France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like
[10:56] fe066 | Sure .
[10:59] fe066 | Right .
[11:02] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:03] fe068 | Or in Quebec , right ? In Canada it 'd be it 's different . A lot of the pronunciations are different , yeah ."
[11:04] fe008 | That 's right .
[11:05] fe066 | Right .
[11:06] fe069 | Much different . Yeah .
[11:08] fe069 | Yeah .
"[11:09] fe008 | And in my case with with , uh , German w I a certain region that I do well in and then get farther away from that region and I notice it 's more and more difficult . Yeah ."
[11:13] me070 | Yeah .
[11:14] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:16] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:16] fe066 | There 's another language that 's spoken in Spain too , that 's um , what am I thinking of ?"
[11:20] fe068 | Castillian ?
"[11:21] fe066 | Castillian . Yeah , and uh ,"
[11:23] fe069 | isn't it Catalan ?
[11:24] fe066 | Catalan .
[11:25] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:25] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[11:29] fe066 | ch
"[11:31] fe008 | And , um and didn't say a lot . I mean , I I I c I totally agree . This was a a difficult person to to understand ."
[11:31] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:32] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[11:37] me070 | Yeah .
[11:37] me070 | Yeah .
"[11:38] me070 | Well , the last one I did she actually said a lot , and it was kinda it was very hard to transcribe ."
[11:38] fe069 | Yeah .
[11:39] fe008 | But .
"[11:47] me070 | wa um ,"
"[11:49] me070 | very high up there , so it was really"
[11:52] fe069 | Yeah .
"[11:52] me070 | difficult . But , I mean , I did"
"[11:55] fe008 | I can imagine that , yeah ."
[11:55] fe068 | Hmm .
[11:56] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:01] me070 | how you couldn't understand that "" , but I c"
"[12:05] fe008 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[12:06] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[12:10] fe008 | Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish . I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German ."
[12:12] fe069 | Yeah .
"[12:14] me070 | In German , yeah ."
[12:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[12:18] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[12:20] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[12:23] fe008 | Mm - hmm . That 's right .
[12:23] fe067 | Mmm .
[12:24] fe069 | and it 's hard to catch
[12:30] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[12:33] fe069 | That too .
[12:33] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[12:33] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[12:34] fe069 | That too .
[12:35] fe069 | Yeah .
[12:42] fe066 | He - yeah .
[12:43] me070 | Hmm .
[12:47] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[12:52] fe069 | Especially when they 're when you were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes .
[12:57] fe008 | Oh . Yeah .
[12:57] fe069 | And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking .
[13:00] fe066 | Yeah .
"[13:02] fe008 | Yeah , we had lapels for d l brief And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks ,"
[13:02] fe069 | And that was really hard to deal with .
[13:05] me070 | Hmm .
[13:07] fe008 | which would mean really basically
"[13:09] fe008 | u uh ,"
[13:09] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:09] fe008 | a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others , and also ,"
"[13:10] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
[13:11] fe068 | Right .
"[13:13] fe008 | um , it varying when they change their hea w head position ."
[13:15] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[13:16] fe069 | Yeah .
"[13:17] fe068 | Right . A big im I tha I think the transcriptions improved immensely ,"
"[13:20] fe068 | like exponentially , um , after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel ."
"[13:27] fe069 | Yeah , absolutely ."
"[13:27] fe008 | Oh , excellent . Oh , good to know ."
[13:28] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:29] fe069 | Yeah .
"[13:29] fe067 | Oh , yeah ."
[13:29] fe008 | S
"[13:30] fe008 | so that was You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ? Mm - hmm ."
[13:33] fe068 | Yeah .
[13:33] fe069 | Yeah .
[13:33] me070 | You guys didn't have
[13:34] me070 | o one channel per person before ?
[13:35] fe068 | No .
[13:36] fe068 | No .
"[13:36] fe066 | Oh , wow ."
[13:42] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[13:43] fe069 | Well could you ? Did we didn't do that very much .
[13:44] fe066 | You couldn't visually isolate it ?
[13:45] me070 | What ?
"[13:45] fe069 | You couldn't visually do it , no ."
[13:46] fe066 | Huh .
[13:47] fe068 | No .
"[13:48] fe068 | And you had to mark interruptions by a slash , right ?"
"[13:50] fe008 | Mm - hmm , that 's right ."
[13:52] fe008 | Overlaps .
[13:58] fe068 | Yeah .
"[13:58] fe069 | Cuz there 's m so many men and so few women . The women were easy to f figure out who was who ,"
[14:02] fe069 | and then the men all their voices sounded the same except I think there was one British English speaker
[14:07] fe069 | and that was easy but
"[14:09] me070 | Wow , that 's difficult ."
[14:09] fe069 | Eh . Yeah .
[14:16] fe069 | Yeah .
[14:19] fe069 | An easier time ?
[14:22] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:23] fe068 | I don't know why that would be true , but"
[14:23] fe008 | That 's interesting .
[14:24] fe066 | That 's possible .
"[14:25] fe068 | you wonder if there 'd be like a gender difference there ? I don't know , I 'm thinking about it as like a psychologist I suppose ."
[14:31] fe069 | I don't know .
[14:31] fe008 | It 's possible . Hmm .
"[14:32] fe066 | oh , yeah , yeah , that 's possible ."
[14:34] fe008 | Hmm .
[14:34] fe069 | Yeah .
"[14:34] fe066 | I was just gonna say something . I was gonna say that ,"
"[14:37] fe066 | I mean , it 's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of"
"[14:40] fe066 | somebody 's voice if it 's the same if ,"
"[14:44] fe066 | if that person is the same sex as you . So maybe ,"
[14:46] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:48] fe066 | like , implicitly people pay attention more closely to"
"[14:52] fe066 | uh , speakers of the same sex ."
[14:54] fe068 | Hmm .
[14:55] fe066 | I don't know . I don't know if that 's actually true but I 'm just
[14:59] fe008 | Hmm .
[14:59] fe066 | throwing that out there .
[15:00] fe069 | It 's interesting .
[15:00] fe068 | Huh .
[15:01] fe069 | I don't know .
[15:02] fe008 | Huh .
"[15:05] fe008 | Yeah , it seems like it 's it 's related to this"
[15:07] fe008 | production idea .
"[15:10] fe008 | you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way , but ."
[15:14] fe069 | Yeah .
[15:14] fe008 | Yeah .
"[15:14] fe069 | Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened ."
"[15:16] fe068 | Oh yeah , it was so ea it it became much easier ."
[15:18] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:19] fe068 | Um , you know ."
"[15:21] fe008 | In the prev You 've also gone through They 've been here since the beginning . You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing ."
"[15:28] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
[15:29] fe068 | Right .
[15:29] fe008 | So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well .
[15:32] fe066 | Oh .
"[15:32] me070 | Oh , wow ."
[15:33] fe069 | That took a l
"[15:33] fe068 | Which wasn't as hard . I mean , it took time . It took time ."
[15:33] fe008 | Yeah .
[15:34] fe069 | E No . It just took time . Yeah .
[15:36] me070 | Yeah .
[15:36] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[15:37] fe067 | Hmm .
[15:40] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:40] fe069 | Me too , yeah . Yeah ."
[15:40] fe066 | Me too .
"[15:40] me070 | Yeah , I always adjust the time bins ."
[15:41] fe067 | Yeah .
[15:42] fe069 | Yeah .
[15:45] fe066 | Yeah .
[15:45] fe067 | Really ?
"[15:47] fe068 | the person started to say something , it 's a very slight difference , and then the time bin starts ."
[15:52] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:52] fe069 | Yeah , that happens a lot ."
[15:52] me070 | Yeah right .
[15:52] fe067 | Hmm .
[15:52] fe066 | Right .
"[15:52] fe068 | Um , so you have to just move it back a little bit ."
[15:54] fe068 | And besi and I think you mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad
[15:55] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[15:58] fe068 | of time anyway .
[16:01] fe068 | Yeah .
[16:02] fe069 | Then to have it be cut off .
[16:02] me070 | Yeah .
"[16:02] fe068 | Don't have it just start , yeah ."
"[16:04] me070 | I always wonder about the , um , time bins . I mean , I usually ended adjusting them a little bit I mean ,"
"[16:04] fe068 | Um , so ."
[16:06] fe008 | Yeah .
[16:09] me070 | definitely when something 's cut off at the beginning or the end but also sometimes there 's just like
"[16:13] me070 | huge pads of , you know ,"
"[16:16] me070 | air before and or after , um , that I don't really feel"
[16:18] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:21] me070 | is necessary for that segment , and I usually , um , you know ,"
[16:23] fe067 | Hmm .
"[16:24] fe069 | Shrink in them or whatever , yeah ."
[16:24] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[16:25] fe008 | Nice .
[16:26] fe067 | Seems like I always have to cut off pads at the end .
[16:27] fe008 | Nice .
"[16:29] fe067 | I don't have so much problem at the beginning , but ."
[16:30] fe069 | Of breath or of uh nothing ?
"[16:32] fe067 | No , of n just nothing . Yeah ."
"[16:32] me070 | Just nothing , yeah ."
"[16:33] fe069 | Hmm , yeah ."
"[16:33] fe068 | Yeah , there 's nothing going on ."
[16:34] fe069 | Yeah .
[16:38] fe069 | Yeah .
[16:38] fe069 | With fricatives a lot .
[16:40] fe067 | Mmm .
[16:45] fe066 | so much because you 've got the pre - voicing before the consonant actually begins .
"[16:48] fe069 | Although I found one in actually I was just working right before this meeting , one where someone said , "" great "" and"
[16:57] fe069 | the G it was pronounced as a K so it was unvoiced and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning .
[17:00] fe066 | Oh .
[17:02] fe069 | And then
"[17:04] fe069 | you It sounded like "" great "" if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like "" great "" ."
[17:07] me070 | Uh - huh .
[17:10] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[17:14] fe069 | I don't know . Usually it 's not usually that doesn't happen but this time it did .
[17:15] fe066 | That 's kind of interesting .
"[17:19] fe068 | So for the non - linguists , what 's a fricative ?"
[17:26] me070 | Yeah .
"[17:26] fe068 | Oh , OK ."
[17:37] fe069 | But it 's not completely blocking the airflow .
"[17:38] fe068 | Oh , I see ."
"[17:38] me070 | Yeah , and you can sort of you can sort of keep it going a little bit ."
[17:39] fe066 | Right .
"[17:39] fe068 | Oh , I see ."
"[17:41] fe068 | Oh , OK ."
"[17:41] fe067 | Unlike like a "" tuh "" or a "" kuh "" that just stops ."
[17:41] fe069 | Yeah .
[17:44] fe069 | Yeah .
[17:44] fe068 | Right .
[17:45] fe068 | Got it .
"[17:49] fe008 | Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid , so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this , yeah ."
[17:51] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[17:52] fe068 | Oh , right , yeah , oh you Yeah ."
"[17:54] fe008 | So , um , in did you have you run into places I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin . Have you had that happen ?"
"[18:01] fe069 | Mmm , yeah ."
"[18:01] me070 | Oh , yeah ."
[18:02] fe066 | Yeah .
[18:02] fe008 | That 's fascinating .
[18:03] fe066 | Yeah .
"[18:03] fe008 | Oh , it 's really a kick ."
[18:04] fe068 | Yeah .
"[18:05] fe066 | And it sometimes changes the entire utterance , too ."
[18:07] fe069 | Oh it does . Completely .
[18:08] me070 | Yeah .
[18:08] fe008 | Yeah .
"[18:09] fe069 | Yeah , I I don't remember the words exactly . It 's a shame . There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle ,"
[18:14] fe069 | and there was a little
[18:15] fe069 | like
[18:16] fe069 | millisecond of break in the middle .
[18:18] fe069 | And
"[18:19] fe069 | if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it . It was written as something else , and then"
[18:25] fe069 | it became a
[18:26] fe069 | word together from what was before and after and then with this little tiny
"[18:31] fe069 | So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk"
[18:34] fe069 | in between
[18:36] fe069 | different
[18:40] fe068 | Hmm .
[18:40] fe066 | We stop voicing sometimes .
"[18:41] fe069 | Yeah , or something like that ."
[18:44] fe069 | It 's probably like inaudible
[18:48] fe069 | And maybe the pause was just so short that
[18:50] fe069 | it made up a
[18:57] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[18:59] fe008 | i it 's h
"[18:59] fe069 | On purpose , though ."
[19:01] fe069 | Or not .
"[19:03] fe008 | it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose , but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style ,"
[19:10] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[19:14] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:17] fe008 | It 's not a great example , but you know ?"
[19:19] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[19:21] fe008 | Yeah .
"[19:23] fe008 | it 's funny how , um ,"
"[19:26] fe008 | i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes and I 've run across that also ."
[19:31] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[19:31] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[19:32] fe068 | Yeah .
"[19:34] fe069 | Yeah , that is true ."
"[19:36] me070 | Hmm . Would you want , um ,"
"[19:38] me070 | uh ,"
"[19:39] me070 | a transcription of something like that , of a big pause in between in the middle of a word ? Or just leave it as , "" fascinating "" ?"
"[19:46] fe008 | What I 've done I 've It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it ."
[19:48] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:52] fe008 | you know , fin I haven't looked at everything . I 've looked at I 've probably"
"[19:56] fe008 | looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data ,"
"[19:59] fe008 | you know , all the way through e every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far ."
"[20:03] fe008 | And , um ,"
[20:12] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:13] fe008 | it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um ,"
[20:15] me070 | Mmm .
[20:17] fe008 | of of
[20:18] fe008 | pre precision that
[20:23] fe008 | and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project .
"[20:31] fe008 | But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation ."
[20:39] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:39] fe008 | So just do a you know , a mark , then "" fascinating "" , and then put "" PRN "" and uh "" interrupted by a pause "" or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know ."
"[20:40] fe066 | Mm - hmm , mm - hmm ."
[20:43] fe066 | PRN .
[20:44] fe069 | How it was really pronounced ?
[20:44] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[20:46] me070 | Right .
"[20:47] fe068 | Mmm , oh right ."
[20:48] fe068 | Uh - huh .
"[20:49] fe008 | You know , "" P R dot dot fascinating "" , whatever it is ."
[20:49] fe069 | I always get confused with the
[20:51] fe069 | pronunciation
[20:52] fe069 | convention .
"[20:53] fe008 | Sorry , what was this ?"
[20:55] fe008 | OK .
[20:59] fe069 | Because I think w
[21:00] fe069 | m may di in the beginning did we do
[21:03] fe069 | the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ? And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets
[21:10] fe069 | what it sounded like ?
[21:11] fe068 | Right .
"[21:12] fe069 | We did a switch , right ?"
[21:13] fe069 | Or not . I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi
"[21:14] fe068 | Mm - hmm , I it it never occurred to me , but now that you 're mentioning it , n yeah , yeah , possibly ."
"[21:19] fe008 | There was an adjustment , and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that"
[21:22] fe069 | OK . So the convention as it stands now is
[21:25] fe069 | write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little
[21:28] fe008 | Yeah .
[21:30] fe008 | Yep .
"[21:31] fe069 | apostrophe , or whatever you call it ,"
"[21:31] fe008 | Mm - hmm , that 's right ."
[21:32] fe069 | and then
"[21:33] fe069 | "" PRN "" ,"
"[21:33] fe008 | And then in the brackets , what it Uh - huh . So i you know , "" OK "" is a very"
[21:34] fe069 | how it 's pronounced .
"[21:36] fe008 | e easy example . A person says , "" Mm - kay "" then ,"
[21:37] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[21:39] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[21:39] fe067 | Oh .
"[21:39] fe008 | it 's "" OK "" with a ha a little hatch and then ,"
"[21:42] fe008 | "" PRN "" and then "" m mm - kay "" , or whatever it is in quotes ."
"[21:44] fe068 | Oh , right ."
[21:44] fe069 | OK .
[21:45] fe066 | Oh . Right .
"[21:45] fe068 | I think Nelson 's the only one who , uh Oh , Morgan ."
[21:49] fe068 | You guys call him Morgan .
"[21:50] fe008 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[21:51] fe068 | He 's the only one who ever did that , I think . "" Mm - kay . """
[21:54] fe068 | He does it a yeah .
[21:54] fe066 | OK .
"[21:55] me070 | Yeah , and some people just say , "" Kay . """
[21:57] fe069 | Yeah .
"[21:57] fe068 | "" Kay "" , yeah , that 's true ."
"[21:57] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
[21:58] me070 | S
[21:58] fe066 | Yeah .
"[21:59] fe008 | And of course , you know I mean , there 's also this other reduction that"
"[22:03] fe008 | w that we 've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says "" and "" versus "" nnn "" versus , you know , "" nd "" , whatever all the different ways of reducing "" and "" ."
[22:09] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[22:12] fe068 | That 's true .
[22:12] fe008 | Because you can assume that
"[22:14] fe008 | the speech recognition ,"
"[22:15] fe008 | um ,"
"[22:16] fe008 | uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types , and the same thing for ,"
[22:25] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[22:26] me070 | Uh - huh .
[22:28] fe008 | Exactly .
[22:29] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[22:29] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:29] fe008 | And that they should be able to handle themselves , and and that we assume also that"
"[22:33] fe008 | for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now , and"
"[22:38] fe008 | those distinctions could be added later if needed but it 's unlikely that they would be . And it 's so time - consuming . So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that , and so then you begin to think , "" Well what about "" OK "" ? I mean , maybe"
[22:42] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[22:54] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[22:54] fe067 | Mmm .
"[22:59] fe008 | you know , it 's th this is a case where ,"
"[23:01] fe008 | um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things but I I sort of figure that"
[23:05] fe008 | that that 's
[23:09] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[23:11] fe069 | Mmm .
"[23:12] fe008 | but I don't change it back if it 's there , you know ."
[23:12] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[23:13] fe066 | I think with like some of them like
[23:18] fe008 | Yes .
"[23:19] fe066 | you can distinguished very , uh , u"
[23:22] fe066 | dif definitively like what context they 're gonna be used in .
[23:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[23:27] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:27] fe066 | Like um , like you would say "" the apple "" because it 's "" the "" plus then the next word starts with a vowel ."
[23:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[23:33] fe069 | Yeah .
"[23:34] fe069 | There 's a study done on when people say "" uh "" and when people say "" um "" ."
"[23:37] fe069 | Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation ,"
[23:41] fe067 | Hmm .
[23:42] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[23:45] fe069 | It 's really interesting .
[23:46] fe066 | But something like Yeah .
"[23:46] me070 | and I couldn't get anything . I kept looking at all the "" uh 's "" and "" um 's "" and I was like , "" Oh , this would be hard to do . """
"[23:49] fe008 | Mm - hmm , interesting ."
[23:54] fe069 | Yeah .
"[23:54] fe008 | Oh , that 's interesting . Huh ."
"[23:55] fe069 | You know , what 's On that"
"[23:56] fe069 | sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is"
[24:04] fe008 | Yeah .
"[24:05] fe069 | And then you can have "" uh "" like"
"[24:06] fe069 | a pause or whatever as "" uh "" , and sometimes it 's hard to tell"
[24:07] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:10] fe069 | what the person meant . Are did they mean "" uh "" like they 're pausing or did they mean "" a "" like "" a"
"[24:11] fe066 | Mmm , yeah ."
[24:14] fe066 | Yeah .
[24:15] fe008 | Yeah .
[24:15] fe066 | I 've run into that .
[24:15] me070 | Really ?
[24:16] fe008 | Yeah .
[24:16] fe066 | Yeah .
[24:16] fe069 | Yeah .
[24:17] fe068 | Right .
[24:17] fe067 | Hmm .
[24:17] fe008 | Once in a while .
[24:17] fe069 | And
[24:18] me070 | I don't usually get con
"[24:18] fe069 | you can kind of tell from the context but sometimes it 's hard , yeah ."
[24:20] fe008 | Yes .
[24:20] me070 | Right .
"[24:21] fe068 | Yeah , that came up a couple of times , yeah ."
[24:22] fe069 | Yeah .
[24:22] me070 | Huh .
"[24:22] fe008 | I agree . And and when I when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin ,"
[24:28] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[24:28] me070 | Uh - huh .
[24:29] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:29] fe008 | I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense , give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it ."
[24:34] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[24:34] me070 | Uh - huh .
[24:35] fe066 | Sometimes I 'll put in like a bracket like
"[24:38] fe066 | uh , you know , the orthographic A slash UH"
[24:42] fe066 | like if I 'm really confused .
"[24:43] fe069 | Like you can't tell , mm - hmm ."
[24:43] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[24:46] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:46] fe008 | It must be really rare though , I haven't run across that often ."
[24:49] fe008 | Ha - ha h Is it rare ?
[24:49] fe066 | A few times .
"[24:50] fe069 | A few . It 's really yeah , relatively rare ."
[24:51] fe008 | OK .
[24:52] fe067 | I don't think I ever have .
[24:52] fe069 | Yeah .
[24:54] fe069 | Yeah . I mean I can only think of
[24:56] fe069 | like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while .
[25:00] me070 | Hmm .
[25:01] fe069 | Other times just
[25:03] fe069 | you look at it and what 's the context .
[25:05] fe069 | Yeah .
"[25:07] fe069 | It 's OK , I don't know ."
[25:08] fe066 | Right .
"[25:09] fe008 | OK . Well , le let 's see now , there 's another another methodo what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds ,"
[25:17] fe068 | Huh .
"[25:17] fe008 | something like , um ,"
"[25:19] fe008 | you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things ."
[25:26] me070 | Right .
"[25:26] fe008 | What kind of , uh , hypotheses have has this caused you uh , I mean , don't wanna"
"[25:30] fe008 | have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore , but ,"
"[25:34] fe008 | you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data . That kinda thing , maybe ,"
[25:42] fe068 | Hnh .
[25:47] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:50] fe008 | uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later or I don't know I mean , could do anything"
[25:55] fe066 | This is fine .
[25:55] fe069 | This time is fine for me .
"[25:56] me070 | Yeah , this is a good time for me ."
[25:57] fe008 | Good time for you ?
[25:58] fe068 | It should be .
[25:59] fe008 | OK .
"[26:00] fe068 | Um , I know I have something in the morning , which I don't normally have ."
"[26:06] fe068 | Um , I 'll let you know if it 's it 'll be a problem but it should be OK ."
[26:10] fe008 | OK .
[26:10] fe068 | Two - thirty should be late enough . So .
[26:11] fe008 | OK .
[26:13] fe066 | In m
[26:21] fe008 | Wow . You did really well . Yeah .
[26:25] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:25] fe008 | Oh , did you ? OK , OK ."
"[26:29] fe066 | I you know , I 'm gonna gonna be hobbling a little slowly ."
[26:32] fe069 | Then you don't have to rush .
[26:32] fe008 | Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ?
[26:36] fe068 | No .
[26:36] me070 | No .
[26:37] fe008 | OK .
[26:39] fe066 | No .
[26:39] fe068 | Except we 'll miss treat time .
[26:42] fe066 | Tea !
"[26:49] fe068 | like a half hour , then take a little break , then come back and finish the meet"
[26:54] fe069 | You know what we could do ?
[26:58] fe069 | someone like the front desk person or Lila to like set aside a little bit for us .
[27:03] fe068 | Little bit of treats .
"[27:03] fe008 | Hey , they would ."
[27:03] fe066 | Oh that 's true .
[27:04] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:04] fe008 | Yeah , they would . That 's that 's not a bad solution ."
[27:04] me070 | Yeah .
[27:06] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:07] fe068 | It 's not gonna be birthday cake , so ."
"[27:09] fe069 | Yeah , so we 'll survive ."
[27:10] fe068 | Yeah .
"[27:17] fe008 | OK , so um Oh ,"
"[27:18] fe008 | uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ? I mean , if we h had those things an hour later like , would people OK ?"
[27:23] fe066 | This is fine with me .
[27:24] fe069 | That 's fine too .
[27:24] fe068 | Yeah .
"[27:24] fe008 | OK , good . Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that . OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation ."
[27:25] fe067 | Hmm .
[27:25] me070 | Yeah . That 's fine .
[27:25] fe069 | Yeah .
"[27:36] fe008 | Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint ."
"[27:39] fe008 | Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach . So ,"
"[27:42] fe008 | uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you"
[27:48] fe008 | correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves .
[27:56] me070 | I don't think I have ever
[27:57] fe008 | has there already been t
[28:00] fe066 | I have .
[28:01] me070 | I th I feel like they 've all been done probably by
[28:05] fe066 | You talking about the IBM ones ?
"[28:07] fe008 | Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF , that 's the Tigerfish ."
[28:09] fe068 | Right .
[28:09] me070 | T
"[28:10] fe066 | Right , yeah , oh , yeah yeah ."
"[28:11] me070 | Oh , m yeah , then I guess I have . Maybe the o one I 'm working on now ."
[28:15] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[28:15] fe008 | So d
"[28:15] me070 | They have different definitely a different style , right ?"
"[28:18] me070 | Do they end all them all in dots , like dot dot ?"
[28:18] fe066 | Yeah .
[28:20] fe008 | There 's a lot of that . Yeah .
"[28:21] fe069 | Yeah , mm - hmm ."
[28:21] fe067 | They used to .
[28:21] fe066 | I really th
[28:27] fe069 | Punctuation after brackets .
"[28:29] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right too ."
[28:29] fe066 | Yep .
"[28:30] me070 | Oh , OK , yeah , then I 'm doing that right now ."
[28:30] fe068 | Right .
"[28:32] fe068 | Oh , right , "" Laugh , period "" ."
[28:32] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[28:32] fe069 | Yeah .
"[28:34] fe068 | Something like that , right ?"
[28:34] fe066 | Right .
[28:36] fe069 | No it doesn't to me either but .
[28:36] fe008 | Yeah .
"[28:38] fe008 | Exactly . Exactly , I 'm glad you Yeah , exactly ."
[28:40] fe068 | Yeah .
[28:42] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:42] fe066 | if I could be completely frank , I really didn't like the IBM ones ."
[28:43] fe008 | Yeah .
"[28:46] fe008 | Oh , good to know ."
[28:47] fe069 | I didn't either .
"[28:47] fe008 | Oh , that 's helpful ."
[28:50] fe066 | I just I I ended up basically redoing them .
[28:52] fe008 | OK .
[28:53] fe067 | Hmm .
"[28:53] fe066 | Um , like from start to finish , so when I was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself ."
[29:01] fe008 | Wow . Wow !
[29:01] fe068 | Hmm .
[29:01] me070 | Hmm .
"[29:02] fe008 | Wow , OK ."
[29:03] me070 | Yeah .
[29:07] fe069 | there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tigerfish ones .
[29:10] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:11] fe066 | Yeah , Tigerfish are better ."
[29:12] fe069 | Yeah .
"[29:13] fe069 | And they just have better intuitions , or I don't know what but , about what 's said ."
[29:15] me070 | OK -
[29:16] me070 | Which are What are the two differences ? I 'm not sure .
[29:18] fe008 | I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one . So this was earlier on .
[29:21] me070 | So do I have a Tigerfish one right now ?
[29:21] fe067 | Hmm .
"[29:22] fe069 | If it says "" TF "" ."
"[29:22] fe066 | If it says "" TF "" ."
[29:22] fe008 | You probably do .
[29:24] me070 | Uh - huh .
[29:25] me070 | OK .
"[29:26] fe066 | Yeah . The ones that say "" IBM "" are like They actually say "" IBM "" ."
"[29:28] me070 | The IBM ones were the ones that came in huge , huge paragraphs , huh ?"
"[29:31] fe066 | Yes ! Yeah , and you have to parse them all down . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[29:31] me070 | See , I never got one of those ."
"[29:35] fe008 | So you didn't get one ? Oh , interesting ."
[29:36] fe066 | OK .
[29:36] fe067 | I didn't get one either .
"[29:37] fe068 | I think those show up in Tigerfish too , cuz I think I 've had a couple of Tigerfish where I 've had to break them up ."
[29:39] fe069 | Where they have li
[29:39] me070 | Ye -
"[29:42] fe069 | they 're not huge huge , though ."
[29:43] fe068 | A couple were . Yeah . And I had to sorta break them down .
[29:44] fe069 | Really ?
[29:46] fe069 | Oh .
[29:47] fe069 | I don't know .
[29:52] fe008 | No .
[29:53] me070 | Yeah .
[29:57] me070 | Yeah .
[29:58] me070 | They just have They just have it segmented . You can tell because
[29:58] fe008 | Yeah .
[30:08] fe066 | Right .
[30:09] fe069 | Yeah .
[30:10] fe068 | Right .
[30:10] fe008 | There 's also some i iffiness about
[30:10] fe066 | Als -
[30:17] me070 | Mmm .
"[30:21] fe008 | well , within a single turn ,"
[30:23] fe008 | l it 'll be spelled in three different ways .
[30:26] fe066 | Huh .
[30:28] me070 | Uh - huh .
[30:30] fe068 | Right .
[30:30] me070 | Right .
[30:32] me070 | Yeah .
"[30:34] fe066 | Oh , that 's interesting ."
"[30:34] fe008 | But , who knows ?"
"[30:34] fe069 | And they don't One person doesn't listen to all the channels of one meeting , right ?"
"[30:40] fe008 | Well , you know , the The way they 're listening to it is"
[30:41] fe069 | Or can they ? I don't know . Mm - hmm .
[30:44] fe008 | they get a they get It 's linearized . So
"[30:47] fe008 | if you picture what we have on the screen ,"
[30:56] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:59] fe008 | And so what they would get is this block from the first guy , this block from the second guy , and then the top of the overlap and then the second guy in the overlap ."
[31:06] fe069 | Oh .
"[31:06] me070 | Oh , wow ."
[31:07] fe068 | Hmm .
[31:07] fe067 | Hmm .
[31:12] me070 | So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did ?
"[31:14] fe069 | Oh , OK ."
"[31:16] fe008 | Um , let 's see , they hear them Oh !"
"[31:18] fe008 | uh , they hear them separately in two chunks , but then sometimes"
"[31:23] fe008 | they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is ."
[31:27] fe069 | Uh - huh .
[31:34] fe008 | So what they get is they get a beep
[31:36] fe008 | that tells them when there 's something that they think that the
[31:39] fe008 | f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there .
[31:42] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[31:42] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[31:42] fe067 | Mmm .
[31:49] fe069 | As there are slots in the pre - segmentation . Mm - hmm .
"[31:50] fe008 | Exactly . Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered ,"
"[31:52] fe008 | we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed , and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together because when it comes back to our end ,"
[31:56] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[31:57] me070 | Hmm .
"[31:59] fe008 | um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've"
"[32:02] fe008 | uh , partitioned according to the"
[32:04] fe008 | tape that they were given .
[32:05] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[32:06] fe008 | Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either so it 's it 's audiotape .
[32:10] fe067 | Oh wow .
"[32:10] fe069 | Oh , wow ."
[32:10] fe068 | Huh .
[32:10] fe066 | Oh .
"[32:10] me070 | Hmm , wow ."
"[32:11] fe008 | And they type it on and then then it comes back to us and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format and then we can use it . But ,"
[32:11] fe068 | Makes it really hard .
[32:12] me070 | Wow .
[32:19] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:21] fe008 | um , there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance and that 's because"
"[32:27] fe008 | that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two , and you 'll have like two totally parallel"
[32:30] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[32:31] fe069 | Yeah .
[32:33] fe008 | r renditions of the same thing .
[32:35] fe008 | Because
[32:35] fe068 | Right .
"[32:35] fe008 | i it 's just i n So what they get is like i t is they get something like "" beep one "" ."
"[32:41] fe008 | And then then they get "" beep two "" , "" beep three "" . Chuck Wooters does the numbers ."
"[32:45] fe008 | And , um , it cycles through ."
[32:45] fe068 | Wow .
"[32:46] fe068 | Oh , so they don't Do they know the names of the speakers ?"
[32:49] fe008 | No .
"[32:50] fe068 | Oh , OK ."
[32:50] fe008 | And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together .
[32:51] fe068 | Cuz y OK .
[32:53] fe068 | Cuz sometimes there 'd just be interesting things where
[32:59] fe068 | like
"[33:00] fe068 | Morgan would be speaking but it 'd be on your channel , and it 'd be like , "" This is clearly not a woman speaking . """
"[33:02] fe008 | Yes , exactly ."
[33:03] me070 | Hmm .
"[33:06] fe068 | It 's like , "" How could they do that ? "" It 's like Well now it 's it m seems more reasonable that they 'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea ."
[33:07] fe008 | And that 's why .
[33:08] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[33:09] fe008 | Exactly right .
[33:11] fe066 | OK .
[33:11] fe069 | Yeah .
[33:13] fe067 | Mmm .
"[33:13] fe069 | God , it must take them a really long time to do these ."
[33:13] me070 | Hmm .
[33:13] fe008 | Yeah .
[33:13] fe068 | Um .
[33:16] fe008 | They 're very fast . Is l
[33:17] fe069 | That 's amazing . It sounds so hard .
[33:17] fe008 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[33:19] fe008 | It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used , and"
[33:24] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:24] fe008 | we don't know exactly how they do it and I think that that 's by intention , that @ @ not just me who thinks that it 's that"
[33:27] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:29] fe008 | proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business and they probably don't wanna ,"
[33:32] fe067 | Mmm .
[33:33] me070 | Huh .
[33:33] fe066 | Right .
"[33:33] fe008 | uh ,"
[33:33] fe069 | Leak their secrets ?
[33:34] fe008 | say too much about it . Yeah . Yeah .
[33:48] fe008 | Huh .
[33:48] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[33:49] fe067 | Mmm .
[33:49] fe069 | but
[33:50] fe069 | it took a really long time and I 'd get frustrated with it .
[33:53] fe066 | Yeah .
"[33:56] fe069 | I don't know , I would"
"[33:57] fe069 | not be as thorough , not be as careful ."
[33:59] me070 | I kinda miss it .
[33:59] fe008 | Excellent . Uh - huh .
"[34:00] me070 | I liked Yeah , I liked transcribing ."
"[34:00] fe008 | You miss Oh ! I see . Oh , interesting ."
[34:01] fe067 | I kinda did too .
"[34:01] fe068 | Yeah , I liked transcribing ."
[34:03] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[34:07] fe069 | It was more personal . Yeah .
[34:14] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:15] fe008 | Oh , how interesting . Yeah ."
[34:17] fe069 | Yeah .
[34:18] me070 | It 's still cool .
"[34:19] me070 | But , um , yeah , I did I did like actually doing the transcribing"
"[34:22] fe069 | You don't tend to notice as much I don't think at checking as you do transcribing , because it 's already there so you don't have to pay as much attention ."
[34:22] me070 | a little bit more .
[34:27] fe066 | That 's true .
[34:27] me070 | Yeah .
"[34:28] fe008 | Yeah , OK ."
[34:28] fe067 | Mmm .
"[34:30] me070 | when you 're , um , just checking you 're You 're usually just looking for certain things that you know are gonna come up , and"
"[34:35] me070 | I usually assume that , um , the words are mostly right , although I g you know , I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right , but usually it 's like , punctuation and capitalization and"
"[34:44] me070 | other things that I 'm end up changing . And time bins , yeah ."
"[34:45] fe069 | And time bin corrections and things , yeah ."
[34:49] fe069 | Yeah .
[34:49] fe066 | I guess I 'm such a perfectionist that I sort of combine
"[34:52] fe066 | the two when I 'm checking , like I act as though I 'm transcribing it ."
[34:56] fe069 | Mmm .
[34:57] me070 | Really ?
[35:04] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:10] fe066 | I think I really , like ,"
[35:11] fe066 | think of it in terms of
[35:13] fe066 | re - transcribing it almost
[35:15] me070 | Yeah .
[35:15] fe067 | Hmm .
"[35:16] fe066 | You know , b So ,"
"[35:18] fe066 | like , I I change time bins a lot , and I"
[35:20] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[35:20] me070 | Right .
[35:26] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:28] fe066 | So , I guess I don't see"
[35:31] fe066 | too much of a difference but that 's just because it 's me . Like I think I like checking more for that reason because
[35:34] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[35:37] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:40] fe066 | it 's like it 's a it 's a little helpful . It 's like kind of , you know , somebody 's helping me a little bit , but I 'm actually doing the work anyway ,"
[35:44] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[35:46] me070 | Right .
[35:46] fe066 | is kind of how I see it .
[35:47] fe069 | Hmm .
[35:48] fe067 | Hmm .
[35:48] me070 | Hmm .
[35:49] fe069 | One thing that 's annoying I think with checking is that
[35:49] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[35:52] fe069 | a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it 's their turn to give their little report or whatever .
[35:59] fe067 | Mmm .
[36:00] fe069 | And
[36:02] fe069 | yet
[36:03] fe069 | you have to check
[36:04] fe069 | the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to
[36:08] fe069 | encode that weren't on the pre - segmenter . But
[36:12] fe069 | sometimes it 's not visually easy .
[36:15] me070 | Yeah .
[36:16] fe069 | And so
[36:24] fe069 | or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually . It 's hard to decide sometimes .
[36:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:28] fe008 | And this is when you crank up the visual . I mean , you 've still got the maximum Yeah . OK ."
[36:29] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[36:30] fe069 | Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . And s
"[36:31] me070 | Yeah . Well , sometimes when you crank up the visual all it gives you is the background speakers ."
[36:31] fe066 | Yeah .
[36:35] fe067 | Yeah .
[36:36] fe066 | Yeah .
[36:37] fe067 | Or if they 're breathing loudly .
[36:38] me070 | So .
[36:38] fe008 | Yeah .
[36:38] me070 | Yeah .
[36:39] fe069 | Yeah .
"[36:39] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
"[36:40] fe008 | Well , i it 's a judgment call . And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that"
[36:41] fe069 | Yeah .
"[36:47] fe008 | they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , "" Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . """
[36:52] me070 | Yeah . The I mean but also if they have it all
"[36:55] me070 | pre - segmented and they can only hear the segments , they often miss what 's in between because they didn't even have the option of listening to what 's in between ."
[37:01] fe069 | You mean the
[37:02] fe066 | Right .
[37:02] fe069 | transcribers ? Yeah .
[37:03] fe067 | Yeah .
"[37:04] fe008 | Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right ."
"[37:08] fe008 | Yeah , that 's right ."
[37:08] fe069 | And even bigger things .
"[37:10] fe069 | I mean you 've said things that weren't caught on the pre - segmenter , like"
"[37:14] fe069 | whispers , kind of ."
[37:15] fe066 | Yeah .
[37:15] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:15] fe069 | Just like ,"
"[37:16] fe069 | "" Oh , that 's interesting "" , or something like that ."
"[37:18] fe066 | Well , like little sighs , or like inbreaths , like as though you 're gonna start speaking , which I feel is important"
"[37:21] fe069 | Yeah , you 're about to s speak ."
"[37:24] fe008 | Yes , I agree ."
[37:25] fe067 | Hmm .
[37:25] fe066 | because it means that somebody 's about to interject something but then they decide for whatever reason that they 're not going to .
[37:30] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[37:30] fe069 | Yeah .
"[37:31] fe066 | And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things , those kind of vo vocal cues ."
[37:36] fe069 | And sometimes even laughs .
"[37:38] fe066 | Yeah , breath - laughs especially ."
[37:38] me070 | Yeah .
[37:39] fe069 | Uh - huh . Uh - huh .
[37:40] me070 | Hmm .
[37:45] me070 | I usually don't transcribe the the inbreaths or things like that .
"[37:47] fe069 | I don't either . M but , I mean I don't take them out if they 're already there ."
[37:50] me070 | You know ?
"[37:51] fe068 | If it sounds like a yawn . I 've transcribed yawns ,"
[37:54] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[37:54] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:55] fe068 | You can hear , there 's like . You know , it , like something like that ."
[37:58] fe069 | Yeah .
[38:00] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:00] fe008 | It Well , it 's communicative . Yeah ."
[38:01] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:01] fe068 | Yeah , or when it 's a laugh . I mean , often in the Tigerfish there 'd it would si say "" breath "" ,"
[38:02] me070 | Yeah .
[38:06] fe068 | but it it w it actually seemed more like a laugh .
[38:06] fe008 | Yeah .
[38:06] fe067 | It 's really a laugh .
"[38:06] me070 | It 's a laugh , yeah ."
[38:07] fe069 | But it 's a laugh .
[38:07] fe066 | It 's actually a breath - laugh .
"[38:08] fe068 | Um , cuz everyone 's laughing . @ @ Someone has just said something funny and everyone 's like , "" Ah - ha - ha - ha - ha "" . Yeah ."
[38:10] me070 | Uh - huh .
[38:13] fe066 | Right .
"[38:16] fe068 | Right , it 's it 's not a very committed laugh , but it 's still a laugh ."
"[38:18] fe069 | I don't know how you do it , you know ?"
[38:26] fe068 | but yeah .
"[38:27] fe008 | Have you noticed that Tiger - I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses "" cough "" a lot where it isn't really a cough . You notice that ? Yeah ."
[38:32] me070 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[38:33] fe066 | Oh , yeah ."
[38:33] fe067 | Mmm .
"[38:34] fe068 | Yeah , I I just fix that ."
[38:34] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[38:35] me070 | I 'd fix that too .
"[38:36] fe008 | Yeah . Do you find you 've i This has caused me to wonder . So , in Tigerfish ones ,"
[38:47] fe008 | u you probably do add things in those places where
[38:50] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:52] fe008 | where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it ."
[38:56] fe069 | You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe ?
[38:58] fe008 | Yeah .
[38:58] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:00] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[39:00] fe008 | Interesting .

[39:01] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:03] fe069 | Yeah .
[39:04] me070 | Huh .
[39:05] fe008 | Huh .
[39:13] fe068 | Mmm .
[39:14] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:18] fe069 | I remember transcribing one person , all they did was clear their throat and breathe ."
[39:31] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[39:32] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:34] fe069 | But then there are some people who are Even if they 're not actually speaking ,"
[39:34] fe008 | Yeah .
[39:38] fe069 | you can tell they 're more
"[39:40] fe069 | involved or interested or something , cuz they 're always , "" Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm "" Um , reacting . Yeah ."
[39:42] fe066 | Reacting .
[39:43] me070 | Uh - huh .
[39:43] fe066 | Yeah .
"[39:45] fe008 | It just occurred to me , this is a a different kind of question , but"
"[39:49] fe008 | from having listened to all these people ,"
[39:56] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:56] fe008 | You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances ."
[39:56] fe067 | Mmm .
[39:58] me070 | Uh - huh .
"[39:59] fe008 | I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do . And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are and , "" Oh , you were so funny in that meeting "" and it it has this sort of"
[40:03] fe066 | Yeah .
"[40:08] fe008 | unusual dynamic because , you know , I I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be , except of course they they agreed , they signed , they were there , they agreed ."
[40:10] fe067 | Mmm .
[40:13] fe069 | Yeah .

"[40:15] fe069 | Right , yeah ."
[40:15] fe067 | Mmm .
"[40:16] fe008 | But but it but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say ,"
"[40:20] fe008 | you know , i i you know , if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have"
"[40:29] fe069 | I remember from the very beginning , I"
[40:31] fe069 | would go to tea and start recognizing voices .
"[40:34] fe008 | Oh , that 'd be interesting ."
"[40:34] fe069 | And like turn around and be like ,"
[40:34] fe068 | Yeah .
[40:34] fe066 | Yep .
"[40:36] fe069 | "" Wait ,"

[41:20] fe008 | Yeah .
[41:21] fe069 | She always tends to get interrupted .

[41:30] fe008 | it th there 's this
[41:36] fe066 | Yes .
[41:43] me070 | Yeah .
"[41:51] fe008 | It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things ."
[41:54] fe069 | It 's really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe because
"[42:04] fe069 | And then you can It 's really nice to have a little bit of humor , a little bit of"
[42:08] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:08] fe069 | break away from that because it 's hard to sit there and li see like ,"

[42:28] fe069 | Yeah .
[42:29] fe067 | Mmm .
[42:32] fe067 | Mmm .

[42:42] fe066 | Yeah .
[42:43] me070 | Yeah .

"[42:43] fe066 | Some of that computer stuff , I just Oh , my God ."
[42:50] fe069 | Yeah .
"[42:51] fe066 | Yeah , I just I start zoning out sometimes . Like , I don't mean to , but I 'm just kind of going , "" I don't know what any of these acronyms are and no idea what you 're talking about . """
[42:56] fe069 | Yeah .
"[42:58] fe069 | And there was a whole set of meetings that are like that . It Wasn't there ? Yeah , those were really hard ."
[43:00] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[43:00] fe008 | That 's right .
[43:00] fe066 | Yeah .
"[43:02] me070 | Oh , yeah ."
"[43:03] fe066 | And they 're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see , and so we don't know what they 're referring to , and so ."
[43:03] fe069 | Really hard .
"[43:11] fe068 | something 's going on that I don't know . """
"[43:13] fe066 | Yeah , they 're referring to this or that and the other thing and you 're just going , "" No , I don't understand . """
[43:16] fe069 | Yeah .
[43:17] fe069 | U no .
"[43:18] fe008 | Yeah , it 's difficult ."
"[43:18] fe068 | Yeah , you guys talked about doing a videotape ."
[43:22] fe068 | The -
"[43:24] fe008 | two things . First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone , that it would be worthwhile doing ."
[43:30] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:31] fe008 | And that 's the other thing , that we don't have"
[43:32] fe008 | someone currently doing the video thing . It would really be interesting .
[43:35] fe068 | Yeah . Cuz I know it was mentioned .
[43:36] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[43:37] fe068 | Also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds .
"[43:41] fe068 | Li - it was Liz 's idea , wasn't it ?"
[43:43] fe068 | Yeah .
[43:43] fe069 | What would be the point of that ?
"[43:45] fe008 | Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to"
[43:47] fe069 | Oh .
[43:48] fe008 | give feedback .
"[43:49] me070 | Oh , wow ."
[43:50] fe069 | I think that would be really interesting .
[43:50] fe066 | Oh I see . So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually ? Like you can't use gesture ?
[43:51] me070 | That would be interesting .
[43:54] fe008 | Yeah .
[43:55] fe008 | Exactly .
[43:55] fe066 | Ah .
[43:55] fe008 | Yeah .
[43:59] fe008 | you know the m the th y y
[44:06] fe069 | Right .
[44:06] me070 | Mmm .
[44:07] fe066 | Right .
[44:10] fe008 | that you wouldn't normally have .
[44:19] fe069 | That 'd be kinda creepy .
"[44:19] fe008 | But then , someone else said no , cuz there are these m special lights that have to stay on all the time"
[44:24] fe066 | Oh .
[44:24] fe008 | for the fire code or whatever it is .
"[44:25] me070 | Oh , wow ."
[44:26] fe068 | I would just be so worried that someone would cheat .
[44:39] fe066 | Totally .
[44:56] fe008 | they 've had some good results in terms of the digits which
[45:00] fe008 | they do in terms of having a r a nice
"[45:03] fe008 | broad set of speakers doing the same thing , meeting after meeting after meeting ."
[45:06] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[45:06] fe067 | Hmm .
[45:08] fe069 | That 's good .
[45:15] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[45:16] fe008 | if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea ?
[45:18] fe066 | Yeah .
[45:18] fe069 | That 's OK .
[45:18] fe008 | And then continue with this this next next week ?
"[45:19] fe068 | Yeah , sure ."
[45:19] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[45:20] me070 | OK .
"[45:21] fe068 | Oh , yeah ."
[45:21] fe069 | It 's OK .
[45:21] fe008 | That 'd be great .
"[45:22] fe008 | OK , so , um , let 's see ."
[45:26] fe008 | Yes .
"[45:27] fe069 | Um ,"
[45:28] fe069 | as far as ideas about
[45:30] fe069 | looking at the data and getting ideas about
[45:31] fe008 | Yes .
[45:34] fe069 | whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out .
[45:35] fe008 | Yeah .
"[45:36] fe069 | One thing that I I 'm you probably don't remember this that I was really interested in is the use of "" so "" and the use of "" or "" ."
"[45:50] fe069 | I mean , computer people speech thing , but um ,"
[45:52] me070 | Hmm .
"[45:53] fe069 | people tend to end utterances quite often with "" so "" or "" or "" and trailing off ."
"[45:56] fe066 | Oh , yes ."
[45:57] me070 | M Mm - hmm .
[45:58] fe067 | Mmm .
"[45:59] fe066 | A couple people in particular do that , yeah ."
"[46:00] fe069 | Yeah , mm - hmm . And I found that really interesting , and I was curious to to figure out when that happened , if it happened in certain occasions and whatever , and I never really got around to it , but ."
"[46:01] fe008 | Mm - hmm , that 's right ."
"[46:09] fe008 | Do you people I mean , does everyone agree with that intu I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have "" so "" used as a final ,"
[46:09] fe068 | Uh - huh .
"[46:13] me070 | Oh , yeah ."
"[46:18] fe008 | uh ,"
"[46:20] fe069 | It didn't sound stran I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand ."
[46:20] me070 | Hmm .
[46:20] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[46:24] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[46:25] fe069 | But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really .
"[46:29] fe066 | I don't no , I don't agree necessarily . I do it ."
[46:30] fe069 | Really ?
[46:31] fe008 | I was wondering .
[46:32] fe069 | Really ?
"[46:32] fe066 | Yeah , I trail off with "" so "" ."
[46:34] fe069 | Huh .
"[46:34] fe066 | Um , I don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker I 'm thinking of , um ,"
[46:52] fe069 | Yeah .
[46:52] me070 | Right .
[46:56] fe069 | Like that you 're flexible ?
[46:57] fe066 | Right . Or you can build on it or j d
[46:59] me070 | Right .
[46:59] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:59] me070 | I think it 's sort of a like you guys can take from here , you know , somebody somebody build on my thought . It 's are you people also do it with "" but "" ."
[47:00] fe066 | expound on it .
[47:02] fe066 | Yeah .
[47:03] fe067 | Yeah .
[47:06] fe066 | It 's kinda like a shrug .
"[47:07] fe069 | Yeah , but it tends to happen I mean , "" so "" tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying . Or at least that 's what I found ."
[47:07] me070 | You know ?
[47:16] fe066 | What do you mean ?
[47:16] fe069 | Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something either a new topic or a different take on the same topic
[47:17] fe067 | Oh .
[47:25] fe067 | Hmm .
[47:27] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:27] fe069 | will tend to use will trail off with "" so "" ."
"[47:32] fe008 | Yes , that 's possible , yeah ."
"[47:32] fe069 | Yeah , kind of , yeah , yeah ."
[47:33] fe068 | Huh .
"[47:33] fe008 | Yeah , interesting ."
[47:35] fe069 | Yeah .
[47:39] fe068 | Yeah .
[47:39] fe067 | Mmm .
[47:39] fe069 | So .
[47:40] me070 | That 's true .
[47:40] fe069 | But .
[47:41] fe069 | I thought that was really interesting .
"[47:41] fe066 | Or y I 've heard you say "" so "" , in that sort of sense like uh , um ,"
"[47:47] fe066 | "" So in other words blah - blah - blah - blah . """
[47:49] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[47:51] fe008 | Of course b but that 's not really an example of this , because they don't just say "" so "" ."
[47:54] me070 | u Nnn .
[47:55] fe066 | That 's true .
"[47:55] fe008 | Is that right ? I mean , s I just wanna be sure ."
"[47:56] me070 | Ending with "" so "" ."
[47:57] fe066 | Or I maybe I 'm misunderstanding what you were sa
"[47:58] me070 | When you end with "" so "" ."
[47:59] fe069 | When you end the utterance .
"[48:00] fe066 | When Oh , just just ending with "" so "" . OK ."
[48:01] fe008 | Yeah .
"[48:01] me070 | Right , and you say "" so "" ."
[48:02] fe069 | Yeah .
"[48:03] fe008 | Yeah , "" I c I could get all those extra signatures , but I don't know , so . """
[48:07] me070 | Yeah .
[48:08] fe069 | Right .
[48:10] fe069 | Yeah .
[48:11] fe008 | That 's a very nice characterization .
[48:12] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[48:13] fe008 | Interesting .
"[48:16] fe069 | I 'd definitely like to look more at that if I can , but ."
[48:22] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:24] fe069 | Oh , yeah ."
"[48:26] me070 | you know , take it from here ? So , you know , "" Blah - blah - blah - blah - blah , but . """
[48:27] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:30] fe069 | "" But I 'm not really sure so you can you could finish my thought . """
"[48:31] me070 | Yeah , so s"
"[48:33] me070 | Um ,"
[48:33] fe069 | It 's a different kind of shrug though .
[48:40] fe066 | I could see that .
[48:40] fe069 | I think it shows less of confident like less confidence in what they just said in a way .
[48:40] fe067 | Mm - hmm .
[48:40] fe008 | OK .
[48:41] fe068 | Or giving permission ?
[48:42] me070 | Yeah .
[48:44] fe008 | OK .
[48:44] me070 | Yeah .
"[48:44] fe066 | Same with "" I don't know "" ."
[48:45] fe069 | Yeah .
"[48:45] fe066 | You can also end an utterance with ,"
"[48:47] fe066 | uh , "" blah - blah - blah but I don't know "" ."
[48:50] fe067 | Hmm .
[48:50] fe069 | Yeah .
[48:51] fe066 | Like that .
[48:51] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[48:51] fe069 | Yeah .
"[48:53] fe066 | Like , I feel like maybe that 's similar to "" but "" ."
"[48:55] fe069 | Yeah . More similar than to "" so "" I think ."
[48:55] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:56] fe008 | Yeah , that 's interesting ."
"[48:57] fe066 | To "" so "" , yeah . I think so too ."
[48:58] fe008 | Huh .
"[48:59] fe008 | Huh , interesting ."
"[49:00] fe008 | What about , um , the way people treat"
"[49:06] fe008 | they laugh and then after the laugh they say , "" uh "" ."
"[49:08] fe008 | I mean , if you so it 's like , "" ha - ha - ha uh "" ."
[49:13] fe008 | Do you Have you run across this ?
[49:14] fe067 | Mmm .
"[49:20] fe008 | you know , you you make a joke and then you have an "" uh "" in there somehow ,"
"[49:26] fe066 | Maybe it 's like saying like ,"
[49:35] fe069 | Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ? Like to connect it with what is going on
[49:38] fe068 | Hmm .
[49:39] fe067 | Mmm .
"[49:41] fe066 | Well , eh how OK , so the one I 'm thinking of is like if"

[49:56] fe066 | Yeah .
"[49:57] fe066 | Kinda , yeah , kinda like "" Uh . "" You know ."
[49:59] fe069 | Yeah .

"[50:26] fe008 | It 's just a normal "" uh "" . Mm - hmm ."
[50:27] fe069 | Yeah .
"[50:27] fe008 | But it 's stuck in maybe it 's a little louder than usual . It 's not any of the extra ,"
"[50:32] fe008 | um ,"
"[50:33] fe008 | you know , glottal thing ."
[50:33] fe067 | Hmm .
"[50:33] fe066 | Meaning , "" Let 's keep going "" ?"
[50:35] fe069 | Maybe it means that .
"[50:35] fe008 | Well ,"
[50:36] fe008 | but it just seems like it 's more prominent than You know it really is like a
[50:38] fe069 | Uh .
"[50:43] fe008 | which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker ,"
[50:48] fe066 | That 's yeah .
[50:49] fe069 | Maybe if maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something .
[50:50] fe066 | Yeah .
"[50:53] fe008 | Yeah , that 's possible . OK ."
[50:54] fe069 | I don't know .
"[50:54] fe066 | Yeah , like , "" Let 's come back to the original subject and I will take it from there "" ."
[50:59] fe008 | Oh . It could be .
"[51:00] fe008 | Yes , po that 's possible ."
[51:01] fe066 | Maybe .
"[51:02] fe066 | Cuz I 've heard , um , Morgan do that ."
[51:04] fe008 | Exactly who I was thinking of actually . Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Yeah .
"[51:05] fe066 | Yeah , he does that a lot ."
"[51:08] fe066 | For obvious reasons , probably , if that 's the way he uses it ."
"[51:11] fe008 | That 's true , that would The And he does continue after that . But it 's just you know , to say "" uh "" you kn to say "" uh "" while you 're laughing"
[51:14] me070 | Right .
[51:18] fe008 | i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category .
"[51:19] me070 | I think it may almost have to do with like ,"
"[51:21] me070 | "" OK , I told a joke , now everyone 's laughing , and now it 's common courtesy I 'll sort - of"
"[51:26] me070 | tell everyone to stop laughing , you know , so you don't offend me about"
"[51:29] me070 | how good my joke was . "" You know , it 's almost like , "" OK ,"
"[51:32] me070 | uh , OK , my joke 's over , you know , you can stop laughing now "" ."
[51:35] fe069 | Right .
[51:36] fe008 | That 's possible .
[51:36] fe067 | Mmm .
[51:38] fe068 | Hmm !
[51:39] fe066 | Yeah .
"[51:40] me070 | How do you you know , how much do you laugh after someone 's joke to"
"[51:41] fe066 | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[51:46] me070 | Yeah .
[51:47] me070 | Or how long do you wait after the joke
[51:49] me070 | to Right .
[51:52] fe008 | Very interesting . Interesting .
[51:53] fe069 | Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time .
[51:56] fe008 | Yes .
"[52:03] fe008 | Yeah , that 's that 's Huh , OK ."
[52:04] fe069 | It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time .
[52:09] me070 | Yeah .
"[52:09] fe069 | It 's hard to figure out what they 're doi what they 're talking about , and also they don't tend to talk very f there 's a lot of disfluencies when they 're laughing and talking ."
[52:16] me070 | Definitely .
[52:16] fe067 | Mmm .
"[52:18] me070 | Sometimes they make me laugh so hard , because they 'll just be talking about something technical and I 'll be so bored and then suddenly they 'll say something"
"[52:31] me070 | Like one time everybody was doing the , um , digits , and they were all doing it at the same time , and they started off kind of shaky , they were like , "" Oh , do we wanna do this at the same time , you know , that 's @ @ you know , wh let 's not all start laughing "" and then they all did it at the same time and"
"[52:37] fe068 | Oh , right ."
[52:49] fe068 | Yeah .
[53:01] fe066 | Johno keeps making comments about the transcribers .
[53:05] fe069 | Yeah .
[53:05] fe008 | Yes .
[53:06] fe068 | What does he say ?
[53:07] fe008 | He 's very funny .
[53:10] fe068 | Why ?
"[53:11] fe069 | "" Oh , but I don't mean the transcribers we have here of course . """
"[53:14] fe066 | Like Well sometimes he 'll do that , yeah . But sometimes he doesn't . And sometimes he 'll just be like uh ,"
"[53:19] fe066 | you know , um , "" Here , Transcribers , try transcribing this ! """
[53:28] fe008 | He 's very funny .
[53:29] fe069 | Yeah .
[53:38] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
"[53:40] fe008 | And he s he says , um , something like ,"
"[53:43] fe008 | uh ,"
[53:44] fe008 | I i and he 's m e they they have this nice
"[53:47] fe008 | @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on , and he says ,"
"[54:01] fe008 | Yeah , and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on , and he said , "" Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so "" and then she said , "" Well , no , sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ? "" and"
"[54:11] fe008 | he says "" Well , no , it should be channel so - and - so "" . And then it turned out it was channel so - and - so which he said , and and she said he s he said ,"
"[54:25] fe008 | They have this really nice You know , it 's really Those sorts of things , i it 's true , you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh ,"
[54:31] me070 | Yeah .
[54:31] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[54:31] fe066 | Yeah .
[54:32] fe067 | Hmm .
"[54:39] fe008 | eh the , uh ,"
[54:39] fe008 | eh little
[54:40] fe008 | periods of humor like that .
[54:42] fe069 | Yeah .
"[54:43] fe008 | Alright , well , so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired . If w if we wanted to do that ."
"[54:48] fe068 | Let 's do simultaneous digits . No , let 's let 's not ."
[54:50] fe008 | Let 's do simultaneous digits .
[54:51] fe066 | can somebody explain to me why you do digits ? I still don't really know .
"[54:52] fe008 | No , you don't ?"
[55:02] fe067 | Mmm .
[55:07] me070 | Mmm .
[55:07] fe068 | Yeah .
"[55:07] fe008 | so that we 're sure , as you 've done ."
"[55:09] fe068 | I remember I did that a little bit , and , yeah , you must have too ."
"[55:09] fe069 | Yeah , I did that once too ."
[55:10] fe008 | Yeah .
"[55:11] fe069 | Yeah , yeah ."
[55:11] fe008 | And you did also ?
[55:12] fe067 | We we are meant to be transcribing if they 're just left in the the curly brackets ?
[55:13] fe068 | Kinda early on .
[55:18] fe008 | it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface .
"[55:21] fe008 | I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then ,"
"[55:23] fe068 | Yeah , they do write the numbers in . Yeah ."
"[55:23] fe008 | you know , leave it , that 's fine . Yeah ."
[55:24] fe069 | The Yeah .
"[55:25] fe069 | Yeah , I 've been just leaving it ."
[55:25] fe067 | And sometimes they don't .
"[55:26] fe066 | Oh , I 've been writing the numbers just cuz I wasn't sure what to do ."
[55:26] fe008 | Sometimes they don't .
"[55:28] fe008 | Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well ."
"[55:28] me070 | Oh , really ?"
[55:30] fe066 | You don't have to ?
[55:31] fe008 | You don't have to .
"[55:31] fe066 | Oh , OK ."
[55:32] fe067 | Hmm .
"[55:32] fe008 | Because , uh , we 're we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this in this other"
"[55:36] fe008 | way , but"
"[55:37] fe008 | In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth , you know exactly what the person should have said and you check to be sure , and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked ."
[55:37] fe067 | Oh .
"[55:44] fe008 | Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices ,"
"[55:49] fe008 | uh , reading these things , and you can do really good speech recognition that way ."
"[55:56] fe008 | it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses . It 's nice to have ,"
[55:56] me070 | Huh .
[55:58] fe067 | Hmm .
"[55:59] fe008 | you know , a standard Uh , you know , it 's like ,"
"[56:02] fe008 | uh , psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here and then you can Yeah ."
[56:04] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:06] fe068 | Oh , yeah . No , I totally agree ."
[56:07] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
"[56:08] fe008 | I I agree , I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature ."
"[56:10] fe066 | Where 's the little things that 's supposed to say "" transcript L dash blah - blah - blah "" ?"
"[56:13] fe068 | Oh , it 's at the top ."
"[56:15] fe008 | Let 's see , I guess it would be it 's up there ."
"[56:17] me070 | It 's right here , yeah . I looked for that too ."
"[56:17] fe067 | Oh , I see ."
[56:18] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[56:18] fe008 | Up there at the top .
[56:18] fe066 | Ah . Oh . OK .
[56:20] fe069 | OK .
"[56:20] fe068 | So , I have a question ."
[56:21] fe008 | Yeah .
[56:22] fe068 | Cuz now I 'm looking at this
"[56:24] fe068 | and I realize I don't know the answer , is , um ,"
[56:27] fe068 | sometimes when people are reading
"[56:29] fe068 | "" zero "" , they say "" O "" , and sometimes they say "" zero "" , but And I thought"
[56:30] fe008 | Yeah .
[56:31] fe008 | Yes .
[56:31] fe067 | Yeah .
[56:32] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[56:34] fe068 | that there must be an indication here .
[56:36] fe008 | Used to be .
[56:36] fe069 | That 's what I thought too .
[56:37] fe008 | Used to be .
"[56:38] fe068 | Oh , that "" read O or read zero "" ."
[56:38] me070 | Hmm .
[56:41] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[56:43] fe066 | Oh .
"[56:43] fe068 | Oh , my !"
[56:44] fe008 | Yes .
"[56:44] me070 | Oh , wow ."
[56:45] fe068 | Yeah .
[56:48] fe068 | Yeah .
"[56:52] fe068 | Yeah , you 're not used to seeing the numbers like that ."
[56:54] fe069 | Yeah .
"[56:54] fe008 | and then you 'd have an "" OH "" periodically and , um , they were initially spelled out that way , one or the other ."
[56:56] me070 | Hmm .
[56:59] fe066 | Huh .
"[56:59] fe068 | I see , so that 's why ."
[57:13] me070 | Right .
[57:14] fe066 | Mm - hmm .
[57:14] fe068 | So it 's optional . You can say one or the other ?
[57:14] fe067 | Hmm .
"[57:17] fe008 | Yes , mm - hmm ."
[57:18] fe068 | OK .
[57:19] fe067 | Mmm .
[57:22] fe008 | Sure .
"[57:35] fe067 | Oh , OK ."
"[57:38] fe008 | different sized strings . But to have them broken up like this , it 's it 's m been about"
"[57:46] fe008 | or maybe maybe seven months , I don't know ,"
"[57:48] fe008 | maybe longer , that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line ."
[57:51] fe067 | Mmm .
[57:52] fe008 | So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that .
"[57:55] fe069 | But in the transcriptions I mean , we don't have to deal with that because when"
[57:58] fe008 | No .
[57:59] fe069 | the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever .
"[58:01] fe008 | That 's right , break it up more finely ."
[58:02] fe069 | Yeah .
"[58:02] fe067 | But if you can clearly hear pauses and there 've not been transcribed , we should be adding the commas or not ?"
[58:08] fe067 | Though the one I 'm working on now is like that .
"[58:10] fe008 | I would say don't worry about that , because , um ,"
[58:11] fe067 | OK .
"[58:16] fe008 | but , um ,"
"[58:17] fe008 | uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately , so it 's not so important . It 's more important to focus on the words , because there we don't know the ground truth ."
[58:23] fe069 | Mm - hmm .
[58:28] fe068 | Mm - hmm .
[58:30] fe008 | So .
[58:31] fe069 | Are we gonna do them together then ? Or no ?
"[58:33] fe008 | Well , I don't know , how do you feel ? I mean , what we could do is we could do it together one week and then separate the next or something like that to give the variety ."
"[58:34] fe068 | Yeah , I don't care . Whatever ."
[58:38] fe068 | Sure .
[58:39] fe066 | Sure .
[58:39] fe069 | Whatever .
"[58:40] fe008 | why don't we do them together this time just because in the interest of time , to get you out in time ."
[58:43] fe069 | OK .
[58:44] me070 | OK .
[58:44] fe066 | OK .
"[58:45] fe008 | OK , so , um ,"
[58:51] fe068 | Sure .
[58:54] me070 | Pause after each line ?
"[58:56] fe008 | Yeah , you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence ."
"[58:59] fe008 | What do they say , "" Each line"
[58:59] me070 | OK .
[59:10] me070 | Hmm .
[59:10] fe068 | Uh - huh .
[59:10] fe069 | Pause briefly between lines .
"[59:12] fe008 | Yes , there you go ."
[59:12] fe068 | Right .
[59:12] fe069 | OK .
"[59:13] fe008 | OK . So , here we go ."
[59:13] fe066 | OK .
[59:13] me070 | Alright .
"[59:14] fe008 | Ready , set , go ."
"[59:32] me070 | Three four one , nine seven seven , nine five eight nine ."
[00:16] fe068 | Aw !
[00:21] fe067 | It was hard !
"[00:25] fe008 | It 's it 's funny how distracting it is , you know ? It 's like there 's no content ."
[00:27] fe067 | It is .
"[00:28] fe069 | It is , it 's hard ."
[00:28] me070 | It is .
"[00:31] me070 | I finished my last one , it was really hard though ."
"[00:33] fe069 | OK , good ."
"[00:44] fe068 | Oh , that 's the killer ."
"[00:47] fe008 | OK , well , I wanna thank you very much , and um , look f and so we 'll meet next week at the same time , u unless I mean , I g I need to check on the schedule but I think , um ,"
[00:47] fe069 | Good .
[00:47] fe068 | Alright then .
[00:53] me070 | OK .
[00:54] fe066 | OK .
"[00:56] fe069 | OK , so unless we hear from you ."
[00:56] fe008 | The same same time or within an hour ra of it .
[00:58] fe069 | OK .
[00:58] me070 | OK .
[00:59] fe067 | OK .
[00:59] fe068 | Sounds good .
[00:59] fe008 | Good .
"[01:00] me070 | Sounds good , yeah ."
[01:00] fe008 | Great . Thanks very much .
[01:00] fe066 | OK .
[01:00] fe068 | OK .
[01:01] me070 | Alright .
[01:02] fe008 | Signing off .
[01:02] fe066 | Bye .
[01:03] me070 | @ @
"[01:04] fe066 | I love you , man ."
"[01:13] fe066 | to transcribe ? Oh , yeah ? Oh , OK ."
[01:16] fe066 | I was just curious .
[01:17] fe069 | And then we get to check it through it .
[01:20] fe069 | I think it 'll be interesting .
"[01:21] me070 | Yeah , I 'd like to ."
"[01:21] fe066 | Oh , yeah . Oh , totally , I wanna hear it , actually ."
[01:22] fe008 | I think it 's terrific .
"[01:23] me070 | Yeah , me too ."
"[01:24] fe068 | Well , we have to l hear it because we 're gonna get to we have to get to look at our version or whatever ."
"[01:26] fe008 | That 's right , you get the participant"
[01:28] fe069 | Approve it or whatever .
[01:28] fe008 | With correction . That 's right .
"[01:29] fe066 | Oh , good . Oh , that 's right ."
"[01:30] fe008 | You 're gonna go through the whole procedure . You get to see the the web interface and you listen to things , and Yeah ."
"[01:34] me070 | Oh , cool ."
[01:36] fe066 | Sign where ? I d Oh . Right .
"[01:36] fe069 | So we should leave all these things here , right ?"
[01:38] fe008 | Yeah .
"[01:41] fe068 | Yeah , looks good ."
[01:43] fe008 | Yes .
[01:48] fe068 | So I 'll I guess I 'll keep the agenda .
[01:50] fe069 | That 's what I was just gonna say .
[01:51] fe068 | Yeah .
[01:51] fe067 | Oh . OK .
"[01:52] me070 | Oh , yeah ."
[01:57] fe008 | It 's not as tight as I might have liked it but I just wanted to throw out as many ideas as I as I could .
"[02:00] fe068 | No , it 's great ."
[02:02] fe069 | I 'll just try and be extra aware during the next week and like note some things down .
"[02:05] fe008 | OK , that 's fine ."
[02:05] fe068 | Yeah .
[02:06] fe008 | Yeah . If you happen to think of some particular s startling changes that you came across . I 've run across I 'm gonna I think maybe I 'll bring in some examples that I 've run across that were surprising .
[02:07] me070 | Yeah .
"[02:17] fe008 | The Tigerfish people , cuz they don't have as much experience ,"
[02:20] fe008 | sometimes come up with some really surprising things .
"[02:29] fe008 | They were putting it in terms that had to do with finance . You know , I don't know how long they run into how often they run into "" granularity "" ."
"[02:32] fe066 | Hmm , mm - hmm ."
[02:33] me070 | Mm - hmm .
[02:33] fe068 | Right .
"[02:34] fe067 | Yeah , right ."
"[02:34] fe068 | And , like , statistical things . Like um ,"
[02:36] fe008 | Yeah .
"[02:43] fe068 | Oh ! So they 'll say things like "" correlation coefficient "" and they won't trans they they won't be able to transcribe that ."
[02:46] fe066 | Nope .
"[02:48] fe008 | Oh , I see ."
"[02:48] fe069 | Oh , they won't know what the word is ? Oh , that 's interesting ."
[02:50] fe068 | Yeah .
"[02:50] me070 | Oh , interesting ."
[02:51] fe066 | Oh .
"[02:51] fe068 | Um ,"
[02:52] me070 | @ @ .
"[02:53] fe068 | you know , just things like that ."
"[02:55] fe068 | "" Reliability analysis "" , that 's kinda easy though , that 's just you spell it out , but ."
[03:01] fe068 | Whatever .
[03:01] me070 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:03] fe068 | Oh , "" collinearity "" !"
"[03:04] fe008 | Oh , interesting ."
[03:04] fe068 | Colline - collinearity . That 's a statistical term .
[03:04] fe066 | What ?
[03:06] me070 | Collinearity .
"[03:06] fe008 | Oh , how was that one done ? Interesting ."
[03:10] fe066 | Really ?
"[03:10] fe008 | Yeah , OK , @ @"
"[03:11] fe066 | See , if I can hear it clearly enough , then I don't have a problem with it ."
"[03:13] fe068 | Yeah , then you 'd know the word ."
"[03:13] me070 | Yeah , @ @ ."
"[03:16] fe068 | You have to know that 's it 's spelled with two L 's though . It 's one word , it 's collinear it 's not "" co "" hyphen "" linearity "" . It 's "" collinearity "" ."
[03:18] me070 | Oh .
[03:20] fe066 | Oh . Oh .
[03:20] fe067 | I wouldn't know how to spell it .
[03:22] fe068 | Yeah .
[03:22] me070 | I wouldn't know that either .
[03:23] fe066 | I wouldn't have known that .
"[03:24] fe068 | Well , whatever ."
[03:25] fe066 | Now I do !
[03:29] fe066 | Right .
[03:30] fe067 | Hmm .
[03:34] fe008 | OK .
"[03:35] fe066 | You know , I found the mikes a little unnerving for the first half of the meeting ."
"[03:40] fe066 | Oh ,"
"[03:41] fe066 | just no , just that , um , I felt like on the spot a little bit ."
[03:45] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[03:45] fe069 | Yeah .
[03:45] fe068 | I got nervous a little .
[03:46] fe067 | I just tried not to worry about it .
[03:56] fe069 | I was very conscious of like coughing and stuff .
[03:58] fe008 | I think you did well . This was great .
[04:00] fe008 | That 's @ @ Thank you very much .
[04:03] fe008 | What 'd you say ?
[04:08] fe008 | Uh - huh .
[04:13] fe008 | Thanks again .

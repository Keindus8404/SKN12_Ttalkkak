[00:00] me045 | @ @
[00:00] me003 | How many batteries do you go through ?
[00:09] me045 | Thank you .
[00:09] me010 | Alright . Good .
[00:10] mn036 | Sure .
[00:13] me010 | Yeah .
"[00:15] me010 | OK so ,"
[00:17] me010 | let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be .
[00:21] me010 | Um .
[00:22] me010 | My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures
[00:31] me010 | uh to start .
"[00:33] me010 | So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI"
"[00:40] me010 | uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week"
"[00:44] me010 | and , I think got a lot done ."
"[00:48] mn015 | Yeah , I think so too ."
[00:49] mn015 | Um .
"[00:51] mn015 | The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll"
"[00:58] mn015 | go all the way through and then say something like "" Roman numeral one ,"
"[01:03] mn015 | am Smarticus . """
"[01:05] mn015 | It actually says , "" Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , "" which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for"
[01:09] me045 | OK .
"[01:13] mn015 | English sentences . So uh ,"
[01:15] me045 | OK .
"[01:16] me010 | It doesn't know "" I "" ."
[01:20] mn015 | the uh
[01:23] mn036 | Right .
"[01:24] mn015 | The uh sythesis is just a question of um ,"
[01:29] mn015 | hopefully it 's just a question of
"[01:30] mn015 | exchanging a couple of files , once we have them ."
"[01:34] mn015 | And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech"
"[01:40] mn015 | approach . So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now , so"
"[01:44] mn015 | "" synthesis "" is where you sort of make this uh , make these sounds ,"
"[01:48] mn015 | and "" concept to speech "" is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said ,"
"[01:53] mn015 | and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better ,"
"[01:57] mn015 | presumably . Then , just with text to speech ."
[01:59] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:00] mn015 | And , uh , Johno learned how to write"
[02:04] mn015 | XML tags .
"[02:06] mn015 | Uh , and did"
"[02:13] me003 | Yeah . So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person ,"
[02:21] me003 | to a er in XML
[02:24] me003 | and there 's a conversion system for different
"[02:26] me003 | uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base"
"[02:30] me003 | for the system ,"
"[02:32] me003 | that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh ,"
[02:38] me003 | in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is
[02:45] me003 | something based on Prolog .
"[02:47] me003 | So , you have a basically , a goal and it , you know , says "" OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the"
"[02:53] me003 | Greet - the - person goal , so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means "" build the tree . """
[02:54] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:02] me003 | And then it passes the tree onto , uh ,"
[03:02] me045 | OK .
[03:05] me003 | the ge the generation module .
[03:08] mn015 | But I think that the point is that out of the
"[03:10] mn015 | twelve possible utterances that the German system can do ,"
[03:16] mn015 | the syntax trees for
[03:18] mn015 | three or four .
"[03:18] me003 | We - yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,"
[03:23] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:23] me003 | and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and"
[03:32] me003 | made trees out of those .
"[03:34] me003 | And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take"
"[03:37] me003 | LISP notation and generate an XML , uh ,"
[03:40] me003 | tree .
"[03:42] me003 | Uh ,"
[03:44] me003 | S what do ca structure
[03:45] me003 | from the from the LISP .
"[03:47] me003 | And so basically you just say , you know ,"
"[03:49] me003 | "" noun goes to "" , you know ,"
"[03:52] me003 | Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things"
[03:56] me045 | OK .
"[03:57] me045 | N , V yeah , OK ."
"[03:58] me003 | in LISP , and it will generate for you ."
[04:02] me045 | Alright .
"[04:02] mn015 | And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that"
"[04:08] mn015 | f fancy stuff , and"
"[04:09] mn015 | the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us . So ."
[04:17] mn015 | This way we we worked around that .
"[04:19] mn015 | The , uh the system , um I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own ."
"[04:27] mn015 | If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future ."
[04:30] mn015 | Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch
"[04:37] mn015 | on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything ."
[04:43] mn015 | And send in a a a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually
"[04:50] mn015 | works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition"
[04:55] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:56] mn015 | running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we don't have here ."
"[05:00] mn015 | And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was It was a lot of"
[05:07] mn015 | engineering stuff .
"[05:09] mn015 | No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um ,"
[05:13] mn015 | that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .
"[05:19] me003 | Why I had I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like"
"[05:25] me003 | uh , the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,"
[05:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[05:29] me003 | so I 'd uh have to add "" am walking , "" or I 'd have to add a little stem for the "" am "" ,"
[05:31] me045 | OK .
[05:33] me045 | OK .
[05:34] me003 | when I build the built the tree .
"[05:35] me045 | Yeah , I noticed that um ,"
"[05:38] me045 | that some of the examples they had , had"
"[05:41] me045 | you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So . Like ."
[05:45] me003 | Yeah .
[05:45] me010 | Alright .
"[05:46] me010 | So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,"
[05:49] me045 | Yeah .
[05:49] me010 | um
[05:51] me003 | Well Tilman s
"[05:57] me045 | You know , I I still don't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh"
[06:06] me045 | um
[06:06] me045 | decides that it wants to
"[06:08] me045 | achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s"
"[06:12] me045 | I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ?"
[06:13] me010 | I thi
"[06:14] me010 | Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group , but sort of when you get"
[06:16] me045 | R uh Sure .
[06:19] me010 | free and you have the time
"[06:20] me045 | Yeah , soon ."
[06:21] me010 | uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .
[06:25] me045 | OK .
[06:26] me010 | And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .
[06:29] me045 | That 's fine .
[06:30] me010 | It 's eee messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's it 's There 's nothing really complicated about it .
[06:36] me045 | OK .
[06:36] mn015 | No .
[06:37] me045 | And I remember one thing that that came up in the talk last Wednesday .
"[06:41] me045 | Um ,"
[06:42] me045 | was
"[06:44] me045 | this , I I think he talked about the idea of like , um He was talking about these lexicalized"
"[06:50] me045 | uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of for each word you , um For each lexical item ,"
[06:57] me045 | the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And
"[07:03] me045 | of course ,"
[07:04] me045 | that 's not v
"[07:06] me045 | That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's that 's HPSG or whatever . You know ?"
[07:08] me010 | Right .
"[07:09] me010 | Right . Now , we 're we 're not"
[07:13] me010 | committed for our research
[07:14] me045 | Yeah .
[07:15] me010 | to do any of those things . So uh we are committed for our funding .
[07:18] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[07:21] me045 | Right .
"[07:25] me010 | Yeah , to n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need ."
[07:29] me045 | Uh - huh .
[07:30] me010 | OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also
"[07:36] me010 | give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great ."
[07:41] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[07:42] me010 | But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts
[07:44] me045 | OK .
"[07:45] me010 | and , s deliberately ."
"[07:48] me010 | So , the reason I 'd like you to understand"
[07:53] me010 | uh what 's going on
[07:55] me010 | in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just
[07:59] me010 | for closure . So that if we come up with a question of
"[08:02] me010 | "" could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? "" or something . You know what the hell"
[08:06] me045 | Right .
"[08:07] me010 | we we 're talking about fitting in . So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us"
[08:09] me045 | OK .
[08:13] me010 | we just need to really understand
[08:16] me010 | what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ?
"[08:21] me010 | Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ?"
[08:26] me010 | But none of that has a short time fuse .
[08:28] me045 | OK .
[08:28] me010 | So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of
"[08:33] me010 | taken care of as of later this week or something . And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until"
"[08:39] me010 | there 's another serious demo requirement . That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months , but it means we can not think about it for six months ."
[08:41] me045 | Oh OK .
[08:43] me045 | Right .
"[08:45] me045 | Right , yeah ."
[08:46] me010 | So . The plan for this summer
[08:46] mn015 | Right .
"[08:49] me010 | uh , really is to"
"[08:54] me010 | step back from the applied project ,"
"[08:57] me010 | keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues ."
[08:59] me045 | Hmm .
[09:01] me045 | Oh OK .
"[09:02] me010 | And , so"
[09:05] me010 | The idea is there 's this
"[09:07] me010 | uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing"
[09:11] me010 | the nota getting a notation . But
"[09:13] me010 | sort of in parallel with that ,"
"[09:15] me010 | uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on"
"[09:19] me010 | constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,"
[09:22] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[09:22] me010 | but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or
[09:26] me045 | Yeah .
[09:27] me010 | any of the other anything lik any other constraints
[09:30] me045 | OK .
[09:31] me010 | for the time being .
[09:32] me045 | Got it .
[09:32] me010 | It 's hard enough to
[09:34] me010 | get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff .
[09:36] me045 | Yeah .
"[09:40] me010 | And , I don I don't want you f"
[09:43] me010 | feeling
[09:45] me010 | that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .
"[09:47] me045 | Right , OK ."
"[09:48] me010 | Um . And similarly with the parsing ,"
[09:51] me010 | uh
[09:53] me010 | we 're gonna worry about parsing
"[09:55] me010 | uh , the general case"
"[09:57] me010 | you know , construction parser for general constructions ."
"[10:00] me010 | And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later ."
[10:07] me045 | OK .
"[10:07] me010 | So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode ."
"[10:11] me010 | And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well ."
[10:16] me010 | Right .
"[10:16] me045 | So I mean , the the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been sort of been geared towards this demo ,"
[10:20] me010 | Yeah .
[10:22] me010 | Yeah . But but we we 're swit
[10:23] me045 | and then that 's going to go away pretty soon .
[10:25] me010 | Right .
[10:25] me045 | OK . And then we 'll sort of shift gears a
[10:25] me010 | Yeah .
[10:26] me010 | Yeah .
"[10:27] me045 | Fairly substantially , huh ?"
"[10:28] mn015 | It 's got . What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a sort of an internal demo , and I I show you"
[10:28] me010 | Yeah .
"[10:37] mn015 | what I do ,"
[10:38] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:38] mn015 | I speak into it and you hear it talk ,"
[10:41] me045 | OK .
"[10:41] mn015 | and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun ."
[10:46] me045 | OK .
"[10:47] mn015 | And so you when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer ."
[10:51] me045 | Right .
[10:53] me045 | OK .
"[10:53] me010 | So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ?"
"[10:57] me010 | Just give a talk in the big room , and and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ?"
[11:04] mn015 | Absolutely .
"[11:05] me010 | Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing That 's the level at which"
"[11:09] me010 | you know we can just li invite everybody and say "" this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it "" and stuff like that ."
[11:12] me045 | Yeah .
[11:15] mn015 | Well d we we do wanna have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of
[11:22] me045 | Uh - huh .
[11:22] me010 | Indeed .
[11:23] mn015 | Yeah .
[11:25] mn015 | OK . Makes sense .
"[11:26] me010 | But any so that e e It 's clear , then , I think ."
"[11:29] me010 | Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report ."
[11:34] me045 | Yeah .
[11:38] me045 | OK .
[11:39] me010 | But uh starting next meeting I think we want to
"[11:45] me010 | Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things ."
[11:49] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[11:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:54] me010 | But , more focused on"
[11:57] me010 | uh an idealized version than
[12:00] me010 | just getting the demo out .
"[12:03] me010 | Now before we do that ,"
"[12:06] me010 | let 's get back in Oh ! But ,"
"[12:08] me010 | it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version"
[12:12] me045 | Yeah .
"[12:12] me010 | enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might"
[12:19] me010 | eventually get retro - fitted into or something .
"[12:21] me045 | OK , right ."
"[12:23] me010 | And Johno 's already done that ,"
"[12:26] me010 | uh , looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff ."
[12:31] me003 | To some de uh what what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?
"[12:34] me010 | Well , the parser , and that stuff ."
[12:35] me003 | Oh yeah yeah .
"[12:37] me010 | OK . Anyway . So , the trip the report on these the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week ."
[12:42] me045 | Yeah . It 's alright .
[12:49] mn015 | Well it was
[12:51] mn015 | just amazing to to see uh
[12:58] mn015 | And I g I got the feeling that
[13:00] mn015 | we are the only ones right now who have a running system . I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because
"[13:07] mn015 | e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work ."
[13:12] mn015 | And you need to do a lot of
"[13:18] mn015 | And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said "" yeah"
[13:21] mn015 | there never was a really working version that uh
"[13:24] mn015 | did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version "" . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now ,"
[13:32] mn015 | the system the integration group .
"[13:35] mn015 | And it was , uh It was fun to some extent , but the uh"
"[13:46] mn015 | um , I know that they enjoyed it here ,"
"[13:48] mn015 | and they r they they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here ,"
"[13:52] mn015 | what what we have been thinking about ,"
[13:54] mn015 | and they 're more than willing to to
"[13:57] mn015 | um , cooperate , by all means ."
"[13:59] mn015 | And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal "" group - ware """
"[14:05] mn015 | server at EML , make that open to all of us and them ,"
[14:08] mn015 | so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w
[14:13] mn015 | we we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there
[14:17] mn015 | and maybe we can even
"[14:19] mn015 | um ,"
"[14:21] mn015 | get some overlap , get some synergy out of that ."
"[14:24] mn015 | And um ,"
[14:33] mn015 | I may even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is
"[14:41] mn015 | as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees ,"
"[14:47] mn015 | H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction ."
[14:49] mn015 | So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and
"[14:54] mn015 | there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely"
"[14:58] mn015 | focused on the understanding ,"
"[15:01] mn015 | um , pipeline ."
[15:06] me010 | Anyth - any other
[15:09] me010 | uh repo visit reports sort of stories ?
[16:56] me010 | uh we so we now know
"[16:58] me010 | I think , what the landscape is like ."
[17:00] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[17:01] me010 | And so we just push on and and
"[17:04] me010 | uh , do"
[17:07] me010 | what we need to do .
[17:10] me010 | And one of the things we need to do
"[17:13] me010 | is the um ,"
[17:17] me010 | and this I think is relatively
"[17:20] me010 | tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So ."
[17:25] me010 | Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions .
[17:33] me010 | OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um .
[17:39] me010 | Going back I guess two weeks ago
[17:41] me010 | uh Robert had
"[17:44] me010 | laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ?"
"[17:48] me010 | That is So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we"
"[17:52] me010 | went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that"
"[17:57] me010 | at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there ."
[18:03] me010 | Yeah we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections weren't .
"[18:07] me010 | So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about"
[18:13] me010 | were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them
"[18:22] me010 | or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff ."
[18:26] me010 | And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be
"[18:30] me010 | uh , "" no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do "" ."
"[18:36] me010 | And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um"
[18:44] me010 | we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net
[18:48] me010 | for this particular subdomain
[18:52] me010 | done in the next few weeks .
"[18:54] me010 | So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and"
"[18:58] me010 | uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh hopefully a belief - net that"
[19:06] me010 | does these things .
"[19:08] me010 | And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and"
[19:13] me010 | uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual
[19:16] me010 | semantics .
"[19:17] me010 | OK ? What all you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate ."
[19:23] me010 | So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group
[19:27] me010 | on the
[19:29] me010 | technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately . But in terms of
[19:33] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[19:35] me010 | what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we"
[19:40] me010 | all have to work out .
[19:43] me010 | Is is that right ?
[19:44] me010 | I mean that 's that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ? OK .
[19:46] mn015 | Absolutely .
"[19:49] me012 | So , I guess , um Is there like a latest version of the"
[19:53] me012 | belief - net of the proposed belief - net ?
[19:59] mn015 | Um .
"[20:00] mn015 | Well , no , we didn't decide . We wanted to look into maybe"
"[20:03] mn015 | getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think"
"[20:07] mn015 | if we do it , um ,"
[20:09] mn015 | sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then
[20:11] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:13] mn015 | the connections between them ,"
"[20:14] me012 | Yeah , that should be fine ."
[20:15] mn015 | that should suffice .
"[20:16] me010 | Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem . We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff ."
[20:19] mn015 | Yeah .
"[20:20] me010 | That 's separable , yeah ."
"[20:21] me003 | I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag"
[20:23] me010 | Yep .
[20:25] me010 | Right .
[20:26] me003 | JavaBayes does not support that .
[20:27] me003 | I can
[20:28] me003 | imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that .
"[20:32] me003 | It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,"
[20:35] me010 | Not not at this point .
"[20:35] me003 | and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page , and I couldn't"
[20:38] me010 | Right .
[20:40] me003 | find the necessary mix of free and uh
"[20:46] me003 | with the GUI and , with this thing that we want ."
"[20:48] me010 | Well , we can p If it 's If we can pay Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that ."
[20:52] me010 | OK ? So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint .
[20:52] me003 | OK .
[20:59] me010 | OK . And you can ask Kevin .
[20:59] me012 | Yeah .
[21:01] me003 | Mmm .
"[21:03] me010 | Hugin , yeah that 's free ."
"[21:08] me010 | Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I I don't know ."
"[21:11] me010 | I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded . So , at one point it was free ."
[21:13] me012 | OK .
[21:16] me012 | OK .
"[21:17] me010 | Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um ,"
[21:23] me003 | How do you spell that ?
[21:24] me010 | HUGIN .
"[21:26] me010 | And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um But paying a lit You know , if i if"
"[21:33] me010 | it 's uh Probably for university , it 's it 's gonna be real cheap anyway ."
"[21:37] me010 | But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that ."
[21:42] mn015 | I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code . I I will send you a pointer to a Java applet
"[21:46] me010 | No , he 's not gonna do that ."
[21:47] me045 | Yeah .
[21:47] me003 | OK .
"[21:50] mn015 | that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You you have a node , and you"
"[21:53] mn015 | click on it , and it shows you all the connections , and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle ."
[21:55] me003 | Mmm .
[21:59] mn015 | And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two .
"[22:02] mn015 | If that doesn't work ,"
[22:03] mn015 | it 's not a problem we we need to solve right now .
"[22:06] mn015 | What I 'm what my job is , I will , um ,"
[22:09] mn015 | give you the input
[22:11] mn015 | in terms of of
[22:16] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[22:18] me010 | Doesn't matter .
"[22:19] me012 | Um , just any like like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best ."
[22:23] mn015 | OK .
[22:24] mn015 | And um
[22:26] mn015 | you 're gonna be around ?
"[22:27] mn015 | t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ?"
[22:30] mn015 | As usual ?
[22:32] mn015 | Or will that change ?
"[22:42] me012 | I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days ."
[22:45] mn015 | Yeah . OK .
"[22:47] me010 | Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should ,"
"[22:52] me010 | you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this ."
[22:57] mn015 | Yeah .
[22:58] mn015 | OK .
"[22:58] mn015 | No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So ."
[23:02] me012 | OK .
[23:04] me045 | How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different
[23:10] me010 | Right .
[23:12] me010 | Well there there there
[23:14] me010 | There 're two different things you do . One is you design and the other is you learn .
[23:18] me010 | OK ?
"[23:19] me010 | So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design ,"
"[23:23] me010 | and , i if you will , guess ."
[23:26] me045 | OK .
[23:26] me010 | OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to
[23:29] me045 | Right .
"[23:31] me010 | uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff ."
[23:34] me045 | OK .
"[23:35] me010 | If it 's done right ,"
[23:37] me010 | and if you have data
[23:39] me045 | Yeah .
"[23:39] me010 | then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure"
"[23:43] me010 | and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although"
"[23:47] me010 | that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh"
[23:52] me010 | but for the limited amount of stuff
[23:55] me010 | we have for this particular exercise
[23:58] me010 | I think we 'll just design it .
[23:59] me045 | Alright .
[24:01] mn015 | Yeah .
[24:01] mn015 | Fo -
[24:02] mn015 | Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and
[24:07] me045 | OK .
[24:08] mn015 | from people actually using it and stuff .
[24:09] mn015 | So but this is the long run .
[24:12] me045 | Yeah .
[24:13] mn015 | But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .
"[24:17] me045 | Yeah , that 's right ."
"[24:19] me045 | Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there"
"[24:23] me045 | I could swore uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial"
[24:30] me045 | interactions of people with the with the system ?
[24:33] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:36] me045 | look at the stuff , and see what people are saying ."
[24:36] me010 | Yeah .
"[24:37] me010 | Yeah make yourself a note . So and and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get ."
"[24:45] mn015 | Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah ."
"[24:47] me010 | Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one ."
"[24:51] mn015 | That 's important , yeah ."
[24:53] me010 | So he 'll get you some data .
"[24:53] me045 | Yeah , u"
[24:54] me045 | OK .
"[24:55] me045 | Yeah , I mean I I sort of um"
"[24:57] me045 | found the uh ,"
[24:59] me045 | uh the audio
"[25:00] me045 | of some of those , and um ,"
[25:01] mn015 | Hmm .
"[25:06] me045 | Strange , but ."
[25:07] me010 | Yep .
[25:08] mn015 | We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .
"[25:11] me045 | Oh yeah , OK ."
"[25:12] mn015 | Um , but uh that 's th"
[25:15] mn015 | but we have data in English and German already . So . Transcribed . I will send you that .
"[25:17] me045 | OK , yeah , I mean ."
[25:23] mn015 | OK .
"[25:39] me010 | OK , so"
"[25:41] me010 | while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that"
[25:45] me010 | we oughta talk about today ?
[25:53] mn015 | Ho - how was your
[25:55] mn015 | thingy .
"[27:03] me045 | Oh , um ,"
"[27:04] me045 | I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I wasn't"
[27:12] me010 | Oh right .
[27:20] me045 | to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like
"[27:23] me045 | you know , "" What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , "" or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some"
"[27:31] me045 | reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of"
"[27:34] me045 | you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gonna be very relevant . So ,"
"[27:41] me045 | the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese doesn't"
"[27:46] me045 | affect us directly , except that , um ,"
"[27:48] me045 | some of the construction he 'd what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , "" your bike is parked across the street """
"[27:55] me045 | and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , "" well ,"
[28:01] me045 | in Japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of
"[28:07] me045 | "" where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree "" ."
"[28:10] me045 | Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um ,"
"[28:14] me045 | "" there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river "" , or something like that ."
[28:31] me010 | Mmm .
[28:33] me010 | how much is that used in German ?
[28:36] mn015 | Um .
"[28:39] mn015 | I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack . I mean ,"
"[28:42] me010 | Oh , OK ."
"[28:43] mn015 | the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment ,"
"[28:47] mn015 | but this is a a three language project : German , English , Japanese ."
[28:51] me045 | OK .
"[28:51] mn015 | And um ,"
[28:55] mn015 | I have taken care that we have the the Japanese generation and stuff . And so
"[29:00] mn015 | I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B ."
[29:06] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:06] mn015 | And and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese . And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions ."
"[29:16] mn015 | Well , if yo if you 're interested in that ,"
"[29:18] mn015 | so how how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent . So ."
[29:22] me045 | OK .
[29:24] mn015 | Um .
"[29:25] me010 | So , where is this huge project ?"
[29:27] mn015 | It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld
[29:30] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[29:31] mn015 | generation of uh
[29:33] mn015 | spatial descriptions and whatever .
[29:35] mn015 | @ @
"[29:36] me010 | Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at ."
"[29:39] mn015 | But um , I I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for for now , but um"
[29:43] me045 | Yeah .
[29:44] mn015 | definitely it 's interesting to look at at
[29:46] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[29:46] mn015 | cross
[29:48] mn015 | the bordered there .
[29:49] mn036 | Are are you going to p pay any attention to
[29:54] mn036 | of of the direction relative relative to the speaker ?
"[29:57] mn036 | For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English ."
[30:00] mn036 | We can say
[30:01] mn036 | um
"[30:02] mn036 | "" park in front of the car """
[30:04] mn036 | as you come beh you drive behind the car .
[30:06] mn036 | In Hebrew it means
"[30:08] mn036 | "" park behind the car "" , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you ."
[30:10] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:10] mn015 | Intrinsic , yeah ."
"[30:12] mn036 | While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car ."
[30:12] me045 | OK .
"[30:15] me045 | Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . OK ."
[30:16] mn036 | So .
[30:17] mn036 | Right .
[30:18] mn036 | Right .
"[30:20] mn036 | So , i i i is German"
[30:21] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[30:21] mn036 | uh
"[30:22] mn036 | closer to to E uh , uh , uh , uh to E I mean uh"
"[30:25] mn036 | I don't think it it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different ."
"[30:28] me010 | No , it 's not ."
[30:28] me045 | Right .
[30:29] mn036 | Yeah .
[30:29] mn015 | Um .
[30:31] mn015 | Did you ever get to look at the the rou paper that I sent you on the on that problem in English and German ?
[30:40] mn015 | Um .
[30:41] mn015 | I There is a a study
[30:44] mn015 | on the differences between English and German on exactly that
[30:47] mn015 | problem .
[30:47] mn036 | Hmm .
"[30:48] mn015 | So it 's they actually say "" the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? """
[30:51] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:52] mn015 | And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German ,"
[31:01] mn015 | that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .
[31:04] mn015 | The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .
[31:04] me045 | Hmm .
"[31:09] mn015 | That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely ,"
[31:10] mn036 | Right .
[31:11] mn036 | Mm - hmm .
[31:12] mn036 | Right .
"[31:14] mn015 | you know ,"
"[31:15] mn015 | to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames ."
[31:22] me010 | Hmm .
"[31:22] me045 | I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in in English depending o You know , like , "" in front of the car "" could you know Like ,"
[31:32] me010 | Absolutely .
"[31:34] me045 | But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was this was a a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh ."
"[31:40] mn015 | I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames . So . I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works ."
[31:48] me010 | Oh .
[31:51] me010 | Oh .
[31:52] mn015 | Not really .
"[31:54] me010 | Great . No , I 've not seen that ."
[31:56] mn036 | What do you mean . Um .
"[31:57] mn036 | "" reference frames "" ?"
[31:58] mn036 | uh
[32:01] mn036 | uh
[32:02] mn015 | Um .
"[32:09] mn015 | I should there should be an "" L "" , though ."
[32:11] mn015 | Well actually you have only have two choices . You can either do a two - point
[32:16] mn015 | or a three - point
[32:18] mn015 | which is you
"[32:19] mn015 | You 're familiar with th with the "" origo "" ?"
"[32:22] mn015 | where that 's the center "" Origo "" is the center of the f frame of reference . And then you have the"
[32:26] me045 | Hmm .
[32:27] mn015 | reference object and the object to be localized .
[32:32] me045 | Hmm .
[32:32] mn015 | OK ? In some cases the origo
[32:33] mn036 | Mm - hmm .
[32:35] mn015 | is
[32:37] mn015 | the same
[32:38] mn015 | as the reference object .
"[32:41] me010 | So that would be "" origin "" in English , right ?"
[32:42] me045 | The origin . Yeah .
[32:43] mn036 | Right
"[32:44] mn015 | "" Origo "" is a Terminus technikus . in that sense ,"
"[32:46] mn015 | that 's even used in the English literature . "" Origo . """
"[32:49] me045 | Oh , OK . I never heard it . OK ."
[32:49] me010 | Alright .
[32:50] mn036 | OK .
"[32:51] mn015 | And um ,"
"[32:53] mn015 | so ,"
[32:54] mn015 | this video tape is in front of me . I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object . Those are two - point .
[32:56] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[32:58] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[32:58] mn036 | Right .
[33:00] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[33:00] mn015 | And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f
[33:05] me010 | Yeah .
[33:07] mn015 | shoe is behind the chair .
[33:08] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:10] mn015 | And ,"
[33:11] mn015 | reference object and Um .
"[33:13] mn015 | No , from from my point of view your shoe is"
[33:15] me045 | Right .
[33:16] mn015 | left of the chair .
"[33:17] me045 | You you can actually say things like , um ,"
[33:24] mn015 | Yeah .
[33:27] mn015 | Yeah .
"[33:28] mn015 | So ,"
[33:28] fe004 | Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time .
"[33:31] me010 | Yeah , it sounds like it , doesn't it , yeah ."
[33:32] fe004 | It 's a lot like it . Um .
[33:32] me045 | Yeah .
"[33:33] mn015 | And then and then here you On this scale , you have it either be ego"
[33:38] mn015 | or allocentric .
[33:40] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[33:42] mn015 | And that 's that 's basically
"[33:45] mn015 | it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric ."
"[33:50] mn015 | So , "" as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that"
"[33:50] me045 | Oh , OK ."
"[33:55] mn015 | um , fire station "" ."
[33:57] mn015 | It 's hardly ever used but it 's w
[33:58] mn036 | I 'd love to see it if you if you have a copy kind of . Uh .
[33:59] me010 | Yeah . I see this is this is getting into Ami 's thing .
[34:00] me045 | Yeah .
[34:03] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[34:03] me010 | He 's he 's very interested in that .
[34:03] mn036 | Here
[34:04] mn015 | OK .
"[34:04] me010 | So . Uh . Yeah . Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU Right ?"
[34:05] me045 | Me too .
"[34:09] mn015 | Yeah it 's or or just Yeah . It 's also all on my my home page at EML . It 's called "" An Anatomy of a Spatial Description "" . But I 'll send that link ."
[34:11] me010 | Or a link to it .
[34:14] me010 | Just
"[34:16] mn036 | OK , great ."
"[34:17] me010 | Maybe just put a link on . Yeah . By the way , there something that I didn't know until about"
[34:17] mn015 | Yep . Yep .
"[34:22] me010 | a week ago or so ,"
"[34:23] me010 | is apparently ,"
[34:25] me010 | there are
[34:27] me010 | separate brain areas
[34:29] me010 | for
"[34:31] me010 | things within reach , and things that are out of reach ."
[34:34] me010 | So there 's there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about
[34:34] me045 | Huh .
"[34:37] me010 | you know , near and far , or yon and and so forth . So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently ,"
[34:45] me010 | the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go .
"[34:48] me010 | That ,"
"[34:49] me010 | you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach"
[34:58] me010 | uh a different one .
"[35:00] me010 | But here 's the the amazing result ,"
"[35:02] me010 | um ,"
[35:04] me010 | they say .
[35:05] me010 | You get someone with a with a deficit
[35:08] me010 | so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So
"[35:13] me010 | the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say ,"
"[35:19] me010 | "" Where 's the midpoint ? "" And they do fine ."
"[35:21] me010 | If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they can't ."
"[35:24] me010 | There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that ."
[35:28] me010 | Here 's the real experiment .
"[35:29] me010 | The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , "" where is it ? "" ,"
"[35:32] me010 | they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say "" do it "" , they can't do it ."
[35:32] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[35:36] me010 | So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .
[35:41] mn036 | Right .
[35:43] fe004 | Because it 's within reach now ?
[35:45] me010 | It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach
"[35:45] me045 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[35:48] me010 | uh , mechanism . So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference ."
[35:50] mn036 | Right .
"[35:51] me010 | And so this doe This is , uh First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about"
[35:56] me010 | and I 'll do this this test on you guys as well . So .
[36:00] me010 | Uh .
[36:01] me010 | How -
"[36:02] me010 | I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time ,"
[36:10] me010 | I start feeling the tip
[36:13] me010 | directly .
"[36:14] me010 | Not indirectly , but you actually can feel"
[36:16] me045 | Yeah yeah .
"[36:17] me010 | the tip . And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you"
[36:20] me045 | Yeah .
[36:23] me010 | get a direct sensation
"[36:25] me010 | of , physical sensation , of"
[36:29] me010 | the end affector .
"[36:31] mn036 | The ext the the The extension , right ."
[36:31] me010 | Huh ?
"[36:32] me045 | What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever ."
"[36:33] me010 | Yeah , within Huh ?"
"[36:34] mn036 | The extension of of your hand , right ."
"[36:36] me010 | Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ?"
[36:38] mn036 | I I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly
"[36:41] mn036 | the th same thing , but but s it it it 's getting close to that ."
[36:44] fe004 | W what does it feel like ?
[36:44] me045 | Yeah .
[36:46] me010 | Oh i it feels like your as if your
"[36:50] me010 | uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and and you deal directly with it ."
[37:01] mn036 | I I was playing you know with those um
[37:04] mn036 | uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ?
"[37:08] me010 | Right , yeah yeah yeah . Yeah ."
"[37:08] me045 | Oh , OK ."
[37:08] mn036 | So you can insert your hand something
[37:11] me010 | Yeah .
"[37:12] mn036 | So I played with it . After a while ,"
[37:14] mn036 | you don't feel the difference anymore .
"[37:15] me010 | Yeah , right ."
[37:15] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[37:17] mn036 | Very kind of you stop back
[37:19] mn036 | and suddenly it goes away
[37:20] mn036 | and you have to kind of work again
"[37:20] me010 | Right , right ."
"[37:22] mn036 | to recapture it , but yeah ."
"[37:23] me010 | Yeah , so anyway , so So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff ."
[37:24] me045 | That 's cool .
[37:30] me010 | And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why
[37:34] me010 | languages
"[37:35] me010 | uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't ."
[37:41] me045 | Yeah .
[37:41] me010 | But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied
"[37:45] me010 | neural difference . And i this is , um So . In addition to the"
[37:49] me010 | e
[37:49] mn015 | This is more proximal - distal .
[37:51] me010 | Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric
"[37:55] me010 | uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal"
[38:00] me010 | thing which is very deeply uh embedded .
[38:04] me010 | S
"[38:05] mn015 | Well , Dan Montello sort of , he he does the uh uh th the cognitive map"
"[38:09] mn015 | world , down in Santa Barbara ."
[38:14] mn015 | He he already well i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .
[38:17] me010 | Yeah .
"[38:22] me010 | Well there 's there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw ."
"[38:28] me010 | Anyway yeah , so we 'll we 'll look at this ."
"[38:31] me010 | And . So , all of these issues now are now starting to come up . So , now we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about"
"[38:39] me010 | uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff ,"
[38:45] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[38:46] me010 | uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , um So , all of this stuff is"
[38:49] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[38:55] me010 | coming up essentially starting now .
[38:57] me010 | So we gotta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up .
"[39:04] me010 | So "" OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need"
"[39:08] me010 | our system . "" Right ? It it follows . And so ,"
"[39:13] me010 | uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something"
"[39:23] me010 | and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the"
"[39:35] me010 | um , the grammar stuff . But"
[39:37] me045 | Alright .
[39:38] me010 | to do that
[39:39] me010 | we 're gonna need to make some decisions like
"[39:42] me010 | ontology ,"
"[39:44] me010 | so , um And so this is another thing where we 're gonna , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on"
"[39:54] me010 | uh , "" is there an ontology API"
"[39:58] me010 | that that "" There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we"
"[40:02] me010 | build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so For example , is there something"
[40:10] me010 | that we can use there .
[40:12] me010 | i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML
[40:19] me010 | have something that we can just
"[40:22] me010 | p pull out , for that ."
"[40:25] me010 | Uh , so there are gonna be some some some things like that , which are"
[40:31] me010 | not science but system .
[40:35] me010 | But we aren't gonna ignore those cuz we 're we 're not only going The plan is not only to
"[40:39] me010 | lay out this thing , but to actually uh"
[40:42] me010 | build
[40:44] me010 | some of it .
"[40:45] me010 | And how much we build , and and so forth ."
"[41:24] me010 | Uh . Part of it , if it works right ,"
[41:27] me010 | is wh It looks like we 're now in a position
[41:30] me010 | that
[41:32] me010 | the
[41:33] me010 | construction analyzer that we want for this
[41:36] me010 | applied project
[41:38] me010 | can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling .
[41:44] me010 | So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that
"[41:48] me010 | um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and"
[41:53] me010 | the hope
"[41:55] me010 | is that we can make these things the same thing ,"
[41:57] me045 | OK .
[41:58] me010 | and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .
[42:02] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[42:02] me010 | But it would be nice if that piece
[42:05] me010 | were exactly the same piece . It was just this
[42:06] me045 | Right .
[42:07] me010 | uh
[42:09] me010 | construction analyzer .
[42:11] me010 | And so we think we think we
[42:14] me010 | have a shot at at that .
[42:15] me045 | OK .
"[42:29] me010 | So . The for So . To to come full circle on that , this formalization task ,"
[42:34] me010 | OK ? is trying to
[42:38] me010 | get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually
[42:44] me045 | Yeah .
[42:44] me010 | uh d
"[42:46] me010 | Well , yeah , where it actually is is covers the whole range of things ."
[42:50] me010 | And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he
"[42:57] me010 | had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and"
"[43:00] me010 | he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space ."
[43:08] me045 | OK .
"[43:09] me010 | And it just it was just terribly frustrating for him , and he seemed fully committed to both"
[43:12] me045 | Yeah .
[43:15] me010 | sides of this
[43:16] me045 | I see .
[43:17] me010 | i i irreconcilable thing .
[43:19] me010 | And .
[43:22] me010 | Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .
[43:25] me045 | OK .
[43:25] me010 | Uh .
[43:26] me010 | Huh ?
"[43:27] me010 | Is This is true , is it not ?"
[43:28] me003 | Yes .
"[43:29] me010 | OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being"
"[43:35] me045 | Oh , OK ."
"[43:36] me010 | uh , complete ."
[43:37] fe004 | You don't have a hidden purist streak ?
[43:38] me003 | Oh no .
[43:43] me003 | No sir .
[43:44] me045 | Alright .
[43:45] me010 | Um .
"[43:47] me010 | Now , you do , but that 's OK ."
[43:51] me010 | Exactly right .
[43:53] me010 | Exactly .
[43:55] fe004 | It 's So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably . Which meeting I 'm in .
[43:56] mn036 | Hmm .
[44:07] me010 | Uh .
"[44:08] me010 | Within that , yeah , and uh , it 's a and still , I think , you know , get something done ."
[44:15] me010 | But to try to do something upscale and purist
[44:15] fe004 | Yay .
[44:17] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[44:19] me010 | Particularly if if
[44:20] me010 | um
"[44:22] me010 | what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , is real hard ."
[44:25] me010 | OK . And then the other thing is
[44:27] mn036 | @ @ It 's possible yeah .
[44:28] me010 | while we 're doing this
[44:29] me010 | uh
"[44:31] me010 | Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,"
[44:33] me045 | OK .
"[44:33] me010 | OK ,"
"[44:34] me010 | uh ,"
[44:36] me010 | for
"[44:37] me010 | his absentee thesis . I think you all know that that you can just , in Germany almost just send in your thesis ."
[44:43] mn036 | Um
[44:44] mn015 | The - th
[44:46] mn015 | There there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh joint over in Saarbruecken .
"[44:50] me010 | It costs a lot . The the amount You put in your credit card and as well . But , uh , But anyway , so , uh ,"
[45:00] me010 | that 's
"[45:02] me010 | um , also"
"[45:04] me010 | gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that that it becomes clear"
"[45:10] me010 | uh , what piece"
"[45:13] me010 | uh , Robert wants to jump into ."
"[45:15] me010 | And , while we 're at this level , uh ,"
[45:20] me010 | there 's at least one new
"[45:23] me010 | doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either"
"[45:27] me010 | next week or the first of August , depending on"
"[45:30] me010 | the blandishments of Microsoft . So , de"
[45:33] me010 | Uh . And her name is Eva .
[45:35] me045 | OK .
"[45:38] fe004 | Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke ,"
[45:41] me010 | Yeah .
"[45:46] me010 | No , first year coming . So , she 's she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of"
[45:50] me012 | OK .
"[45:53] me010 | then . And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that ."
[45:56] me012 | OK .
[45:59] mn015 | Document .
[45:59] me010 | Uh .
[46:01] me012 | Right .
[46:05] me010 | And actually I talked today to a
[46:08] me010 | uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this .
[46:13] fe004 | Someone from the class ?
"[46:15] me010 | No , interestingly enough ."
"[46:16] fe004 | We always get these people who are not in the class , who It 's interesting ."
"[46:18] me010 | Some of th some of them , yeah ."
"[46:20] me010 | So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on ."
[46:25] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:26] me010 | Uh , so ,"
"[46:28] me010 | um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read ."
[46:31] me010 | So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming
"[46:35] me010 | first incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes ."
"[46:39] me010 | Um ,"
"[46:41] me010 | anyway ,"
"[46:43] me010 | so ,"
[46:45] me010 | I think as far as
"[46:47] me010 | this group goes ,"
"[46:50] me010 | um ,"
[46:53] me010 | it 's certainly worth continuing
[46:57] me010 | for the next few weeks
[46:59] me010 | to get closure
[47:01] me010 | on the uh
"[47:04] me010 | belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts ."
[47:09] me010 | We 'll see
[47:11] me010 | whether
[47:13] me010 | it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other
"[47:19] me010 | bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w"
[47:24] me010 | what your thesis turns out to be and
[47:26] me010 | how that goes .
"[47:28] me010 | S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it and uh ,"
[47:35] mn036 | OK .
"[47:35] me010 | it it 's beginning to take shap shape , so"
[47:38] me010 | uh
[47:38] mn036 | Right
"[47:40] me010 | and , I think you will find"
[47:43] me010 | that
[47:44] me010 | if you want to
[47:47] me010 | look technically
"[47:48] me010 | at some of the your traditional questions in this light ,"
"[47:53] me010 | uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be"
[47:57] me010 | quite happy to
[47:59] me010 | uh
"[48:00] me010 | see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and"
"[48:04] me010 | um , how they might uh"
[48:07] me010 | get reflected in constructions .
[48:09] me045 | Sure .
[48:10] me010 | I suspect that 's right .
[48:10] me045 | Yeah . Yeah .
[48:14] mn036 | I I may have to go to Switzerland for in June or beginning of July for
"[48:19] mn036 | between two weeks and four weeks , but uh ,"
[48:22] mn036 | after that or before that .
"[48:23] me010 | OK , fine ."
"[48:24] me010 | And , um ,"
[48:27] me010 | if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or
"[48:33] me010 | at the German AI center ,"
[48:34] me010 | while you 're in in the neighborhood .
[48:35] mn036 | Right .
[48:36] mn036 | Yeah be uh actu actually
[48:38] mn036 | I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has
[48:41] me010 | Yeah . Yep .
"[48:44] mn036 | an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of ."
"[48:48] me010 | E o do y Well , we we 're connected to"
[48:49] mn036 | Yeah .
"[48:51] me010 | uh There 's a there 's a a very significant connection between We 'll we 'll go through this ,"
[48:57] mn036 | Yeah .
[49:04] me010 | Fr - Ge - Germany 's got two big
[49:07] me010 | technical institutes . There 's one in in
"[49:09] me010 | Zurich ,"
[49:10] mn036 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:11] me010 | E T H , and then there 's one , the French speaking one ,"
"[49:14] me010 | in Lausanne ,"
[49:16] me010 | OK ? which is uh E P F L .
"[49:16] me045 | Oh , so in Switzerland ."
[49:19] me010 | So find out who they are associated with in Geneva . Probably we 're connected to them .
[49:19] mn036 | Great .
[49:21] mn036 | Right .
[49:23] mn036 | Great . I 'll let you know .
[49:24] mn036 | S I 'll send you email .
[49:24] me010 | OK .
"[49:35] mn015 | Hmm . Uh . I I think the one you you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too ."
"[49:40] mn036 | Sure , yeah ."
"[49:44] me010 | Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up"
[49:45] mn036 | Yeah .
[49:48] mn036 | Right .
"[49:51] mn036 | Great , yeah ."
[49:52] me010 | these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone
[49:56] me010 | over the last decade in trying to build them .
[49:59] me010 | So we 'll set that up .
[50:00] mn036 | Cool .
"[50:03] me010 | OK . So ,"
"[50:06] me010 | uh , unless we wanna start"
[50:10] me010 | uh
[50:16] mn015 | I I tho It 's probably better if I come
[50:19] mn015 | next week with the
[50:22] mn015 | um
[50:24] mn015 | version O point nine
"[50:25] me010 | OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week"
[50:26] mn015 | of the structure .
[50:29] me010 | come up with something that
"[50:31] me010 | is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying "" here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand "" ."
[50:40] me010 | And that we as a group will try to to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .
[50:43] me012 | Sure .
"[50:47] me010 | OK ? Uh , "" these are the decisions "" I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information . It 's a design problem ."
[50:52] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[50:53] me012 | Yeah .
[50:55] me010 | And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like .
[51:00] me010 | And then finish it up . Does that so make sense ?
[51:00] me045 | OK .
[51:05] me045 | OK .
"[51:05] mn015 | And um , the the sem semester will be over"
[51:09] mn015 | next week but then you have projects
[51:11] mn015 | for one more week to come ?
"[51:13] me012 | No , I I think I 'll be done everything by this uh by the end of this week ."
[51:17] mn015 | Same with you ? No .
"[51:19] me003 | Nnn . This Well , I 've I have projects , but then the my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final"
[51:25] me003 | that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means
[51:29] me010 | Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ?
"[51:31] me003 | Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah ."
"[51:32] me010 | Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess ."
[51:33] me012 | Hmm .
[51:35] me010 | Right .
"[51:36] me010 | Um ,"
"[51:37] me010 | But anyway , yeah ."
"[51:40] me010 | OK , so I guess that 's"
[51:44] me010 | Right . right .
"[51:46] me010 | So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co these guys are talking ,"
"[51:51] me010 | uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of"
[51:58] me045 | OK .
"[51:59] me010 | Of course ,"
"[52:00] me010 | nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people , right ? So , um ,"
[52:02] mn015 | Mmm .
[52:05] me010 | two or three people is the size in which
[52:07] me010 | actual work gets done .
[52:10] me010 | So we 'll do that .
"[52:12] me010 | Great . Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with"
"[52:15] me010 | uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas"

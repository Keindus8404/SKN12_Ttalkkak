[00:18] mn007 | I don't know . Do you have news from the conference talk ?
"[00:21] mn007 | Uh , that was"
[00:23] fn002 | Yesterday
[00:26] mn007 | I guess .
[00:27] fn002 | Yesterday morning on video conference .
[00:31] mn007 | Well
[00:31] me006 | Oh . Conference call .
"[00:37] me018 | Oh , this was the , uh ,"
[00:42] fn002 | Yeah .
"[00:43] me013 | Yeah . No , that would have been a good thing to find out before this meeting , that 's . No , I have no I have no idea . Um ,"
"[00:51] me013 | Uh , so I mean , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead , because even if they"
[00:56] mn007 | Yeah .
"[00:58] me013 | tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in"
[01:06] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:10] mn007 | a little bit worked on trying to see ,"
"[01:17] mn007 | uh , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies . So ,"
"[01:22] mn007 | We took first we took the LDA filters and ,"
[01:30] mn007 | using uh recursive filters actually .
[01:36] mn007 | I 'm sorry ?
[01:36] me013 | Who is doing that ?
"[01:38] mn007 | Uh , us . Yeah ."
"[01:39] me013 | Oh , oh . Oh , OK ."
[01:45] mn007 | the FIR filters
"[01:50] mn007 | designed , uh , IIR filters that have the same frequency response ."
[01:56] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[01:57] mn007 | Well ,"
"[01:57] mn007 | similar , but that have shorter delays ."
[02:01] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:03] mn007 | So they had two filters , one for the low frequency bands and another for the high frequency bands ."
[02:08] mn007 | And so we redesigned two filters . And the low frequency band has
"[02:13] mn007 | sixty - four milliseconds of delay , and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the"
[02:22] mn007 | IIR filters .
[02:29] me013 | OK .
[02:32] me013 | You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ?
[02:35] mn007 | No .
[02:37] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[02:38] me013 | Yeah , you should talk with him ."
"[02:39] mn007 | Yeah , yeah ."
"[02:40] me013 | Yeah . No , I mean , because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination , right ? So so you need to"
[02:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:46] me013 | discuss with him what we 're doing , uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and or something ."
[02:48] mn007 | Yeah .
[02:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[02:57] me013 | Right .
[02:57] mn007 | They were trying to do something different like
"[03:00] mn007 | taking , uh well , using filter that takes only a past and"
"[03:05] mn007 | this is just a little bit different . But I will I will send him an email and tell him exactly what we are doing , so ."
"[03:13] mn007 | Um ,"
[03:19] me013 | we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication . So .
[03:25] me013 | OK .
[03:29] mn007 | Yeah .
"[03:30] mn007 | Well , there is w one , um ,"
"[03:34] mn007 | remark about these filters , that"
"[03:36] mn007 | they don't have a linear phase . So ,"
[03:39] me013 | Right .
"[03:53] mn007 | it 's , uh , computed on"
"[04:01] mn007 | mmm ,"
"[04:02] mn007 | well ,"
[04:02] mn007 | the most important for speech so .
"[04:06] mn007 | Uh , this is the first thing ."
[04:10] fn002 | The low f f
[04:14] mn007 | Yeah .
[04:17] me013 | What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ?
[04:19] mn007 | Three hundred and thirty .
"[04:23] mn007 | Yeah , but there are other points actually ,"
"[04:26] mn007 | uh , which will perhaps add some more delay . Is that"
[04:34] mn007 | um
"[04:36] mn007 | perf well , not very correct ,"
[04:38] mn007 | like the downsampling which w was simply dropping frames .
[04:41] me013 | Yeah .
"[04:42] mn007 | Um ,"
[04:43] mn007 | so we will try also to add a nice downsampling having a filter
[04:48] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[04:48] mn007 | that that well ,"
[04:49] mn007 | a low - pass filter at at twenty - five hertz .
"[04:53] mn007 | Uh , because wh when when we look at the LDA filters , well , they are basically low - pass but"
[04:58] mn007 | they
[04:59] mn007 | leave a lot of what 's above twenty - five hertz .
[05:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:03] mn007 | Um , and so , yeah , this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again ."
[05:09] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:09] mn007 | Um ,"
"[05:11] mn007 | yeah , and then there 's a third thing ,"
"[05:14] mn007 | is that ,"
"[05:16] mn007 | um ,"
[05:18] mn007 | basically the way
[05:20] mn007 | on - line normalization was done
"[05:22] mn007 | uh ,"
[05:23] mn007 | is just using this recursion
[05:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[05:26] mn007 | on on the um ,"
"[05:28] mn007 | um ,"
"[05:30] mn007 | on the feature stream ,"
"[05:31] mn007 | and but this is a filter , so it has also a delay ."
"[05:35] mn007 | Uh , and when we"
[05:40] me013 | Eighty - five .
[05:41] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:42] mn007 | If we want to be very
"[05:50] mn007 | well ,"
"[05:50] mn007 | the right estimation of the mean ,"
[05:52] mn007 | we have to t to take eighty - five milliseconds in the future .
[05:56] mn007 | Mmm .
[05:59] me013 | Hmm !
[06:00] me013 | That 's a little bit of a problem .
[06:02] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:05] mn007 | But , well , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright ."
"[06:10] mn007 | We would be at six so , sixty - five ,"
"[06:13] mn007 | plus ten , plus for the downsampling , plus eighty - five for the on - line normalization ."
[06:18] mn007 | So it 's
[06:20] mn007 | plus plus eighty for the neural net and PCA .
[06:23] me013 | Oh .
"[06:24] mn007 | So it would be around two hundred and forty so , well ,"
[06:28] me013 | Just just barely in there .
"[06:29] mn007 | plus plus the frames , but it 's OK ."
[06:31] me018 | What 's the allowable ?
[06:34] mn007 | Hmm .
[06:39] me018 | What were they thinking of changing it to ?
[06:39] mn007 | Yeah .
"[06:46] me013 | very very narrow , uh , latency bound . And the people who have longer latency don't . So ."
[06:52] me018 | Huh .
"[06:53] mn007 | So , yeah ."
[06:55] me018 | Ah !
"[06:57] mn007 | Yeah , and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency . So ."
[07:01] me013 | Yeah .
[07:03] mn007 | Well .
"[07:03] me013 | Yeah , so they were basically I mean ,"
"[07:06] me013 | they were more or less trading computation for performance and we were ,"
"[07:11] me013 | uh , trading latency for performance . And"
"[07:14] me013 | they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't , and"
"[07:17] me013 | so I think of it as complementary ,"
[07:20] me018 | Think of it as what ?
[07:21] me013 | Complementary .
[07:22] me018 | Hmm .
"[07:24] me013 | so , uh , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just"
"[07:28] me013 | adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system , which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years ."
"[07:34] me013 | Uh , which is we say , well this is the way we should do it . And then we do it . And then"
[07:39] me013 | someone else
"[07:41] me013 | does something that 's straight forward . So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise and we did we adde"
[07:47] me013 | did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise .
[07:51] me018 | Right .
"[07:51] me013 | We just , uh , you know , trained up systems"
[07:54] me013 | to be more discriminant .
"[07:55] me013 | And , uh , we did this , uh , RASTA - like filtering which"
[07:59] me013 | was done in the log domain and was tending to handle convolutional noise . We did we actually did nothing about additive noise .
"[08:07] me013 | So , um ,"
"[08:09] me013 | the , uh , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job . And so , uh ,"
[08:17] me013 | we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff . I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than
[08:23] me013 | both but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to
[08:28] me013 | get rid of most of that latency . To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing .
[08:40] me013 | you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server
"[08:44] me013 | and , uh , having a a a quarter second"
[08:48] me013 | for some processing to clean it up . It doesn't seem like it 's that
[08:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:52] me013 | big a deal . These aren't large vocabulary things so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and ."
[08:57] me013 | So .
[08:58] me018 | And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency .
"[09:09] me013 | the the surgical , uh ,"
"[09:13] me013 | uh , microscopes and so forth . Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh ,"
"[09:22] me013 | finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ?"
"[09:27] me018 | Um , we had a silence detector , so"
[09:30] me018 | we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector .
[09:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:35] me018 | And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many
[09:39] me018 | frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be
[09:41] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[09:43] me018 | the end of an utterance . Um ,"
"[09:46] me018 | but it was , uh ,"
[09:48] me018 | I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds .
"[09:51] me013 | Yeah , and that 's when you 'd start"
[09:53] me013 | doing things .
"[09:55] me018 | Yeah , we did the back trace at that point to get the answer ."
[09:56] me013 | Yeah .
[09:58] me013 | Of course that didn't take too long at that point . Yeah .
"[09:59] me018 | No , no it was pretty quick ."
"[10:00] me013 | Yeah , so you you so you had a"
"[10:02] me013 | so you had a a quarter second delay before , uh ,"
[10:02] me018 | this w
"[10:07] me013 | plus some little processing time , and then"
[10:09] me018 | Right .
[10:11] me013 | the the microscope would start moving or something .
[10:14] me013 | Yeah .
[10:26] me018 | th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay .
"[10:29] me013 | Yeah , so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something . Uh , I 'm not an expert on that but ."
[10:32] me018 | Yeah .
[10:34] me018 | Yeah .
[10:35] me018 | I don't remember the exact numbers but
[10:37] me013 | Yeah .
[10:38] me018 | it was something like that .
[10:40] me018 | I don't think you can really tell .
"[10:41] me018 | A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between ,"
[10:50] me013 | Yeah .
[10:50] me018 | I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .
[10:53] me013 | Yeah .
[10:53] me018 | I mean it just it feels so quick .
"[10:56] me013 | I mean , basically if you yeah , if you"
"[10:59] me013 | said , uh , um ,"
"[11:01] me013 | "" what 's the , uh , uh what 's the shortest route to the opera ? """
"[11:06] me013 | and it took half a second to get back to you , I mean , it would be f I mean , it might even be too abrupt . You might have to put in a s a s a delay . Yeah ."
[11:09] me018 | Yeah .
[11:13] me018 | Yeah .
"[11:15] me018 | I mean , it may feel different than talking to a person because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances ."
"[11:21] me018 | So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done ."
[11:21] me013 | Yeah .
[11:25] me018 | So it it would probably feel different but I don't think it would feel
[11:25] me013 | Right .
[11:29] me018 | slow .
[11:32] me013 | Right .
"[11:34] me013 | Well , anyway ,"
"[11:37] me013 | we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by by , uh ,"
"[11:42] me013 | playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . We t we talked about that ."
[11:46] me018 | So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ?
[11:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[11:51] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[11:52] me013 | And there 's also well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , uh , uh , multi - frame , uh , uh , KLT ."
"[12:02] me018 | Was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ?"
[12:06] me013 | They weren't looking ahead much .
[12:09] me013 | They p they looked ahead a little bit .
[12:10] me018 | A little bit . OK .
[12:12] me013 | Yeah .
"[12:14] me013 | Yeah , I mean , you could do this with a recurrent net . And and then But you also could just , um ,"
"[12:20] me013 | I mean , we haven't experimented with this but I imagine you could , um ,"
"[12:27] me013 | um , a label , uh , from more in the past than in than than in the future ."
"[12:35] me013 | I mean , we 've d we 've done some stuff with that before . I think it it works OK ."
[12:38] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[12:39] me013 | So .
"[12:42] me013 | Yeah , but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys . You can do it ."
[12:43] me018 | Yeah .
[12:48] me013 | So .
"[12:51] me013 | So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with , s messing around with this , yeah ."
"[12:56] me013 | And , uh ,"
"[13:02] fn002 | to , uh , apply the eh , spectral subtraction from Ericsson and to to change the contextual KLT for LDA ."
[13:04] mn007 | Yeah .
[13:06] me013 | Uh - huh .
[13:15] me018 | Change the what ?
[13:16] fn002 | The contextual KLT .
[13:19] me018 | I 'm missing that last word . Context -
[13:20] me006 | Oh . KLT .
"[13:21] fn002 | KLT KLT , I 'm sorry ."
"[13:21] me018 | KLT . Oh , KLT . Uh - huh ."
[13:22] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:24] fn002 | Uh , to change and use LDA discriminative ."
[13:29] mn007 | Yeah .
[13:30] me013 | Uh - huh .
[13:31] fn002 | I don't know .
"[13:34] me013 | Uh ,"
[13:35] me018 | What is the advantage of that ?
"[13:38] mn007 | Well , it 's that by the for the moment we have , uh , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear ."
"[13:43] mn007 | And the other is linear but it 's not discriminant at all . Well , it 's"
[13:51] me013 | So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from
"[13:56] me013 | just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative ,"
[14:00] me013 | what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you .
[14:02] me013 | Just to understand it a little better I guess .
[14:05] mn007 | Mmm .
[14:06] mn007 | Well uh yeah .
"[14:10] mn007 | Actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also ."
[14:18] mn007 | And to see if it if it improves ov over over the non - discriminant linear transformation .
"[14:24] mn007 | And if the neural net is better than this or , well ."
[14:24] me018 | Hmm .
[14:30] me013 | whether it having the neural net really buys you anything .
[14:30] mn007 | Mmm .
"[14:33] me013 | Uh , I mean , it doe did look like it buys you something over just the KLT ."
[14:37] mn007 | Yeah .
"[14:37] me013 | But maybe it 's just the discrimination and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary ."
[14:40] fn002 | S maybe .
[14:43] mn007 | Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[14:43] fn002 | Maybe .
[14:43] me013 | Could be .
[14:44] me013 | Good good to know .
[14:49] mn007 | Yeah .
[14:57] fn002 | We was think
"[14:58] mn007 | on on the mel frequency bands , so . Yeah , be before everything ."
"[14:59] fn002 | Yeah , we no nnn"
"[14:59] me013 | OK , so just do that on the mel f"
[15:01] fn002 | We we was thinking to do before after VAD or
[15:12] fn002 | and then
[15:12] me013 | So so you know that that that the way that
[15:13] mn007 | Um .
"[15:15] me013 | they 're uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing ,"
"[15:22] me013 | was having a third party , um ,"
"[15:26] me013 | run a good VAD ,"
[15:29] me013 | and and determine boundaries .
[15:32] fn002 | Yeah .
"[15:33] me013 | And then given those boundaries ,"
[15:35] fn002 | Begin to work .
[15:35] me013 | then have everybody do the recognition .
"[15:42] me013 | if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't ,"
"[15:47] me013 | uh , or one had a better VAD than the other"
[15:50] me013 | since that they 're not viewing that as being
"[15:53] me013 | part of the the task ,"
[15:55] me013 | and that any any manufacturer would
[15:58] me013 | put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection .
"[16:02] me013 | It still wouldn't be perfect but I mean ,"
"[16:03] me013 | e the argument was "" let 's not have that be part of this test . """
"[16:07] me013 | "" Let 's let 's separate that out . """
"[16:12] me013 | uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday and ,"
"[16:14] me013 | yeah , I 'm sorry , I don't don't know the answer but we should find out . I 'm sure we 'll find out soon"
"[16:18] me013 | what they , uh what they decided ."
"[16:23] me013 | So , uh Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD but otherwise it 's it 's on the the , uh the mel fil filter bank , uh ,"
[16:30] me013 | energies I guess ? You do doing the ?
[16:30] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:31] mn007 | Mmm , yeah ."
[16:32] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:36] me013 | I guess it 's power power domain ,"
"[16:38] me013 | uh , or or magnitude domain . Probably power domain , right ?"
[16:42] me013 | why
"[16:42] mn007 | I guess it 's power domain , yeah . I don't remember exactly ."
[16:44] fn002 | I don't remember .
"[16:45] me013 | Yeah , yep ."
[16:52] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:55] mn007 | Mmm .
[17:02] mn007 | Yeah .
[17:18] me018 | Really ? Huh !
[17:18] mn007 | Yeah .
[17:20] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:21] mn007 | And generated this this , um ,"
[17:21] me013 | Uh .
"[17:24] mn007 | so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise ,"
[17:28] mn007 | and you multiply this by a factor which is depend dependent on the SNR .
"[17:33] fn002 | Hmm , maybe ."
[17:33] mn007 | So . Well .
[17:35] me018 | Hmm !
"[17:35] mn007 | When the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level ,"
"[17:41] mn007 | the coefficient is small , and around one ."
[17:44] mn007 | But when the power le the s signal level is
"[17:49] mn007 | uh small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important ."
"[17:54] mn007 | And this reduce actually the music musical noise , uh"
[17:57] me018 | Oh !
"[17:58] mn007 | which is more important during silence portions , when"
[18:01] me018 | Uh - huh .
[18:01] mn007 | the s the energy 's small .
[18:03] me018 | Hmm !
"[18:03] mn007 | So there are tricks like this but , mmm ."
[18:05] me018 | Hmm !
[18:06] me013 | Yeah .
[18:08] me013 | So .
[18:11] me018 | Is the estimate of the noise spectrum a running estimate ?
[18:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:16] me013 | Yeah .
[18:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[18:25] me018 | Hmm !
"[18:26] me013 | if you have , uh , fair assurance that , uh ,"
"[18:30] me013 | the noise is is quite stationary ,"
[18:33] me013 | then the smartest thing to do is use as much
"[18:36] me013 | data as possible to estimate the noise , get a much better estimate , and subtract it off ."
[18:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:41] me013 | But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to"
"[18:47] me013 | do it on - line , uh , with some forgetting factor or something ."
[18:51] me018 | So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ?
"[18:59] me013 | Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum . So one of the things"
"[19:11] me013 | was to , uh , take some period of of of speech"
"[19:16] me013 | and in each band , uh , develop a histogram ."
"[19:20] me013 | So , to get a decent histogram of these energies"
"[19:24] me013 | takes at least a few seconds really . But , uh I mean you can do it with a smaller amount but it 's pretty rough ."
"[19:31] me013 | And , um , in fact I think the NIST"
[19:34] me013 | standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .
[19:38] me018 | A couple seconds ?
"[19:39] me013 | No , no , it 's based on this kind of method , this histogram method . So you have a histogram ."
[19:41] me018 | Hmm .
"[19:44] me013 | Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps"
"[19:48] me013 | in the histogram , which you could approximate as two Gaussians ."
[19:52] me018 | But wh don't they overlap sometimes ?
"[19:54] me013 | Oh , yeah ."
[19:55] me018 | OK .
[19:55] me013 | So you have a mixture of two Gaussians .
[19:57] me018 | Yeah .
"[19:58] me013 | Right ? And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know . So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you you n know what they are , and , uh I mean , sorry , you estimate what they are ,"
[19:59] me018 | Yeah .
"[20:06] me013 | and , uh , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is"
[20:11] me013 | in that band in the spectrum . And then you look over the whole thing and now you have a noise spectrum .
"[20:16] me013 | So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method . And the other thing to do"
"[20:21] me013 | is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , uh ,"
"[20:25] me013 | uh , determine through magical means that that , uh , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is ."
[20:30] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:31] me013 | Uh , but ,"
"[20:33] me013 | you know , it 's that that that 's"
"[20:35] me013 | tricky to do . It has mistakes . Uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable ."
"[20:42] me013 | Uh , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio"
"[20:47] me013 | is to just , uh you can do a w a uh an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only . I guess it is EM still , but just just determine the means only ."
"[20:57] me013 | Don't worry about the variances . And then you just use those mean values as being the the , uh"
[20:58] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[21:03] me013 | uh
[21:05] me013 | signal - to - noise ratio in that band .
[21:10] me018 | it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency .
"[21:14] me018 | I mean , depending on"
[21:15] me018 | where the window was that you used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio .
"[21:20] mn007 | Yeah , sure ."
[21:22] mn007 | Mmm .
"[21:25] me018 | OK , well that I guess that was my question , yeah ."
[21:36] me013 | It 's an interesting question . I wonder how they did
[21:38] me013 | do it ?
"[21:39] mn007 | If - if you want to have a good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future . I mean ,"
"[21:45] mn007 | if you take your window and build your histogram in this window ,"
[21:56] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:56] me013 | Well , yeah , but what does what what what does Alcatel do ? And and France Telecom ."
[22:00] mn007 | The -
"[22:01] mn007 | They just look in the past . I guess it works because the noise are , uh"
"[22:05] mn007 | pret uh , almost stationary but ,"
[22:05] me013 | Pretty stationary .
"[22:06] me006 | Pretty stationary , yeah ."
"[22:07] me013 | Well , the thing , e e e e"
"[22:15] mn007 | Well , if y if you have a good estimation of the noise , yeah , because well it it has to work . i"
[22:20] me013 | But it 's hard to but that 's hard to do .
"[22:21] mn007 | Yeah , that 's hard to do . Yeah ."
[22:25] me013 | wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise .
[22:30] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:32] me013 | That 's what spectral subtraction will help with , practically speaking ."
[22:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[22:35] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:35] me013 | If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech , even if it 's centered ,"
"[22:42] me013 | right ? if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds ,"
[22:43] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:48] me013 | then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem . I mean , imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum , right ?"
[22:49] mn007 | Yeah .
[22:51] mn007 | Mmm .
[22:55] me013 | So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz .
[23:02] me013 | Yeah .
"[23:03] mn007 | But I think y um ,"
[23:06] mn007 | Hirsch does experiment with windows of
[23:09] mn007 | like between five hundred milliseconds and one second . And
"[23:15] mn007 | well , five hundred wa was not so bad . I mean"
"[23:18] mn007 | and he worked on non - stationary noises , like noise modulated with"
"[23:24] mn007 | well , wi with amplitude modulations and"
"[23:33] mn007 | Um ,"
"[23:42] mn007 | you you have to center the window , yeah ."
[23:43] me013 | Yeah .
[23:44] mn007 | Mmm .
"[23:45] me013 | No , I understand it 's better to do but I just think that that , uh ,"
[23:47] mn007 | Mmm .
[23:56] mn007 | Yeah .
"[23:59] me013 | I mean , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods , uh , uh , but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh ,"
[24:03] mn007 | Hmm .
[24:12] mn007 | Yeah .
"[24:14] me018 | We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files ,"
[24:18] me018 | and built the averages from them .
[24:18] me013 | Yeah .
[24:27] mn007 | But if the if the noise is stationary
[24:28] me013 | Yeah .
[24:30] me013 | Yeah .
[24:31] mn007 | perhaps you don't even need some kind of noise estimation algorithm . We just take th th
[24:35] mn007 | th the beginning of the utterance and
"[24:39] me013 | Oh , yeah , sure ."
[24:40] fn002 | It 's the same .
"[24:40] mn007 | I I know p I don't know if people tried this for Aurora . Well , everybody seems to use some kind of adaptive , well ,"
[24:47] fn002 | Yeah .
"[24:48] mn007 | scheme but ,"
[24:48] fn002 | A dictionary .
[24:49] mn007 | is it very useful and is the c
[24:50] me018 | Very slow adaptation .
"[24:52] me013 | Right , the word "" stationary "" is has a very precise statistical meaning . But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly ,"
"[25:01] me013 | uh , compared with our our processing techniques . So"
[25:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:05] me013 | if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time
"[25:09] me013 | the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly . It 's not gonna stay absolute the same . If you if you check it out ,"
"[25:16] me013 | uh , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road or"
[25:19] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:19] me013 | whatever . But it 's it 's i i i
[25:22] me013 | using the local
"[25:24] me013 | characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well ."
[25:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[25:33] mn007 | Yeah .
"[25:41] me013 | but but , uh , I don't know ."
"[25:56] me013 | uh , we 're already having problems with these delay , uh delay issues . So , uh , we 'll have to figure ways without it ."
"[26:05] me013 | Um ,"
"[26:08] me018 | If they 're going to provide a ,"
"[26:11] me018 | uh , voice activity detector"
"[26:14] me018 | that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then ,"
[26:18] me018 | couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ?
"[26:21] me013 | Oh , yeah ."
[26:24] me013 | You bet .
"[26:34] mn007 | Yeah , they have some kind of threshold on on the previous estimate , and So ."
[26:35] me013 | @ @
[26:40] mn007 | Yeah .
"[26:42] mn007 | I think . Yeah , I think"
"[26:44] mn007 | Ericsson used this kind of threshold . Yeah , so , they h they have an estimate of the noise level"
"[26:49] mn007 | and they put a threshold like six or ten DB above ,"
[26:52] mn007 | and
[26:54] mn007 | what 's under this threshold is used to update the estimate .
[26:58] fn002 | Yeah .
[26:59] fn002 | I think so .
[27:01] fn002 | I have not here the proposal .
[27:01] mn007 | So it 's it 's Yeah .
[27:05] me006 | Hmm .
[27:06] me013 | Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ?
"[27:11] mn007 | Y you know , perhaps ?"
[27:13] fn002 | No .
[27:18] me013 | OK .
"[27:25] me013 | OK , if we 're we 're done done with that , uh ,"
"[27:29] me013 | let 's see . Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly , just , uh , things that that we 've been"
"[27:35] me013 | chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet . So you 're coming up with your quals proposal , and , uh Wanna just"
[27:45] me013 | give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ?
"[27:48] me006 | Oh , um ,"
"[27:51] me006 | two , three , it can be shorter than that . Um ."
"[27:55] me006 | I 've talked to some of you already . Um , but I 'm , uh , looking into extending the work done by Larry Saul and John Allen and uh Mazin Rahim ."
"[28:06] me006 | Um , they they have a system that 's , uh , a multi - band , um , system but their multi - band"
"[28:13] me006 | is is a little different than the way that we 've been doing multi - band in the past , where"
[28:18] me006 | um Where we 've been
"[28:23] me006 | sub - band features and i training up these neural nets and on on phonetic targets , and then combining them some somehow down the line ,"
"[28:31] me006 | um ,"
"[28:32] me006 | they 're they 're taking sub - band features and , um ,"
"[28:37] me006 | training up a detector that detects for , um ,"
[28:41] me006 | these phonetic features
"[28:43] me006 | for example , um , he presents um ,"
"[28:46] me006 | uh , a detector to detect sonorance ."
"[28:54] me006 | at the lowest level , there it 's it 's an OR ga I mean , it 's an AND gate . So , uh , on each sub - band you have several"
"[29:02] me006 | independent tests ,"
[29:03] me006 | to test whether
"[29:05] me006 | um , there 's the existence of sonorance in a sub - band ."
"[29:08] me006 | And then , um , it c it 's combined by a soft AND gate ."
"[29:12] me006 | And at the at the higher level ,"
"[29:14] me006 | for every if , um The higher level there 's a soft OR gate ."
"[29:20] me006 | Uh , so if if this detector detects"
"[29:23] me006 | um , the presence of of sonorance in any of the sub - bands , then the detect uh , the OR gate at the top says , "" OK , well this frame"
[29:35] me018 | What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ?
"[29:43] me006 | Um , and the , uh the one o"
"[29:46] me013 | So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network . So that 's all it is . It 's a sig it 's a sigmoid ,"
[29:52] me006 | Yeah .
"[29:54] me013 | uh , with weighted sum at the input ,"
[29:56] me018 | Hmm .
[29:56] me006 | Right .
[29:57] me013 | which you train by gradient descent .
[30:02] me006 | to um train up these um parameters for the logistic regression .
"[30:07] me013 | Well , actually , yeah , so I was using EM to get the targets ."
"[30:12] me013 | So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output ."
"[30:19] me013 | And then he uses , uh , i u and then feeding into that are I 'm sorry , there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ? Yeah , so that 's the product . And then , um ,"
[30:25] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:29] me013 | then he has each of these AND things . And , um ,"
[30:34] me013 | but so they 're little neural neural units .
"[30:38] me013 | Um , and , um , they have to have targets . And so the targets come from EM ."
[30:58] me018 | What what what are they looking at ? What are their inputs ?
"[31:06] me006 | there are basically , uh , several measures of SNR and and correlation ."
"[31:12] me018 | Ah , OK , OK ."
"[31:13] me006 | Um , um and he said there 's like twenty of these per per sub - band ."
"[31:17] me006 | Um ,"
"[31:19] me006 | and for for every s every sub - band ,"
[31:22] me006 | e you you just
"[31:26] me006 | i independent logistic tests . """
[31:29] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:29] me006 | And you initialize these parameters ,"
"[31:32] me006 | um , in some some way"
[31:34] me006 | and use EM
[31:36] me006 | to come up with your training targets for a for the the low - level detectors .
[31:40] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:44] me006 | whole thing on maximum likelihood . Um ,"
[31:48] me006 | and h he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is
[31:59] me006 | Gaussian mixtures um estimations of of sonorance .
[32:02] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:06] me006 | so that 's just that 's just one detector . So you can imagine
"[32:10] me006 | building many of these detectors on different features . You get enough of these detectors together ,"
"[32:14] me006 | um , then you have enough information to do , um , higher level discrimination , for example , discriminating between phones"
[32:22] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[32:23] me006 | and then you keep working your way up until you you build a full recognizer .
[32:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:27] me006 | So , um , that 's that 's the direction"
[32:31] me006 | which I 'm I 'm thinking about going in my quals .
[32:33] me018 | Cool .
"[32:35] me013 | You know , it has a number of properties that I really liked . I mean , one is the going towards , um ,"
"[32:41] me013 | using narrow band information for , uh , ph phonetic features of some sort rather than just , uh ,"
[32:49] me013 | immediately going for the the typical sound units .
[32:52] me018 | Right .
"[32:58] me013 | explicitly trained for a product of errors rule ,"
"[33:01] me013 | which is what , uh , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties ,"
[33:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:07] me013 | uh , for people listening to narrow band stuff . That 's Friday 's talk , by the way ."
"[33:11] me013 | And then , um ,"
"[33:14] me013 | Uh , the third thing I like about it is ,"
"[33:26] me013 | um , this issue of where the targets come from ."
"[33:29] me013 | So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands"
"[33:41] me013 | for the sound there and we say , "" OK , we train every "" What this is saying is , OK , that 's maybe what our ultimate goal is or not ultimate but"
[33:42] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:49] me013 | penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units . But but , um ,"
"[33:59] me013 | uh , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?"
"[34:03] me013 | I mean , because , uh , we don't know"
"[34:15] me013 | where it was sonorant or not ? """
[34:16] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:16] me013 | But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide ,"
[34:28] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:31] me013 | uh , i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination . So , um , um , we don't really know how those should be labeled ."
"[34:42] me013 | It could sh be that you should ,"
"[34:45] me013 | um ,"
"[34:46] me013 | not be paying that much attention to , uh , certain bands for certain sounds , uh , in order to get the"
[34:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:52] me013 | best result . So , um , what we have been doing"
"[34:57] me013 | there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that . We trained these things up on the on the , uh the final label . Now we have"
"[35:06] me013 | I guess done experiments you 've probably done stuff where you have ,"
[35:13] me006 | Yeah . Forced alignment on the sub - band labels ? Yeah .
[35:16] me013 | Yeah .
[35:18] me013 | You 've done that . Did did that help at all ?
"[35:20] me006 | Um , it helps for one or t one iteration but"
"[35:24] me006 | um , anything after that"
[35:26] me006 | it doesn't help .
"[35:27] me013 | So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful because in a sense that 's the same sort of thing . You 're taking global information and determining what you how you should But this is this is , uh , I th I think a little more direct ."
[35:41] me018 | How did they measure the performance of their detector ?
"[35:44] me013 | Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , uh , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant ."
[35:50] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:55] me013 | And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um ,"
"[36:00] me013 | the , uh , uh he he did a comparison to , uh ,"
"[36:04] me013 | you know , our old foil , the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth ."
"[36:12] me013 | And , um , it didn't do nearly as well , especially in in noise ."
"[36:17] me013 | But the one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that . I mean ,"
"[36:23] me013 | this use of a very smooth , uh , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition"
[36:51] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:55] me013 | if you knew you were doing that , if you were doing something say for a a , uh a a Vocoder ,"
[37:01] me013 | you wouldn't use the same kind of features . You would use something that was sensitive to the periodicity and and not just the envelope .
"[37:08] me013 | Uh , and so in that sense it was an unfair test . Um ,"
"[37:12] me013 | so I think that the questioner was right . It it was in that sense an unfair test . Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because ,"
"[37:19] me013 | uh , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition , these smooth envelopes . And"
"[37:24] me013 | this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with ,"
"[37:30] me013 | you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , uh , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not . Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent ."
[37:43] me018 | Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment
"[37:46] me018 | where they said "" if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve"
[37:53] me018 | speech recognition ?
[37:55] me018 | I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that .
[37:58] me013 | The - these same people ? I don't remember that .
[37:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[38:01] me018 | Hmm .
"[38:01] me013 | That would that 's you 're right , that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is suppose you did that , uh , got that right . Um ,"
[38:11] me013 | Yeah .
[38:12] me018 | Hmm .
"[38:17] mn007 | Other kind of features , or ? in addition to detecting sonorants or ?"
[38:24] mn007 | Th - that 's what you want to to to go for also or ?
[38:27] me006 | What t
"[38:28] me006 | Oh , build other other detectors on different phonetic features ? Um ,"
[38:29] mn007 | Other low level detectors ?

"[38:45] me006 | e Um ,"
"[38:47] me006 | um ,"

"[38:54] me006 | Um ,"
[38:55] me018 | When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w

"[39:00] me018 | like frication ,"
[39:01] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:01] me018 | abrupt closure ,"
[39:03] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:08] me013 | Yeah , so there 's a half dozen like that that are Now this was coming at it from a different angle but maybe it 's a good"
[39:08] me018 | Uh .
"[39:08] me006 | Yeah , nasality ."
"[39:13] me013 | way to start . Uh , these are things which , uh ,"
"[39:16] me013 | John felt that a a , uh a human annotator"
[39:20] me013 | would be able to reliably mark .
"[39:22] me006 | Oh , OK ."
[39:22] me013 | So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark
[39:27] me013 | would be tongue position kinds of things . Yeah .
"[39:28] me006 | Placing stuff , yeah ."
[39:29] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[39:31] me018 | There 's also things like stress .
[39:34] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[39:35] me013 | But stress
"[39:37] me013 | doesn't , uh ,"
[39:50] me018 | But that 's not very common in English . In other languages it 's more
"[39:55] me018 | uh , important ."
"[39:57] me013 | Well , yeah , but i either case you 'd write PERMIT , right ? So you 'd get the word right ."
"[40:02] me018 | No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words ."
"[40:08] me013 | Um ,"
"[40:11] me018 | The sequence , right ?"
[40:12] me018 | Yeah .
"[40:13] me018 | Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[40:15] me013 | Yeah .
[40:15] me018 | Right .
"[40:15] me018 | So where it could help is maybe at a higher level . Yeah . Understanding , yeah . Exactly ."
[40:17] me006 | Like a understanding application . Yeah .
[40:17] me013 | Right .
"[40:33] me006 | S so , um , Ohala 's going to help do these , uh transcriptions of the meeting data ?"
[40:34] me013 | So .
"[40:40] me018 | Uh , well I don't know . We d we sort of didn't get that far . Um , we just talked about some"
[40:47] me018 | possible features that could be marked
"[40:50] me018 | by humans and , um ,"
[40:51] me006 | Hmm .
[40:53] me018 | because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that .
[40:59] me006 | Hmm .
"[41:00] me013 | Yeah , I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time . But but , uh , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John and and , uh ,"
"[41:04] me018 | Yeah , right ."
"[41:11] me013 | and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think ."
[41:13] me018 | I 'm definitely interested in this
"[41:15] me018 | area , too , f uh , acoustic feature"
[41:17] me013 | Uh - huh .
[41:18] me006 | OK .
[41:18] me018 | stuff . So .
"[41:20] me013 | Yeah , I think it 's an interesting interesting way to go . Um ,"
[41:20] me006 | Cool .
"[41:24] me013 | I say it like "" said - int "" . I think it has a number of good things ."
"[41:27] me013 | Um ,"
"[41:29] me013 | so , uh , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what"
[41:33] me013 | we 've been talking about today and other days ?
[41:34] me026 | Ri -
"[41:36] me026 | Yeah , OK , so , um ,"
"[41:38] me026 | we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition , um , mainly , uh , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal . So , um ,"
"[41:49] me026 | one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one and , um ,"
"[41:57] me026 | there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG ."
"[42:04] me026 | And so we 're interested in , um ,"
"[42:06] me026 | comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches ."
[42:16] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:17] me026 | And , um ,"
[42:18] me026 | it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that .
[42:26] mn007 | can you give some more details on this or ? Does it use one microphone ?
[42:30] me026 | o
"[42:33] me026 | there was something that was done by , um ,"
"[42:37] me026 | a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , um ,"
[42:41] me013 | Avendano .
"[42:42] me026 | OK . Who , um ,"
[42:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:44] me026 | um , it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , um , de - convolution by filtering"
"[42:51] me026 | um , except he used a longer time window ,"
[42:53] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:53] me026 | like a second maybe . And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to , um"
"[43:02] me026 | um , I don't know what you call it the reverberation response ."
[43:05] me026 | I if you see wh if you see what I mean .
[43:07] me026 | The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long
[43:13] me026 | in the in the time domain for the um for the RASTA filtering to take care of it .
"[43:18] me026 | And , um ,"
[43:19] me026 | then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches
"[43:23] me026 | which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet but have just been tried for enhancement , which , um ,"
[43:28] me026 | have the assumption that
"[43:30] me026 | um , you can do LPC"
[43:33] me026 | um
[43:34] me026 | analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone and
"[43:54] me026 | and , um , feed that through the i"
"[43:57] me026 | um , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced ."
[44:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[44:03] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:05] me013 | There 's also this , uh , um ,"
"[44:07] me013 | uh , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing , so , uh"
"[44:13] me013 | we have , uh and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal and then there 's the distant microphone signal ."
"[44:20] me013 | And you could as a kind of baseline say , "" OK , given that we have both of these , uh , we should be able to do , uh , a cancellation . """
"[44:28] me013 | So that , uh , um ,"
"[44:31] me013 | we we , uh , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it ,"
"[44:40] me013 | uh , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation"
[44:45] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[44:45] me013 | through one method or another . Uh , that 's not a practical thing ,"
"[44:49] me013 | uh , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily , but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline ."
"[44:56] me013 | Uh , it still won't be perfect because there 's noise ."
"[44:59] me013 | Uh , but And then there are s uh , there are"
"[45:03] me013 | single microphone methods that I think people have done for , uh for this kind of de - reverberation . Do y do you know any"
[45:11] me013 | references to any ? Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad
"[45:14] mn007 | Uh ,"
"[45:17] mn007 | I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones ,"
[45:17] me013 | path on that . But .
"[45:29] mn007 | Well , there is the Avendano work ,"
[45:30] me013 | Right .
"[45:31] mn007 | but also trying to mmm ,"
[45:35] mn007 | trying to f t
[45:36] mn007 | find the de - convolution filter
[45:41] mn007 | not in the time domain but in the
[45:43] mn007 | uh
[45:44] mn007 | the stream of features uh I guess .
"[45:48] me013 | Yeah , OK ."
"[45:52] mn007 | So perhaps , yeah ,"
[45:58] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:20] mn007 | So , yeah ."
"[46:21] mn007 | Well , he did echo cancellation and he did some fancier things like , uh ,"
"[46:29] mn007 | uh , training different network on different reverberation conditions and then trying to find the best one , but . Well ."
[46:35] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:37] me013 | The oth the other thing , uh , that Dave was talking about earlier was , uh , uh , multiple mike things ,"
"[46:43] me013 | uh , where they 're all distant . So , um , I mean , there 's there 's all this work on arrays , but the other thing is , uh , what can we do that 's cleverer"
"[46:52] me013 | that can take some advantage of only two mikes , uh , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them , as we as we have over there ."
[46:59] me013 | An obstruction between them .
"[47:00] mn007 | Ah , yeah ."
[47:07] me013 | with two ears even though they 're not several feet apart .
[47:07] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:10] me013 | For
[47:14] me018 | That could help though .
[47:17] me013 | that 's what it 's for .
"[47:20] me013 | Yeah , it 's to separate the ears ."
[47:20] me018 | To separate the ears ?
"[47:24] me013 | Yeah . Uh , so ."
"[47:29] me013 | Anyway , O K . Uh , I think that 's that 's all we have this week . And , uh , I think it 's digit time ."
[47:32] me006 | Oh .
"[47:37] me018 | Actually the , um For some reason the digit forms are blank ."
[47:38] me013 | Yeah ?
[47:42] me013 | Oh !
"[47:44] me018 | Adam ran out of digits , uh , and didn't have time to regenerate any ."
"[47:46] me013 | Oh ! I guess it 's Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then , is there ?"
"[47:51] me006 | Oh , no ?"
"[47:56] me018 | Uh , yeah , I do need your names and and the time , and all that , cuz we put that into the "" key "" files . Um ."
"[47:57] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[48:00] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[48:02] me018 | But w
[48:03] me013 | OK .
"[48:04] me018 | That 's why we have the forms , uh , even if there are no digits ."
"[48:05] me013 | OK , yeah , I didn't notice this . I 'm sitting here and I was I was about to read them too . It 's a , uh , blank sheet of paper ."
[48:12] me018 | So I guess we 're we 're done .
"[48:14] me013 | Yeah , yeah , I 'll do my credit card number later . OK ."

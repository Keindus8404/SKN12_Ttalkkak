[00:00] mn007 | It 's not very significant .
[00:01] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[00:07] me026 | Channel three . Alright .
"[00:08] me013 | OK , did you solve speech recognition last week ?"
"[00:18] me018 | We did it again , Morgan ."
[00:19] me013 | Alright !
"[00:37] me013 | Actually , Hynek should be getting back in town shortly if he isn't already ."
[00:40] me018 | Is he gonna come here ?
"[00:45] me018 | So when you said "" in town "" , you mean Oregon ."
"[00:46] me013 | U u u u uh , I meant , you know , this end of the world , yeah , is really what I meant , uh , cuz he 's been in Europe ."
[00:54] me013 | So .
[01:05] me018 | I have something just fairly brief to report on .
[01:08] me013 | Mmm . Great !
"[01:14] me018 | uh , go away for the w well , that week ."
"[01:18] me018 | Um , so what I was started playing with was the th again , this is the HTK back - end . And , um ,"
"[01:26] me018 | I was curious because the way that they train up the models , they go through"
"[01:39] me018 | uh , I think it 's three iterations , and for the last three rounds e e"
[01:43] me018 | they do seven iterations of re - estimation in each of those three .
"[01:49] me018 | And so , you know , that 's part of what takes so long to train the the the back - end for this ."
"[02:08] me018 | The first one is three , then seven , seven , and seven ."
"[02:27] me018 | OK . So what happens is , um , at each one of these points ,"
[02:32] me013 | Yeah .
[02:34] me018 | you increase the number of Gaussians in the model .
"[02:40] me018 | And so , in the final one here , you end up with , uh for all of the the digit words , you end up with , uh , three mixtures per state ,"
[02:52] me013 | Yeah .
"[02:55] me018 | So I had done some experiments where I was I I want to play with the number of mixtures . But , um ,"
[03:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:02] me018 | uh , I wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iterations early on . And so ,"
[03:08] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:11] me018 | um , I I ran a couple of experiments where I reduced that to l to be three , two , two , uh , five , I think , and I got almost the exact same results ."
[03:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[03:33] fn002 | Good .
"[03:34] me018 | as opposed to wh what , sixteen hours or something like that ?"
[03:37] fn002 | Yeah . It depends .
[03:39] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:42] me018 | uh , even we don't do anything else , doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster ."
[03:52] fn002 | Yeah .
[04:01] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[04:01] fn002 | OK .
[04:10] mn007 | Yeah .
[04:16] mn007 | OK . Mm - hmm .
[04:17] me006 | Oh .
[04:19] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:19] me018 | um , but it 's so much faster ."
[04:21] me006 | Hmm .
[04:22] me018 | I it makes a big difference . So we could do a lot more experiments and throw a lot more stuff in there .
[04:25] fn002 | Yeah .
[04:26] me013 | That 's great .
[04:57] mn007 | Yeah .
"[05:07] me018 | you have to make sure that in your dot CSHRC , um ,"
[05:11] me018 | it detects whether you 're running on the Linux or a a Sparc and points to the right executables .
"[05:16] me018 | Uh , and you may not have had that in your dot CSHRC before , if you were always just running the Sparc . So , um ,"
[05:28] me006 | Hmm . Cool .
"[05:31] me018 | together with the fact that we 've got these faster Linux boxes and that it takes less time to do these , um , we should be able to crank through a lot more experiments ."
[05:41] me006 | Hmm .
[05:48] me018 | see how how that affects performance .
[05:50] mn007 | Yeah .
[05:58] me018 | Mm - hmm . Exactly .
[05:58] me013 | that had more . Yeah .
[06:00] me018 | Right . Right .
"[06:02] me006 | So at at the middle o where the arrows are showing ,"
[06:05] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[06:05] me006 | that 's you 're adding one more mixture per state , or ?"
"[06:14] me018 | this uh , try to go it backwards this at this point it 's"
[06:17] me018 | two mixtures per state .
[06:26] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:27] me018 | mixtures per state .
[06:29] me006 | OK .
[06:40] me018 | Yeah . I think that 's what it is .
"[06:46] me018 | Shoot . I I I can't remember now what happens at that first one . Uh , I have to look it up and see ."
"[06:49] me006 | Oh , OK ."
[07:05] me006 | OK .
"[07:25] mn007 | I don't know yet the what happened Tuesday , but"
"[07:31] mn007 | the points that they were supposed to discuss is still ,"
[07:42] mn007 | Yeah . Yeah .
[07:44] mn007 | Mmm .
"[07:51] mn007 | I have no idea . Mmm , I just Yeah ."
"[07:52] me013 | Oh , you don't know . OK ."
[07:54] me013 | Alright .
"[07:56] mn007 | Um , yeah ."
[07:58] mn007 | So the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates
[08:04] mn007 | that are obtained from different language and and conditions .
"[08:07] mn007 | Um , it 's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting . Right now it 's a weighting on on improvement ."
[08:15] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[08:15] mn007 | Some people are arguing that it would be better to have weights on
"[08:25] mn007 | Uh , and the fact is that for right now for the English , they have weights they they combine error rates , but for the other languages they combine improvement ."
[08:36] mn007 | So it 's not very consistent .
[08:37] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[08:49] mn007 | uh , that happens with the current weight is that a very non - significant improvement on the well - matched case result in huge differences in in the final number ."
[09:02] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[09:02] me018 | Hmm .
"[09:02] mn007 | And so , perhaps they will"
"[09:17] me013 | Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake . But the but , um , the other thing I don't know I haven't thought it through , but one one would think that"
[09:21] mn007 | In -
"[09:26] me013 | each It it 's like if you say what 's the what 's the best way to do an average , an arithmetic average or a geometric average ?"
[09:32] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[09:33] me013 | It depends what you wanna show .
[09:45] mn007 | Tha - that 's what they do . Yeah .
"[09:45] me013 | Well , they are doing that ."
"[09:47] me013 | No , that is relative ."
"[09:49] me013 | But the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?"
[09:51] mn007 | Yeah .
[09:57] me013 | And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .
[09:59] me018 | Oh .
[10:01] me013 | It 's a weighted average .
"[10:12] mn007 | importance to the well - matched case because the baseline is already very good and ,"
[10:32] mn007 | Yeah .
[10:40] me013 | you should be significantly better than the previous standard .
[10:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:45] me013 | And , um , so they said "" how much is significantly better ? what do you ? "" And and so they said "" well ,"
[10:52] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[10:53] mn007 | Yeah .
"[10:53] me013 | So it 's , uh ,"
[10:56] me018 | Hmm .
[10:57] me013 | But it does seem like
[11:03] mn007 | Combine error rates and then Yeah .
[11:04] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[11:07] mn007 | But there is this this is this still this problem of weights . When when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult cases ,"
"[11:15] me013 | Oh , yeah ?"
"[11:17] mn007 | well , they have different , um , opinions about this ."
"[11:24] mn007 | to have ten percent imp relative improvement on well - matched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched ,"
[11:31] mn007 | and other people think that it 's more important to
"[11:44] me013 | that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases ,"
"[11:49] me013 | um , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use ,"
[11:54] me013 | none of this would be good enough . Nothing anybody 's whereas you sort of
[11:56] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[11:56] mn007 | Yeah .
[11:59] me013 | with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these these systems working .
[12:15] me013 | reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions . Um .
"[12:38] me013 | it isn't the operating theater . I mean , they don they they don't they don't really know , I think ."
[12:40] me018 | Yeah .
"[12:44] me013 | I mean , I th"
"[12:48] me018 | Uh ,"
[12:57] me018 | Yeah . Right .
[13:11] me018 | So not try to combine them .
"[13:12] me013 | Yeah . Uh , actually it 's true . Uh , I had forgotten this , uh , but , uh , well - matched is not actually clean . What it is is just that ,"
[13:13] me018 | Yeah .
"[13:27] me013 | uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could ,"
[13:30] me018 | Yeah .
"[13:47] me018 | you know , really small ."
[13:48] me013 | No . That 's a that 's a that 's an arg
"[13:49] me018 | I mean , that 's more of an information kind of thing ."
[13:54] me018 | Uh - huh .
[14:06] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:09] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:14] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[14:15] me006 | Uh - huh .
"[14:15] me013 | You know , so , I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case ,"
"[14:24] me013 | um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance . Right ?"
[14:29] me013 | And and y you wouldn't like that to be the case .
"[14:36] me018 | Well , that 'll teach them to roll their window up ."
"[14:50] me013 | it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation , and and and it 's a really big"
[14:55] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[14:57] me013 | performance drop . You know , so ,"
"[15:08] me013 | uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched and eighteen for the medium - matched and sixty for the for highly - mismatched ."
"[15:34] me013 | So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all ,"
"[15:38] me013 | that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance ,"
"[15:45] me013 | you know , with again gentle degregra degradation ,"
"[15:47] me013 | um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training ."
[15:52] me018 | Hmm .
"[15:53] me013 | So , you know , I I could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch , which is you know not"
"[15:58] me013 | compl pathological but I mean , what was the the medium - mismatch condition again ?"
"[16:03] mn007 | Um , it 's Yeah . Medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone , but trained on , like ,"
"[16:23] me013 | Right . So it 's still the same same microphone in both cases ,"
"[16:31] me013 | uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic"
[16:34] me018 | Yeah .
[16:45] mn007 | Yeah .
[16:46] me013 | And so then the that that makes the highly - matched the really big thing .
[16:50] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:51] me013 | Um ,"
[16:57] me013 | is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those .
"[17:08] me013 | m the , uh this other m medium if this happens , in the highly - mismatched that happens "" ."
"[17:14] me013 | And , uh , you should see ,"
"[17:18] me013 | uh , a gentle degradation through that ."
[17:21] me013 | Um .
[17:32] me013 | I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything
"[17:47] mn007 | Uh , so Yeah ."
"[17:49] mn007 | Yeah , but there is probably a a big change that will be made is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline , perhaps ,"
"[17:58] mn007 | which is , um , MFCC but with a voice activity detector ."
"[18:03] mn007 | And apparently ,"
[18:09] mn007 | still keep this fifty percent
"[18:12] mn007 | number . So they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline ,"
[18:17] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[18:20] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:21] mn007 | And if we look at the result that Sunil sent ,"
"[18:29] mn007 | which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like ,"
"[18:37] me013 | So nobody would be there , probably . Right ?"
[18:41] me013 | Good .
[18:41] mn007 | Yeah .
[19:09] me013 | but it 's just that it it it does seem to be
"[19:12] me013 | i uh ,"
"[19:14] me013 | a lot of work to do a good job on on that and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design , so"
[19:20] mn007 | Yeah .
[19:22] mn007 | Yeah .
[19:23] me013 | if we can cut down on that maybe we can make some progress .
[19:24] mn007 | M
[19:26] mn007 | Yeah .
"[19:34] mn007 | Uh , yeah . Per - e s s someone told that perhaps it 's not fair to do that because"
[19:52] mn007 | you need more features .
[19:55] mn007 | So you really need to put more more in the in in the front - end .
[20:02] mn007 | So i
[20:04] mn007 | S
[20:08] mn007 | Yeah .
"[20:12] me013 | Well , let 's say for ins see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch ."
[20:18] me013 | So just just for example .
[20:19] me013 | So suppose you 've that
[20:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[20:25] me013 | if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a in a in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech ."
[20:31] me018 | So there 's this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the MFCC ?
"[20:36] mn007 | That 's not clear , but this e"
"[20:38] me013 | Well , for the baseline ."
[20:39] me018 | Yeah .
[20:48] me018 | I don't s
[20:56] me013 | or tryi
"[20:58] me013 | They 're sort of separate . Unfortunately there 's coupling between them ,"
"[21:01] me013 | which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD ."
[21:08] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:11] me018 | But it seems like you should do both . Right ?
[21:13] me013 | You should do both and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline .
"[21:21] me013 | you know , we had the MFCC 's before , lots of people have done voice activity detectors ,"
[21:25] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[21:31] mn007 | Yeah .
[21:32] mn007 | Right .
"[21:32] me013 | And then let 's try and make everything better . Um ,"
"[21:37] me013 | and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it . But ,"
[21:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[21:48] me013 | um ,"
[21:53] mn007 | Yeah .
"[21:53] me013 | then they they looked pretty bad and and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all . But ,"
[21:58] me018 | Yeah . It seems like you should
[21:58] me013 | um .
"[22:02] me018 | And if it turns out that you can't improve on that , well ,"
"[22:11] me013 | uh , it should include sort of the current state of the art"
"[22:26] me013 | uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way . They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than"
"[22:33] me013 | a separate thing , but but they 'll have it on some level ."
"[22:36] me013 | So , um ."
"[22:41] me018 | you know , purposefully brain - damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline , or You know ?"
"[22:53] me013 | about the , uh the VAD issue ."
[22:54] me018 | Mmm .
[22:56] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[23:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[23:10] me013 | Uh .
"[23:25] mn007 | well , from OGI , these experiments on putting VAD on the baseline ."
"[23:31] mn007 | And these experiments also are using ,"
"[23:35] mn007 | uh , some kind of noise compensation , so spectral subtraction ,"
"[23:40] mn007 | and putting on - line normalization ,"
"[23:43] mn007 | um , just after this . So I think spectral subtraction , LDA filtering , and on - line normalization , so which is similar to"
"[23:51] mn007 | the pro proposal - one , but with spectral subtraction in addition , and it seems that on - line normalization doesn't help further"
[24:00] mn007 | when you have spectral subtraction .
[24:14] me018 | Mmm .
"[24:22] mn007 | the Aurora prop uh , proposals ,"
"[24:28] mn007 | So , yeah . I asked Sunil for more information about that ,"
[24:36] mn007 | Um .
"[24:43] mn007 | um , reference system which use a nice a a clean downsampling - upsampling ,"
[24:50] mn007 | which use a new filter that 's much shorter and which also cuts
"[24:57] mn007 | the frequency below sixty - four hertz , which was not done on our first proposal ."
"[25:02] me013 | When you say "" we have that "" , does Sunil have it now , too , or ?"
[25:03] mn007 | I
[25:06] me013 | OK .
"[25:06] mn007 | Because we 're still testing . So we have the result for ,"
[25:08] me013 | OK .
[25:13] mn007 | and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the KLT .
"[25:19] mn007 | Um , it seems to improve on the well - matched case ,"
[25:31] mn007 | I mean when we put the neural network .
[25:33] mn007 | And with the current weighting I think
[25:36] mn007 | it 's sh it will be better because the well - matched case is better .
[25:41] mn007 | Mmm .
"[25:48] mn007 | It 's like , uh , fff , fff um , ten percent relative ."
[25:58] mn007 | Yeah .
[26:00] me013 | OK .
"[26:09] mn007 | Uh - y w when I say it 's worse , it 's not it 's when I I uh , compare proposal - two to proposal - one , so ,"
[26:17] mn007 | r
"[26:17] mn007 | uh , y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network ."
[26:24] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[26:25] mn007 | I mean , this new system is is is better , because it has"
"[26:29] mn007 | um , this sixty - four hertz cut - off ,"
"[26:32] mn007 | uh , clean downsampling , and , um what else ?"
"[26:39] mn007 | Uh , yeah , a good VAD . We put the good VAD ."
[26:42] mn007 | So .
"[26:43] mn007 | Yeah , I don't know . I I j uh , uh pr"
[26:47] mn007 | Latency is short is Yeah .
[26:49] mn007 | And so
[26:49] me013 | So it 's better than the system that we had before .
[26:52] mn007 | Yeah . Mainly because of the sixty - four hertz and the good VAD .
[26:53] me013 | OK .
"[27:04] mn007 | And then I took this system and , mmm , w uh , I p we put the old filters also ."
"[27:09] mn007 | So we have this good system , with good VAD ,"
"[27:12] mn007 | with the short filter and with the long filter , and ,"
"[27:24] me013 | OK . So that 's that 's all fine . But what you 're saying is that when you do these So let me try to understand . When when you do these same improvements to proposal - one ,"
[27:34] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[27:35] me013 | that , uh , on the i things are somewhat better ,"
"[27:39] me013 | uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case and somewhat worse for the other two cases ."
[27:45] mn007 | Yeah .
"[27:49] me013 | The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ?"
"[27:59] mn007 | Yeah . Probably , yeah ."
[28:01] me013 | I get it .
"[28:08] mn007 | Uh . Yeah , but it 's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay ."
"[28:14] mn007 | to do something like proposal - two but having , um ,"
[28:18] mn007 | e
[28:18] mn007 | using also MSG features .
"[28:21] mn007 | So there is this KLT part , which use"
[28:22] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[28:27] mn007 | and then two neura two neural networks .
[28:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:31] mn007 | Mmm , and it doesn't seem to help ."
"[28:35] mn007 | Um , however , we just have one result , which is the Italian mismatch , so ."
[28:48] me013 | OK .
"[29:11] fn002 | Oh , well , I have the picture ."
[29:11] mn007 | t
[29:15] fn002 | Yeah .
[29:17] me018 | what sorts of features are you looking at ?
"[29:19] mn007 | So we would be looking at , um , the variance of the spectrum"
"[29:21] fn002 | uh , um , this , this , and this ."
"[29:26] mn007 | of the excitation , something like this ,"
[29:29] mn007 | which is should be high for voiced sounds .
[29:36] me018 | of the spectrum of excitation .
[29:42] mn007 | So basically the spectrum of the excitation for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh
[29:49] mn007 | e
"[29:53] me013 | the mel mel mel filter , uh , spectrum from the FFT spectrum . Right ."
"[30:03] me013 | So it 's it 's not really an excitation , but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation ."
[30:04] mn007 | No .
"[30:18] mn007 | Yeah . So , well , for unvoiced portion we have something tha"
"[30:23] mn007 | that has a mean around O point three , and for voiced portion the mean is O point fifty - nine ."
[30:31] mn007 | But the variance seem quite high . So Mmm .
"[30:41] fn002 | Yeah . We , uh , use TIMIT on this ,"
[30:46] mn007 | th Yeah .
"[30:57] mn007 | Uh , so it 's noisy TIMIT . That 's right . Yeah ."
[31:00] fn002 | Yeah .
"[31:04] mn007 | It seems quite robust to noise , so when we take we draw"
"[31:08] mn007 | its parameters across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence , it 's very close ."
[31:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[31:29] me018 | Ho - how does it work ?
[31:31] mn007 | Right now we just are trying to find some features .
[31:34] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:34] mn007 | And , uh Yeah . Hopefully , I think"
"[31:39] mn007 | what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,"
"[31:45] mn007 | um well , to to obtain a statistical model on these features and to or just to use a neural network"
[31:58] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[32:00] me018 | that seemed pretty encouraging . Right ?
[32:03] mn007 | Except the variance is quite high . Yeah .
"[32:04] me018 | Well , y I I don't know that I would trust that so much because you 're doing these canonical mappings from TIMIT labellings . Right ? So ,"
[32:08] mn007 | Uh - huh .
[32:10] me018 | really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced . So that could be giving you a lot of variance .
[32:16] mn007 | Yeah .
[32:17] me018 | i it it may be that that you 're finding something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth .
[32:24] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[32:31] me013 | So another way of looking at it is that
"[32:33] me013 | um , the mel cepstru mel spectrum , mel cepstrum ,"
"[32:43] me013 | By going back to the FFT ,"
[32:45] me013 | you 're getting something that is more like the raw data .
[32:57] me013 | of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ?
[33:23] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[33:25] me013 | you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data and and"
[33:28] me018 | Right .
[33:31] me018 | Right .
[33:31] me013 | m maybe there 's something there that the system can use .
[33:33] mn007 | Yeah .
"[33:40] mn007 | well , using the th the FFT ,"
"[33:44] mn007 | um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean . But So ,"
[33:51] me013 | Yeah .
[33:54] mn007 | this is why we we started to look by having
[33:57] mn007 | sort of voiced
[34:04] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:09] me013 | and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,"
"[34:12] me013 | because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced , both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then ,"
"[34:20] me013 | uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said , that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect ."
"[34:35] me013 | but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version ."
[34:42] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[34:54] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[34:55] me013 | Um , obviously you have something about the excitation ,"
"[34:58] me013 | um ,"
"[35:13] me013 | uh , a scattershot at a few different"
"[35:16] me013 | ways of look of characterizing that difference and , uh , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps ."
[35:21] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
"[35:29] me018 | Or , what 's the use of the the voiced - unvoiced detector ?"
[35:41] me018 | It 's not part of a VAD system that you 're doing ?
[35:44] fn002 | No .
"[35:45] mn007 | Uh , no . No . No , the idea was , I guess , to to use them as as features ."
"[35:46] me018 | Oh , OK ."
[35:50] me018 | Features . I see .
"[35:54] mn007 | Yeah , it could be , uh it could be a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection ,"
[36:00] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[36:01] mn007 | but it could be in the also the big neural network that does phoneme classification .
[36:04] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[36:12] me013 | so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together
"[36:16] me013 | these , um , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture . So it 's so ,"
"[36:25] me018 | I think it 's a neat thing . Uh , it seems like a good idea ."
[36:28] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:36] me013 | Yeah . I mean , I know that , um ,"
[36:40] me013 | people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad .
[37:00] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[37:03] me013 | So .
[37:06] me018 | how exactly do you make the difference between the FFT and the smoothed spectral envelope ?
"[37:13] me018 | Wha - wh i i uh , how is that , uh ?"
"[37:21] fn002 | Uh , we distend the we have the twenty - three coefficient af after the mel f"
[37:35] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[37:36] fn002 | And i the interpolation i between the point is give for the triang triangular filter ,"
[37:43] fn002 | the value of the triangular filter and of this way we obtained this mode
[37:50] fn002 | this model speech .
[37:50] mn007 | S
"[37:55] me013 | to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that"
[37:55] fn002 | Yeah .
[37:58] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
[37:58] me013 | m value .
"[38:00] fn002 | mmm Yeah , it 's linear ."
[38:01] me018 | Mmm .
[38:03] me013 | Oh .
"[38:07] me018 | So you you end up with a vector that 's the same length as the FFT vector ? And then you just , uh , compute differences and ,"
[38:11] fn002 | Yeah .
[38:12] fn002 | Yeah .
[38:14] mn007 | Then we compute the difference . Yeah . Uh - huh .
[38:16] me013 | OK .
[38:20] me018 | Oh ! OK .
[38:23] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[38:27] fn002 | Two thou two fifteen hundred ? No .
[38:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[38:31] me013 | Right .
[38:31] fn002 | Two hundred and fifty thousand .
[38:32] mn007 | Fifteen hundred . Because Yeah .
[38:33] fn002 | Two thousand and fifteen hundred .
"[38:47] me013 | Yeah . No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies ."
[38:55] fn002 | Yeah .
[39:03] me018 | Uh - huh .
"[39:04] me013 | at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically ."
[39:08] me018 | Like which of the ?
[39:11] mn007 | So this is Yeah .
[39:12] me018 | Yeah .
"[39:14] me013 | this , uh , spectrum or log spectrum , whatever it You - you 're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain ?"
"[39:15] me018 | Right , right ."
[39:19] mn007 | In log domain . Yeah .
"[39:21] me013 | OK . So it 's sort of like division , when you do the yeah , the spectra ."
[39:23] fn002 | Yeah .
"[39:23] mn007 | Uh , yeah ."
[39:24] me018 | It 's the ratio .
[39:38] mn007 | So .
[39:38] me018 | what is that doing .
"[39:40] mn007 | Yeah . What happen if what we have have what we would like to have is some spectrum of the excitation signal ,"
[39:40] me013 | Yeah . I guess that makes sense . Yeah .
[39:48] mn007 | which is for voiced sound ideally a a pulse train
[39:51] me018 | Uh - huh .
[39:55] me018 | Uh - huh . Right .
[40:02] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[40:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:08] mn007 | if we , like , remove the mel filter bank from the FFT ,"
[40:13] mn007 | we have something that 's close to the excitation signal .
[40:20] me013 | Yeah .
[40:22] me018 | Yeah .
[40:24] me013 | Yeah .
[40:24] me018 | I see .
[40:28] mn007 | So - It 's Y yeah .
[40:30] mn007 | You have several some unvoiced ?
[40:38] mn007 | This is another voiced example . Yeah .
"[40:40] fn002 | No . But it 's this ,"
[40:41] fn002 | but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation for the difference and this is the difference .
[40:43] mn007 | Right .
[40:44] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[40:48] me018 | This is the difference . OK .
[40:48] mn007 | Yeah .
[40:50] me013 | Yeah .
[40:51] me006 | Hmm .
[40:52] me018 | Hmm .
"[40:52] fn002 | Yeah . Because we begin , uh , in fifteen"
[40:56] fn002 | point the fifteen point .
[40:58] fn002 | Fifteen p
[41:03] me013 | Pitch .
[41:03] mn007 | Yeah . It 's the pitch . Yeah . Mm - hmm .
[41:03] me018 | the pitch ? OK .
[41:04] me013 | Yeah . That 's like fundamental frequency .
[41:06] me018 | OK . I see .
"[41:20] me013 | uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech , in which you have"
[41:25] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[41:26] fn002 | This is the the auto - correlation the R - zero energy .
"[41:31] me013 | Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say "" I don't care about the source "" . Right ?"
"[41:34] mn007 | Well , I mean for the the energy ."
[41:34] me018 | Right . Right .
[41:36] fn002 | Yeah . Here .
[41:38] mn007 | They should be more close .
"[41:40] fn002 | Ah , no . This is this ? More close . Is this ?"
[41:43] fn002 | And this .
[41:44] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[41:46] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[41:47] me013 | So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , you get something closer to that ."
[41:48] mn007 | This is less it 's less robust .
[41:50] fn002 | Less robust . Yeah .
[41:56] me018 | Yeah .
[41:59] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[42:06] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[42:06] me013 | power spectrum domain .
"[42:11] me013 | sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation ."
[42:23] me013 | It 's not really what 's happening in the vocal tract so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation .
[42:24] me018 | Yeah . Right .
"[42:33] me013 | conservative way , when I was saying "" well , it 's yeah ,"
[42:44] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[42:49] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[42:55] me018 | Right .
"[42:56] me013 | Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying "" OK , our feature set will be the FFT "" ,"
[43:05] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[43:07] me018 | Yeah .
"[43:07] me013 | So what is it ? And then you go back to the intuition that , well , you don't really get the excitation , but you get something related to it ."
[43:12] me018 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[43:13] me013 | And it and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something that shows some periodicity , uh , in frequency ,"
[43:19] me018 | Hmm .
"[43:19] me013 | you know , and and and also in time . So so ,"
[43:21] me018 | That 's that 's really neat .
[43:23] me018 | So you don't have one for unvoiced picture ?
[43:27] me018 | Oh .
[43:28] me013 | Yeah .
[43:36] me018 | I would li I would like to see those pictures . Yeah .
"[43:37] fn002 | Well , so ."
[43:38] me013 | Yeah .
[43:40] me013 | Yeah .
[43:40] fn002 | now .
[43:42] me013 | Yeah .
[43:50] fn002 | Pfft .
[43:51] me018 | Huh .
"[43:51] fn002 | Oops . The mean is different with it , because the the histogram for the the classifica Oh !"
[44:02] fn002 | Hmm .
[44:09] me018 | You end up with a similar difference
[44:11] me018 | over here ?
[44:12] mn007 | Yeah .
[44:13] me018 | OK . Cool !
[44:24] fn002 | two hundred fifty - six point and this is with five hundred twelve .
[44:27] me018 | Oh .
[44:29] me018 | OK .
"[44:30] mn007 | Yeah . This is kind of inter interesting also because if we use the standard , uh , frame length of of , like , twenty - five milliseconds ,"
"[44:49] mn007 | you don't clearly see this periodic structure ,"
[44:51] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[44:56] me018 | So this one inclu is a longer Ah .
[45:06] mn007 | Yeah .
[45:07] me018 | I see .
[45:09] me018 | Yeah .
[45:10] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:10] me018 | Oh . Oh , so this i is this the difference here ,"
[45:13] me018 | for that ?
[45:16] fn002 | The frame .
"[45:17] me018 | Oh , that 's the f the original ."
[45:18] fn002 | This is the fra the original frame .
[45:20] me018 | Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[45:21] fn002 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:25] fn002 | And here No , well ."
"[45:27] mn007 | Yeah . So probably we 'll have to use , like , long f long frames . Mm - hmm ."
[45:30] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[45:31] me006 | Hmm .
[45:34] me013 | Mmm .
"[45:35] me013 | Yeah , maybe ."
"[45:43] me013 | you know , if you actually j uh , need to do place along an FFT , it may be it may be pushing things ."
[45:49] mn007 | Yeah .
"[45:52] me018 | Would you would you wanna do this kind of , uh , difference thing after you do spectral subtraction ?"
[46:00] fn002 | No .
[46:01] fn002 | Maybe we can do that .
[46:12] me013 | The spectral subtraction is being done
"[46:15] me013 | at what level ? Is it being done at the level of FFT bins or at the level of , uh , mel spectrum or something ?"
"[46:26] me013 | I mean , how are they doing it ?"
[46:27] mn007 | How they 're doing it ? Yeah .
"[46:32] mn007 | I guess Ericsson is on the , um , filter bank , no ?"
"[46:34] fn002 | FFT . Filter bank , yeah ."
[46:43] mn007 | I i it Yeah .
[46:46] me018 | Seems like you 'd wanna do it on the FFT bins .
"[46:50] me018 | I I mean , if you were gonna uh , for for this purpose , that is ."
[46:53] me013 | Yeah .
[46:55] me013 | Yeah .
[46:55] mn007 | Mm - hmm .
[47:03] me013 | What else ?
[47:16] mn007 | the new filters and Yeah .
[47:22] me013 | OK .
"[47:30] me013 | source , or ?"
"[47:46] mn007 | It 's , um , in June ."
[47:49] me018 | June .
"[47:50] me013 | Early June , late June , middle June ?"
[47:53] mn007 | I don't know w
[47:54] me013 | Hmm .
[47:55] me006 | Hmm .
"[48:20] fn002 | Oh , I I am doing this ."
"[48:22] fn002 | Yeah , yeah . I don't know . I 'm sorry , but"
[48:22] me013 | Yes .
"[48:35] me013 | Yeah , well . You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime , and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too ."
"[48:54] me013 | w we are we 're in the , uh ,"
[49:01] mn007 | Yeah .
[49:08] me013 | anything to
[49:11] me013 | talk about ?
"[49:15] me026 | I said I was , um , going to use Avendano 's method of , um ,"
"[49:20] me026 | using a transformation , um , to map from"
[49:23] me026 | long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .
"[49:30] me026 | He has a trick for doing that involving viewing the DFT as a matrix . Um ,"
"[49:36] me026 | but , uh , um , I decided not to do that after all because"
[49:42] me026 | I I realized to use it I 'd need to have these
[49:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[49:53] me026 | take , um , audio as input ,"
[49:57] me026 | So I decided that I I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows and then just re - synthesize audio and then send that .
[50:13] me013 | Yeah ?
[50:17] me026 | because then I could just feacalc as is and I wouldn't have to change the code .
"[50:21] me013 | Oh , OK ."
"[50:25] me013 | um ,"
[50:27] me013 | certainly in a short short - term this just sounds easier .
[50:30] me026 | Uh - huh .
"[50:30] me013 | Yeah . I mean , longer - term if it 's if it turns out to be useful , one one might want to"
[50:35] me026 | Right . That 's true .
"[50:37] me013 | Uh , uh , I mean , in in other words , you you may be putting"
[50:37] me026 | But e u
[50:41] me013 | other kinds of errors in from the re - synthesis process .
"[50:54] me013 | I mean , it 's it 's it 's , uh ,"
[51:10] me013 | something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process .
"[51:21] me026 | That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it . Uh - huh ."
"[51:21] me013 | That was it , huh ? OK ."
[51:23] me013 | OK .
"[51:24] me013 | Um , anything to add ?"
[51:25] me006 | Um .
"[51:26] me006 | Well , I 've been continuing reading . I went off on a little tangent this past week , um ,"
"[51:42] me006 | and , uh , the importance of it in speech recognition . And I found some some , uh ,"
"[51:48] me006 | neat papers , um , historical papers from , um ,"
[51:56] me013 | Yeah .
"[52:02] me006 | and , um , e they modify the , uh they they they measure the relative importance of having different ,"
[52:13] me013 | Yeah .
[52:23] me006 | Um .
[52:27] me006 | Yeah .
"[52:27] me013 | And and , uh , the the MSG features were sort of built up"
[52:30] me006 | Right .
[52:38] me013 | But i m
[52:39] me006 | Mmm .
[52:42] me006 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:51] me013 | Oh , I see ."
[52:52] me006 | Yeah .
"[52:52] me013 | Well , that 's sort of what MSG does ."
[52:54] me006 | Yeah .
[52:55] me006 | Mm - hmm .
[52:58] me006 | S
[52:59] me013 | Yeah .
[52:59] me006 | Yeah .
"[53:01] me013 | Anyway , we 'll talk more about it later . Yeah ."
[53:02] me006 | OK . We can talk more about it later .
[53:03] me013 | Yeah . Yeah .
[53:04] me006 | Yeah .
"[53:13] me026 | Oh , OK ."
"[55:26] me006 | Um ,"

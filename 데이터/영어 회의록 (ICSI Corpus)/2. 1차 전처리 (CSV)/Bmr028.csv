[00:00] me011 | And we 're going .
"[00:05] me011 | So the only status ite well , first of all we h haven't decided whether we 're"
"[00:09] me011 | Meeting Recorder data issues , or"
[00:12] me011 | recognition this week .
[00:14] me011 | I think we were recognition .
"[00:16] me013 | Wha - what was on the list ? Th - the I mean , I sent you a couple things , although I don't remember them ."
"[00:20] me011 | You only sent me one thing , which was demo status ."
[00:24] me013 | Right .
[00:26] me013 | Ah . That was the second thing . Right . Right .
[00:31] me011 | So should we simply assert that this week we are
"[00:33] me011 | recognition , and next week data issues , and ?"
[00:34] fe008 | Hmm .
[00:35] me018 | I think that 's correct .
"[00:36] fe008 | Yeah . I think so , too . Yeah ."
[00:37] me018 | Yeah .
"[00:38] me011 | So , I think what we should probably do is any"
"[00:41] me011 | quick , small stuff we can do every week ."
[00:43] me011 | So like Morgan asked about the demo status . We can go ahead and talk about that a little bit .
"[01:02] me011 | I gotta double check the dates . But , anyway ."
"[01:06] me011 | So , uh , demo status . First of all , I did a little thing for Liz with the Transcriber tool ,"
"[01:11] me011 | that , um first of all , it uses the forced alignments ,"
"[01:15] me011 | so that the words appear ,"
"[01:17] me011 | uh , in their own segments ,"
[01:21] mn017 | Oh .
[01:23] me011 | she thought that was a much better idea for
[01:25] me011 | the other stuff she 's working on .
[01:27] mn017 | Yeah . That 's great .
[01:29] me011 | And that works fine except it 's even slower to load . It 's already pretty slow to load .
[01:31] mn014 | Yeah . It 's more segments ? Or ? Yeah .
[01:33] mn017 | Is that because the transcripts get longer ? The f transcript file gets longer ?
[01:33] mn014 | Yeah .
[01:35] me011 | Yeah .
[01:35] mn014 | Yep .
[01:36] me011 | Yep .
[01:37] me011 | And the Transcriber tool is just
[01:41] mn017 | But th but that 's that 's n You didn't have to change
"[01:45] mn017 | the software for that yet . Right ? It 's just formatting the right kind of , uh , XML ?"
[01:46] me011 | Correct .
"[01:48] me011 | Yeah , it 's just writing conversion tools from the"
[01:51] me011 | format
[01:51] me011 | that the
[01:53] me011 | Actually th he did a
[01:55] me011 | SRT file for it .
[01:56] mn017 | Mm - hmm . OK .
[01:57] me011 | And then just back into Transcriber Transcriber format .
"[01:58] mn017 | Oh , good . That 's very good . OK ."
"[02:04] me011 | Liz was talking about I decided that I would do ,"
[02:04] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:08] me011 | um , only enough to get it working , as opposed to any coding ."
[02:11] mn017 | Right .
"[02:12] me011 | And so the other thing I sh she wanted to display the stylized F zeroes , I think they 're called ?"
[02:17] me011 | Is that right ?
[02:17] me001 | Yeah . The linear fit .
[02:17] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[02:19] me011 | So what I did is I just took the file with those in it , converted it so that it looks like an audio file ."
[02:24] mn017 | Right .
"[02:24] me011 | And , so you s it shows that instead of the wavefile ."
"[02:27] me011 | And so that that 's working , and I think it actually looks pretty good ."
[02:27] mn017 | Cool .
[02:29] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[02:34] me011 | we seemed to have
[02:35] me011 | lots of stuff going on when
[02:37] me011 | no one 's saying anything .
[02:38] me001 | That 's just background speech .
[02:40] me011 | Ah .
[02:40] me001 | Yeah .
[02:42] me001 | So .
"[02:45] me018 | Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ? Or ?"
[02:48] me011 | No . I the
[02:50] me011 | audio file you can specify any sampling rate .
"[02:52] me011 | And so I s I specified instead of ,"
"[02:54] me011 | you know , sixteen thousand or eight thousand , I specified a hundred ."
[02:57] me018 | Mmm .
"[02:58] me011 | Um ,"
"[02:58] me011 | and , the only problem with that is that there 's a bug in"
"[03:01] me011 | Transcriber ,"
"[03:03] me011 | that if the sample rate is too low , when it tries to compute the shape file ,"
[03:06] me011 | it fails .
[03:08] mn017 | Hmm .
"[03:08] me011 | Um , and crashes ."
"[03:10] me011 | But the solution to that is just ,"
"[03:11] me011 | set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file ,"
"[03:14] me011 | and it will work and the only problem with that is you can't ,"
"[03:17] me011 | uh , zoom out on it . You can zoom in , but not out ."
[03:20] me013 | What 's a shape file ?
"[03:22] me011 | The shape file is If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen ."
[03:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[03:29] me011 | So what Transcriber does , is it computes a another thing to display based on the"
[03:35] me011 | And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . So there 's a little
[03:39] me011 | user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution .
[03:42] me013 | I see .
"[03:43] me011 | And if you don't compute the wavefile , you can't"
[03:46] me011 | zoom
[03:47] me011 | out . You can't get a larger view of it . But you can zoom in .
[03:51] mn017 | Hmm .
"[03:53] me011 | And that 's alright , because at at a hundred samples that 's already pretty far out ."
"[03:58] me011 | And , uh so I think it looks pretty good , but I 'll let Liz look at it and see what she thinks ."
[04:00] mn017 | Hmm .
"[04:03] fe016 | Sorry . I got the wavefile , but I couldn't get the words yet . But the the wavefile part looks looks good ."
[04:08] me011 | OK .
"[04:11] me011 | If you were having problems with the words , we should"
[04:13] me011 | figure out why .
[04:15] fe016 | I I 'll have done I 'm probably doing something wrong .
[04:18] fe016 | Sorry this microphone 's moving around .
[04:24] fe008 | It could Do you have to put it in your ear ?
[04:25] me011 | You c you clip that part over your ear .
[04:34] fe016 | Darn !
[04:38] fe008 | I Does it really need to go in her ear ? That that bud ? It doesn't have to go in her ear . Right ?
"[04:42] me011 | Uh , no . It doesn't have to , but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it ."
"[04:45] fe008 | Oh , wow ."
[04:46] me011 | Is that the bud 's in the ear and that the link is over it .
[04:50] me013 | This bud 's for No .
"[04:58] me011 | And that actually shouldn't be too slow ,"
"[05:00] me011 | uh , because it 's much lower resolution than a full waveform ."
[05:02] mn014 | Yeah .
[05:03] me011 | The problem with it is just it does require coding .
[05:06] me001 | Yeah . It migh
"[05:06] me011 | And so it would be much better to get ,"
"[05:07] me011 | uh , Dave Gelbart to do that than me , because he 's familiar with the code ,"
[05:11] me011 | and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly .
"[05:13] me001 | It 'd be nice if we can do , like , a quick hack , just so we can play the audio file , too ."
[05:17] fe016 | Right .
"[05:18] me011 | Oh , OK ."
"[05:24] me001 | it might be better to , rather , play the waveform than display it ."
"[05:27] me001 | I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played ."
[05:27] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[05:29] me011 | I understand what you mean .
[05:32] me001 | And then displayed .
[05:34] me011 | Ps -
"[05:41] me011 | The problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load ,"
"[05:47] mn017 | this uh , the sluggishness of the loading is all due to the parsing of the XML format . Right ?"
[05:59] me011 | that
[06:00] me011 | going from the XML to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast .
[06:03] mn017 | Hmm .
[06:03] me011 | But then it walks the tree to assemble its dat internal data structures and that 's slow .
[06:07] mn017 | Mmm .
[06:11] me018 | not everything is displayed in that tree at once . Right ?
"[06:15] me011 | Uh , no . But what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then ."
[06:17] mn017 | But d y
[06:20] me018 | Right .
[06:21] me011 | And then displays all the user interface components .
[06:22] me018 | Seems like you wanna ass
[06:27] me011 | Yes .
"[06:28] me013 | And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ?"
[06:32] mn017 | No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript . Right .
[06:34] me011 | A new transcript .
[06:35] mn014 | Yep .
[06:37] me011 | Or audio file .
"[06:38] me011 | Well , actually the audio files are pretty fast , too ."
[06:40] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:40] me001 | Yeah .
[06:43] mn017 | You just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop .
[06:45] me001 | Yeah .
[06:46] fe016 | Yeah .
[06:46] me011 | Right . The only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you wanna switch from one thing to another .
[06:48] fe016 | Right .
[06:51] mn014 | Yeah .
[06:53] fe016 | Right .
[06:54] fe016 | I guess for the demo you can always
"[06:56] fe016 | play just store the pieces that you 're gonna display and play those as separate files , if we can't , you know , actually do it ."
[07:01] mn017 | Just make shorter files .
"[07:03] fe016 | But it 's you know , it it 's Yeah ."
[07:03] me011 | That 's true . We could just subset it .
[07:04] me011 | That 's a good idea . That 's actually probably the right thing to do .
[07:05] mn017 | Yeah .
[07:05] fe016 | And just
[07:06] fe016 | make it l
[07:06] mn014 | Yep .
"[07:08] me011 | You know , just take"
[07:08] me011 | f ten minutes instead of an hour and a half .
[07:09] mn014 | Yeah . Th - that 's what I did for for my talk .
[07:13] me011 | Yeah .
"[07:13] me013 | Oh , yeah that @ @ ."
[07:14] mn014 | Yeah .
[07:15] me011 | Yeah . So that that 's actually the definitely the way to do it .
[07:17] mn014 | Yeah .
"[07:23] me011 | Yeah , if there are any problems ."
[07:26] fe016 | Right .
"[07:26] me011 | Yeah , I mean , even five minutes is probably enough ."
[07:29] mn014 | Huh .
[07:29] fe016 | Right .
"[07:30] fe016 | So , what happened to Is it st possible at all to display the words in their aligned locations ?"
[07:35] me011 | That 's what I did .
"[07:36] fe016 | OK . So . Sorry , I missed OK . Great ! But it OK ."
[07:36] me011 | Yeah .
[07:45] fe016 | I 'll I 'll work on it with Don and see what I 'm doing wrong .
"[07:50] fe016 | OK . Great ! Well , thanks a lot . That 's really great ."
"[07:53] me011 | And for the information retrieval ,"
"[07:55] me011 | uh , Don has been working on that . So ."
[07:58] me011 | It looks like it
"[08:01] me001 | Just hacking Dan 's code and m stepping through it . But , I think it 's close ."
"[08:10] me001 | at least with ,"
"[08:11] me001 | you know , being able to search over"
"[08:15] me001 | c certain amount of meetings , just , like , really basic stuff . Just asking fo looking for a word , and looking through a bunch of different meetings ."
"[08:21] me001 | And if we have time , I 'll also add , you know , like , choosing which speakers you wanna include ,"
[08:32] me013 | what you guys have .
[08:37] me001 | the d ?
[08:39] me001 | OK .
[08:41] me001 | OK .
"[08:44] me011 | stuff Liz was talking about , we have something that 'll work now ."
[08:47] me011 | And Liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else .
[08:50] me011 | Maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other .
"[09:00] me011 | Um , I think I 'd h I 'd have to ask Dave . I did it once before and it was just so slow to scroll ,"
[09:06] me011 | that I gave up .
[09:06] fe016 | Huh .
"[09:07] me011 | But ,"
[09:08] me011 | the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate . And so then it might be alright .
[09:11] fe016 | Right .
[09:12] fe016 | OK . Let me know .
"[09:14] me001 | Morgan , when 's the demo ?"
[09:19] me013 | on
[09:20] me013 | July
[09:22] me013 | sixteenth . It 's a Mon - Monday in
[09:26] me013 | four weeks ?
[09:27] me013 | Three weeks ?
[09:29] mn017 | If if raw speed is the problem This thing is written in Tcl . Right ?
[09:32] me011 | Tcl .
"[09:43] me011 | I mean , we could check . I don't think they do ."
"[09:46] me011 | Um , there was actually a Java back - end that apparently is actually a little faster ."
[09:51] me011 | It generates byte code .
[09:51] mn017 | Hmm .
[09:54] me013 | It 's always exciting to hear that Java 's faster than something .
"[09:58] me011 | Well ,"
"[09:58] me011 | e everything is faster than Tcl - TK . It 's a string substitution language , basically ."
[10:00] me013 | Yeah .
[10:06] fe008 | But Tcl is wonderful .
"[10:08] me011 | Well , it is wonderful ."
"[10:09] me011 | It is , for prototyping and user interface . It 's just really the language is awful ."
[10:11] fe008 | There you go .
[10:13] fe008 | Oh .
[10:22] me013 | We 're all entitled to our opinions here .
[10:24] me011 | Yep .
"[10:33] me013 | And , uh , my talk 's the first day . So ."
[10:35] me001 | OK .
[10:37] me013 | I 'm flying out there the Sunday before . So .
"[10:44] me013 | I guess , you know , it 'd be"
"[10:46] me013 | desirable if , a week ahead of that , we basically had thought we had it ,"
[10:50] me013 | which would allow a week for
"[10:53] me011 | Oh , that 's right ."
[10:53] me013 | re - iterating .
[10:56] me011 | Then the other
"[10:57] me011 | issue related to that is data release . If we wanna show this in public , it should be"
"[11:02] me011 | releas So , I , uh , haven't gotten any other replies from the original email"
[11:07] me011 | asking for approval . So I sent out another set this morning .
[11:10] me013 | I th I saw that .
"[11:11] me011 | And , uh , we 'll see if we get any responses ."
[11:16] me011 | Did you notice I put in the filter ?
[11:19] fe016 | No !
[11:20] fe016 | No ! No ! I just figured you p
"[11:26] fe016 | Oh , my gosh ."
"[11:26] me011 | filter by a regular expression , you can ."
[11:28] fe016 | OK .
[11:30] me011 | I put that in just for you .
"[11:31] fe016 | Well , since you didn't answer the emai So there was a q question I had asked Adam whether it 's possible to search only for your own"
[11:47] fe016 | Great .
"[11:49] me011 | It 's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression . But if you search your name ,"
[11:52] fe016 | Good .
[11:54] me011 | you 'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name . So .
[11:57] fe016 | That 's great .
[11:57] me013 | And it 's it 's case insensitive ? Yeah .
[11:59] me011 | Correct .
[11:59] fe016 | That 's great .
[12:02] me018 | Did you actually look through your transcripts ? Or you just approved them all .
[12:06] me018 | I just approved all mine . I didn't look at them .
[12:13] fe016 | the keywords for things that I thought I had said wrong . So .
[12:16] me011 | It 's hard to find .
[12:18] fe016 | That makes it g
[12:18] me018 | That 's a compliment to you .
[12:19] me018 | He said it 's hard to find things you say wrong .
[12:22] me011 | Hmm .
[12:23] me011 | Yep .
[12:26] me011 | You really do have to sort of r
"[12:31] me013 | So , we have our first information retrieval"
[12:33] me011 | Yeah . That 's right .
"[12:36] fe016 | Yeah ! That 's actually Well , it 's useful ."
[12:36] me013 | searcher .
"[12:38] me011 | And it demonstrates why it doesn't work , because you really wanna go acro more than one meeting ."
[12:41] me013 | Yeah .
[12:42] me013 | Yeah .
[12:42] me011 | And you need a better user interface for displaying the results . So .
[12:45] fe016 | But this helps a lot .
[12:46] me011 | Yeah .
"[12:47] me013 | You wanna say , "" Where are al where Find all the contentious things I said . """
[12:48] fe016 | Great . Thanks .
"[12:54] me011 | That 's right . Th - we do have that bi nice marker is that , n n"
"[12:58] me011 | because we all know we 're being recorded , whenever anyone says anything like that , we then have a conversation about bleeping it out . So ."
[12:59] fe016 | Right .
[13:01] fe016 | We -
"[13:03] fe016 | Yeah . You can search for "" beep "" or "" bleep "" ."
[13:04] me011 | Yep .
[13:05] me013 | Yeah .
[13:06] fe016 | In somebody else 's turn .
[13:11] me011 | Um . Oh . And also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms .
"[13:21] me011 | uh , generate"
[13:23] me011 | the transcripts for NSA . That there are a few with no speaker forms .
"[13:29] me011 | I sent out yet another this morning , which I think makes six total emails that I 've sent to these people , and so I think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them ."
[13:44] me013 | Right .
"[13:47] mn017 | Like in the morning , when I leave for work ."
[13:48] me011 | Nope .
"[13:52] me013 | He 's not around , is the only problem ."
"[13:54] fe008 | Oh , is that right ? Oh . I saw him I saw him on Tuesday ."
"[13:55] me013 | Yeah . Otherwise , it 'd be a good idea ."
"[13:58] me013 | Yeah . He popped in . But , I mean , he 's basically gone ."
"[13:59] fe008 | Oh , OK ."
"[14:02] me011 | Well , if I could find phone numbers , that would certainly work . But ."
"[14:04] fe008 | Well , did you ask Lila ? Cuz I bet she has this information ."
"[14:07] me011 | Yeah , that 's a good idea . I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down ."
[14:08] me013 | Yeah .
[14:09] fe008 | Yeah .
[14:09] me013 | Yeah . And and tell her You know .
[14:14] fe008 | M
"[14:16] fe008 | Miguel is still an active member of the group and he 's What I mean is , he 's an active member and he 's still here ."
[14:20] me013 | He 's right there . Yeah .
[14:21] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:21] fe008 | Very helpful .
"[14:22] me011 | Yeah , I didn't actually"
[14:23] me011 | see who they all were .
"[14:25] me011 | Um , a couple of them were , like , people at IBM who were here for one of the IBM meetings and one a guy from SRI who was at one of the SRI meetings ."
[14:25] me013 | Yeah .
"[14:32] me011 | And so , uh , those might be harder to track down ."
[14:38] me011 | Yep .
"[14:38] fe008 | Nice meetings , by the way . Yeah ."
"[14:41] me011 | I mean , they they were people who didn't have accounts at ICSI , so they 're they 're harder to find ."
[14:46] fe008 | Are you su ?
[14:48] me011 | Am I sure about what ?
[14:49] fe008 | Yeah . NSA - one and NSA - three ? We 're talking about those ?
[14:50] me011 | There were other people also .
"[14:52] me011 | There were other c other people also who didn't ha fill out the speaker forms , in addition to the N S As . Yeah ."
[14:54] me013 | I i in in other meetings . Yeah .
[15:04] me013 | Just we certainly have their email .
[15:08] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[15:08] fe008 | So th I 'm sure that we have , uh , fresh , you know , information on them ."
[15:11] me011 | Right .
"[15:13] me011 | Yeah . None of the e emails bounced , so I know they 're going somewhere ."
[15:16] fe008 | Good . OK .
[15:16] me013 | Right .
[15:21] me011 | That 's all I have .
[15:23] me011 | You wanna talk about recognition ?
[15:30] me018 | I was away for a couple of days . So .
[15:32] fe016 | We 're sort of in a
"[15:34] fe016 | stage where we 're uh , Don 's going through getting some of the next meetings that Jane s has . And , uh ,"
"[15:41] fe016 | you know , creating a second database . So we haven't actually run anything yet . We need to get a critical mass for that ."
"[15:47] mn017 | However , I just got an email from Thilo saying that"
"[15:52] mn017 | I mean , we have segmentations for the old meetings"
[15:53] fe016 | And check the segmentations . Yeah .
[15:55] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[15:58] fe016 | Great .
[16:01] mn014 | Yep .
[16:02] mn014 | Yep .
[16:04] mn014 | Yeah . Just Yeah . Just smooth the the output of the of the
[16:07] mn017 | Right . And you recommended using the one with two s maximum of two seconds ? But two s
[16:08] mn014 | detector .
[16:10] mn014 | Yeah .
"[16:11] fe016 | A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ? Do you mean a ?"
[16:11] mn014 | Yep .
[16:15] mn014 | the one with one second or whatever . I I I There 's no not much difference between the the one - second and the two - second one .
[16:19] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[16:28] mn017 | some speech . Right ?
[16:29] mn014 | And I think wouldn't it be better
[16:31] mn014 | to to have
[16:32] mn014 | a little longer sequences for the recognizer ? B eh because of the language model ? As sometimes it happens that that it cuts off within a s
[16:35] fe016 | Yeah .
"[16:40] mn014 | Yeah . But , we can be sure that as Or we can be er"
"[16:40] fe016 | No , it 's not bad . That 's good ."
[16:43] mn014 | not not
"[16:44] mn014 | totally sure , but"
[16:45] mn017 | Hmm .
[16:48] mn017 | Hmm .
[16:48] fe016 | i ye Yeah . th u
[16:50] me018 | What does the two - second threshold mean ?
[16:51] fe016 | I th I think that 's g that 's good .
[16:56] mn014 | IBM thing .
[16:58] mn014 | Yeah .
[16:59] me018 | Ah .
[16:59] mn014 | So . Yeah .
[17:02] mn017 | Hmm .
[17:03] mn014 | So .
"[17:04] me011 | Right . So the the trade - off is you get longer utterances , but you miss fewer utterances ."
[17:08] mn014 | Yeah . But but the the chunks are already sh
"[17:11] mn014 | i in general , are short . So I I t I think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together , in order to have"
[17:16] mn017 | Mmm .
[17:18] mn014 | better language model or language modeling .
[17:21] mn014 | I don't know .
[17:24] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:25] mn014 | Do that . Yeah .
[17:26] mn017 | See what the length distribution is . Yeah .
[17:27] mn014 | Yeah . But but y there 's there 's really not much difference between the one - second and the two - second . So just take the one the one - second one .
[17:30] mn017 | Really ?
[17:32] me018 | the language model would
[17:33] fe016 | Yeah .
[17:34] me018 | continue across two seconds .
"[17:36] fe016 | Well , yeah . Y you do , becau"
"[17:41] mn017 | Yeah , you 're gonna hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context . But you might"
[17:46] mn017 | hurt yourself more by having
"[17:48] mn017 | misrecognitions due to background speech , or , uh , y noise , or whatever ."
[17:54] mn014 | I I 'm not too afraid ab about that as
[17:56] mn014 | w when there when there would be something some background speech or something there wo there would be a a chunk in another
[18:02] fe016 | Yeah . I think it 's better .
[18:05] fe016 | The longer is better . There 's there 's th
[18:09] mn017 | Mm - hmm . OK . Sure .
[18:10] mn014 | So . I wou I would use th
[18:10] fe016 | Beca -
"[18:10] fe016 | There 's a l there 's a lot of these cases just like now , where I c"
[18:12] mn014 | Yeah .
"[18:15] fe016 | people say "" uh uh "" when they 're trying to ta and there 's about a half - second pause to a second in between and then another word ,"
[18:17] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[18:19] mn014 | Yep .
"[18:21] fe016 | and it 's much better if we can keep those together , I think ."
"[18:24] me011 | Yeah . It 's , uh , funny looking at some of the transcripts . I was filtering by person ,"
[18:28] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:28] me011 | and in one of the one of the early meetings , one pers particular person ,"
"[18:32] me011 | almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was "" yeah "" , "" uh - huh "" . It was just a whole list of them ."
[18:38] me011 | It was very funny .
[18:44] mn014 | No .
"[18:49] mn017 | to create a new set of split , uh , meetings ."
[18:51] me001 | Sure .
[18:55] mn017 | Right .
[18:55] mn014 | Mmm .
"[18:57] me011 | Uh , do we know about disk ?"
"[19:01] me011 | Uh , Abbott disk ?"
[19:03] me013 | Uh . I know they 're in .
[19:04] me011 | OK .
[19:06] me018 | Wel -
[19:08] me018 | He had a problem . Right ?
[19:08] me011 | Yep .
[19:09] mn014 | Yep .
[19:09] fe016 | Oh .
[19:14] me011 | Couldn't format them . No .
[19:15] me018 | I didn't hear anything after that .
[19:18] me011 | split them up . And so I wanted to make sure we had some available for you .
"[19:24] me001 | six , seven , eight gig on my disk ."
"[19:26] me011 | OK . So we 're OK we 're still OK for another couple days , then ?"
"[19:27] fe016 | And I have I have like another un - backed I ha have another six gig , which Jeremy , if you 're not using , can on XA ."
[19:31] me001 | Yeah .
[19:32] me013 | Wel -
"[19:33] me011 | So we 're OK for for a couple weeks , then ."
[19:33] me013 | Markham probably needs u
[19:35] me013 | H he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down . Right ? In order to do that ?
[19:36] fe016 | To you .
"[19:47] me013 | Well , no . I think he wanted u us to tell him"
[19:49] fe016 | How about during the picnic ?
[19:49] me011 | Ah .
[19:50] me013 | when .
"[19:54] me011 | Well , m my feeling about that"
[19:57] me011 | is p is p
"[19:59] me011 | Well , OK . That 's the point ."
[20:01] me011 | So it 's Jane that we have to coordinate that through .
"[20:03] me011 | Uh , what I was gonna say is , as soon as possible , and I 'm willing to not work for an hour to get it done ."
"[20:13] me013 | "" I 'm I 'm willing to not work for an hour . "" I know you 're willing to not work for an hour ."
"[20:19] fe016 | You 're really dedicated , if you 're No matter how you parse that one ."
[20:24] mn017 | OK .
"[20:24] me011 | But , uh , I think the per the people it"
[20:26] me011 | disrupts the most are the transcribers .
[20:31] fe008 | send them m a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time .
[20:35] fe008 | I did that with the last outage . I j I wrote to them letting them know that this w
[20:35] me011 | OK .
[20:35] mn017 | Hmm .
[20:36] me013 | I
[20:40] me011 | So early next week .
[20:43] me011 | And just as long as we have a little warning .
[20:45] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:45] fe016 | So that means we can't ,"
[20:45] fe008 | Yeah .
"[20:46] fe016 | um , save meeting data either . Right ?"
"[20:50] me011 | Uh , just not during that time when it 's down . But that it should be down for an hour ."
[20:53] fe016 | So it just can't so we can't have two meetings in a row where the first meeting 's during that hour . That 's all I meant .
[20:57] me011 | Right .
"[20:58] me011 | Well , no , we can store them here ."
"[20:58] fe016 | That that 's happening , like , today ."
[21:00] me011 | We can store them here .
[21:02] me011 | You we just run the risk that if you have a crash we lose the data . So .
[21:02] fe016 | Temporarily .
[21:05] me018 | They 're stored on Popcorn .
[21:05] fe008 | This is on Popcorn ? Or ?
"[21:05] fe016 | Well , no . I mea I mean , the fir Oh , jus OK ."
[21:07] me011 | Yep .
[21:08] fe008 | This is on Popcorn or something ? Yeah ? OK .
[21:09] me011 | Yep .
[21:15] me013 | We store we store our data on Popcorn .
[21:15] me011 | Anything else ?
[21:18] me013 | That 's really great .
[21:19] me011 | Excuse me ?
"[21:26] me013 | Uh , g megabytes and mega many megabytes , too ."
"[21:30] me013 | Um , what what , uh ?"
"[21:40] me013 | So uh , what what 's on your queue for for recognition experiments ? Let 's talk about that for a second , maybe ."
[21:41] mn017 | u un
[21:46] fe008 | What was the question ?
[21:47] me013 | What what was on his queue for recognition experiments ?
[21:50] me018 | I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem
"[21:56] me018 | um , putting in"
[21:58] me018 | the stream
[22:00] me018 | reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files .
[22:15] me018 | hacked a bunch of stuff together just to get it going . But the r the right way to do it is to
"[22:23] me018 | that 's what I 'm doing now . And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate"
[22:26] me018 | the P - files I need . Cuz we already have the feature files
[22:30] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[22:37] mn017 | I is that independent or related to also being able to write out the , uh , feature file i in the SRI format f r"
[22:44] me018 | It 's both . There 's a there 's an input stream and an output stream .
[22:45] me011 | Input reader and an output stream . Yeah .
[22:47] me018 | Yeah .
[22:55] mn017 | as an output format
[22:56] me011 | Yeah . That 's the point .
"[22:56] mn017 | the the Oh , OK ."
[22:58] me018 | Yeah .
"[23:01] me011 | Right . Quicknet is a very nice stream - based library , so without too much effort , once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools ."
[23:04] mn017 | Uh - huh .
"[23:08] mn017 | Oh , cool ."
[23:10] me011 | So .
[23:11] mn017 | Great .
"[23:13] me018 | So , then it 's t uh , tandem experiments after that ?"
[23:14] me013 | Uh - huh .
[23:15] me013 | Yeah .
[23:18] me011 | porting Quicknet to the multiprocessor Linux box .
"[23:23] me011 | You know , I I have forward passes working , but I haven't done training yet ."
[23:31] mn017 | Th - there 's some
"[23:33] mn017 | i impetus at , um ,"
"[23:37] mn017 | uh , build support Linux as a platform . So ."
[23:41] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[23:46] mn017 | also use a Li - eh
[23:58] me011 | i since it 's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special .
[24:00] mn017 | Right . Exactly .
[24:01] me011 | So . I mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine .
[24:03] mn017 | Yeah .
[24:06] me011 | Five more processors .
[24:08] mn017 | Uh . Yeah .
"[24:20] mn017 | you know , that wouldn't be a reason not to use Linux anymore . So ."
[24:23] me011 | Yep .
[24:23] me013 | Yeah .
"[24:25] me013 | Um , I think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do ,"
"[24:30] me013 | um , a recognition ,"
"[24:32] me013 | uh , pass"
[24:34] me013 | on one of the PZM
[24:36] me013 | mikes for these s same
[24:38] mn017 | For the meeting ?
"[24:39] me013 | meetings that you 've been gi n gi bi I mean ,"
"[24:41] me013 | it 's gonna be terrible , but , you know , we we just don't know how terrible ."
[24:41] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[24:45] fe016 | Ye - It 's also an interesting problem to come up with the reference .
[24:45] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[24:51] fe016 | the reference file
"[24:55] me011 | Oh , yeah . That 's really hard ."
"[24:57] fe016 | Well , i it 's an interesting question , because I was thinking "" well you can force align"
[24:58] me011 | It 's not determined .
"[25:01] fe016 | the transcriber transcripts , and then of course , you try to merge them in time ."
"[25:06] fe016 | But how do you score ? """
[25:10] fe016 | I mean it 's just an interesting problem .
[25:13] me011 | That would be a good first pass .
[25:15] me011 | Just ignore everything that has any overlap .
[25:15] mn017 | Mmm .
"[25:16] fe016 | Right . I mean , there 's a whole sort of dis Right . We Right ."
"[25:20] fe016 | But there 's a whole interesting discussion , cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either , and so um . In fact , we actually"
[25:24] me011 | Right .
[25:26] me013 | Yeah .
[25:27] fe016 | don't have a a p
[25:32] fe016 | Right . Right .
"[25:38] fe016 | Oh , I see . You mean when only one person is talki Yes . We could we could try tha Right ."
[25:39] me011 | Yep .
[25:43] fe016 | Right . Exactly .
[25:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[25:45] me013 | We just don't know how
[25:49] me001 | Hmm .
[25:51] me013 | is that i it seems like and we do don't know
"[25:54] me013 | this in detail , but it seems like you 're getting a lot from the channel adaptation , the speaker adaptation , and so forth ."
[25:55] mn017 | Mmm .
[25:58] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[26:01] me013 | Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something"
[26:05] mn017 | Mmm .
[26:10] mn017 | Right .
"[26:13] me013 | I mean , it 's gonna be bad ,"
[26:14] mn017 | Right .
"[26:15] me013 | but , uh , it may not be , like , "" won't decode "" kind of bad . It might might only be that it"
[26:18] mn017 | Right .
"[26:20] me011 | Yeah , eighty percent ."
[26:23] mn017 | Right .
[26:23] fe016 | Do you assume you know the speaker
[26:26] fe016 | when you do this ?
[26:26] me013 | I want us to assume the exac whatever it was you assumed
[26:30] me013 | when you did the other the the close mike .
[26:36] mn017 | Right .
"[26:38] mn017 | Yeah . That that becomes another problem , actually ."
[26:39] fe016 | No - It 's not a pro
[26:40] mn014 | Yeah .
"[26:41] me011 | But , for s for scoring , you can do it or not do it as you choose . So ."
[26:43] fe016 | R right . But in terms of for norm for adaptation . Right .
"[26:44] me013 | But you 're saying for this For the adaptation , you mean ."
"[26:48] fe016 | You know , do you do a supervised adaptation ?"
[26:51] me013 | Right .
[26:52] fe016 | Ye - All of these adaptations ha
"[26:53] mn017 | all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking . So ,"
[26:56] mn014 | Mmm .
[26:57] mn017 | you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the far - field micropho signal .
[26:57] fe016 | Yeah .
[27:06] mn017 | You mean you wanna cheat .
"[27:08] me011 | Well , you 're doing that anyway ."
[27:09] fe016 | N Well . I was just aski
[27:09] mn017 | No . If i i
[27:09] fe008 | Ooo . I don't like that term . I don't like that term .
[27:10] me011 | So ch chea try to cheat in the same way that you 're doing with the close - talking .
[27:14] fe008 | I don't like that term .
[27:16] me013 | I have a suggestion . Do the simplest thing first .
"[27:22] me013 | In other words , if you d"
"[27:24] me013 | No . It 's No . It 's even simpler thing than that , is just that you don't know ."
[27:28] mn017 | You mean you do you don't do all those normalizations .
[27:30] me011 | Yeah .
[27:31] me013 | Yeah .
"[27:32] fe016 | Oh , you m y totally unadapted . Uh . Right ."
[27:32] me011 | Just do or a free ri Yeah .
"[27:33] me013 | Yeah . Because you can get a number uh , for that with the other as well . Right ? You can turn those things off . Right ?"
[27:39] fe016 | i i
[27:45] fe016 | You can use a speaker eh What about gender detection ?
"[27:46] mn017 | A actually , it 's that it 's it 's We would have to retrain models that are not that have none of that stuff ,"
"[27:54] mn017 | uh ,"
"[27:58] mn017 | We can just run it , assuming that it 's all one speaker , basically . And see what happens ."
[28:02] me013 | Yeah .
[28:03] me013 | Yeah .
[28:06] fe016 | Yeah .
[28:06] mn017 | Yeah .
[28:09] me013 | because you wanna know how much that 's helping you in these cases anyhow .
[28:12] mn014 | But d
[28:12] mn014 | do you have gender - dependent models ?
"[28:13] mn017 | Actually , no . Th - th"
[28:14] mn017 | Sorry .
[28:14] mn014 | A Are the models gender - dependent ?
[28:16] me001 | Mmm .
[28:17] mn017 | Yeah .
[28:17] me011 | Yeah . They 're all gender - dependent . So we would have to at least do that .
[28:17] fe016 | Yeah . Yeah . So . You can r No . You can run both . And you can s
[28:20] mn014 | Yeah .
[28:21] mn014 | Yeah .
"[28:21] mn017 | No , actually , what Here 's here 's what we would usually do u under these circumstances ."
[28:21] me011 | And pick whichever 's better .
[28:26] mn017 | We would actually we would run some sort of segmentation .
"[28:29] mn017 | Thilo 's is as good as any , probably ."
"[28:32] mn017 | Um , and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments , to and and put"
[28:39] mn017 | the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo - speakers . And then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo - speakers .
[28:42] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[28:53] mn017 | the speaker segmentation given to you .
[29:00] me011 | adapted in some way ?
[29:05] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[29:06] me011 | That 's what I 'm just thinking one of the big differences with Broadcast News and these meetings is we have m many fewer participants .
[29:12] fe016 | The other thing is that you actually have
[29:13] mn017 | Right .
"[29:15] fe016 | direction here . So ,"
"[29:17] fe016 | unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w"
"[29:22] fe016 | you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location ."
[29:24] me011 | Speaker ID . Yeah .
"[29:36] fe016 | Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much ."
[29:42] me011 | And you have more than one mike .
"[29:44] me013 | Yeah . If you don't have one more than one mike , you don't have a very good handle on location ."
[29:51] me013 | That 's it 's not enough .
"[29:53] fe016 | I mean , that ,"
"[29:55] fe016 | um , Jane 's i n The pickup of Adam on this mike is gonna be different than me , in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting ."
[30:07] me011 | From mike . Yeah .
[30:08] me013 | Yeah .
[30:11] me011 | And transfer functions .
[30:12] fe016 | Right . Exactly .
"[30:15] me013 | sitting there , then it would Its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him , and so on ."
"[30:18] fe016 | They 're both picked up in the clustering , I guess ."
[30:19] me011 | lots of ways of doing it .
"[30:23] mn017 | uh , before you do the clustering to rule out those those types of things ."
"[30:26] fe016 | Or to just do the clustering , knowing that you 're capturing"
"[30:30] fe016 | both . It 's just that the kind of clustering we 've done before hasn't had that ,"
[30:31] me013 | I see .
"[30:34] fe016 | uh , distance factor , or"
[30:36] fe016 | location factor in it in the same way . And so we 're not really
[30:37] me013 | Yeah .
"[30:39] fe016 | modeling it directly . If somebody does , we sh maybe we add that because I think it would be a pretty big difference . When you listen ,"
[30:46] me011 | It 's a big difference . Yeah .
[30:50] mn017 | fun to try .
"[30:52] me011 | transfer function through the head , and things like that . So you know , even if you only have one ear ,"
[30:54] fe016 | Right . Even with one microphone .
[30:55] me013 | Yeah .
[30:57] me013 | Yeah .
[31:04] me011 | Yeah .
[31:11] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[31:11] me013 | any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance .
[31:13] mn017 | OK .
[31:16] mn017 | Hmm .
[31:17] me013 | We should at least get a first one .
[31:18] me011 | Something . Yeah .
[31:18] fe016 | OK . Hmm .
"[31:23] me013 | Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits , and , you know , and so with then it 'd be , you know , just throw that in and see ."
[31:27] me011 | Yeah . So it 'd be cool to see if it helped .
[31:29] fe016 | Yeah .
[31:30] me001 | Mm - hmm .
[31:32] me013 | Yeah .
"[31:33] me011 | That would be ft quick ,"
[31:33] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[31:41] me011 | Yep .
"[31:43] me011 | Can't you export C from Matlab ,"
[31:45] me011 | or is that Mathematica ?
[32:04] me013 | You think I didn't s tell him that ?
"[32:06] me013 | No . I got pretty excited , because it completely got rid of the speech . So , I was thinking "" well , so ,"
[32:09] me011 | So that 's a speech detector . That 's great .
[32:11] fe008 | That 's interesting .
"[32:13] fe008 | Did it get rid of other stuff , too , though ?"
[32:13] mn017 | Hmm .
[32:14] me013 | What ?
[32:15] fe008 | Did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech ? OK . Wow . Interesting .
[32:17] me011 | subtract that from the original signal and you 're set .
[32:20] me013 | Yeah .
[32:20] me013 | Yeah .
[32:26] me011 | Noise estimate . Signal to noise . That 's great .
[32:26] mn017 | the noise estimates . Right ? Yeah .
[32:29] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:37] me013 | only had priors , and our performance went up ."
[32:41] fe008 | Wow .
[32:42] me011 | I guess that 's why Herve always talks about using the priors as one of the mixtures in in his all - ways combos .
[32:46] mn017 | Hmm .
"[32:48] me013 | Well , of course it was a bug . But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty"
[32:51] fe008 | Wow . Interesting .
[32:54] mn017 | Yeah .
"[32:55] me011 | So if you run er , your recognizer with all probabilities equal , what do you get out ?"
[33:00] me011 | Probably garbage .
[33:03] mn014 | Yep .
[33:03] me011 | The pruning probably prunes everything out .
[33:09] me013 | So that 's how it was generated .
[33:10] mn017 | Yeah . So we have this new speaker adaptation .
"[33:14] mn017 | A b Oh , it 's a s sort of feature normalization t"
"[33:17] mn017 | uh , like f speaker adaptation , which ,"
"[33:20] mn017 | uh , which I wr which I wrote about in the last status report , which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on"
[33:26] mn017 | Hub - five .
"[33:28] mn017 | So , um . We haven't tried that yet on the meetings , uh , but hopefully it 'll help there , too ."
"[33:38] fe008 | I probably corrected something like ,"
"[33:40] fe008 | well , s It 's really a substantial amount of things that I 've caught , changed um , added to it ."
[33:53] mn017 | Hmm .
"[33:54] fe008 | um , and you compare it to the to runs on the old version , then you 're gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case ."
[33:55] me011 | Different .
[33:58] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[34:08] fe008 | As of February ?
"[34:08] mn017 | A a as of no , a little I don't know . When when did we"
[34:12] mn017 | grab the transcripts ?
[34:12] fe008 | So a l
[34:13] fe008 | Like the HLT paper ?
"[34:13] me001 | The b for the f ? It was m m March , probably ."
[34:14] fe016 | F Sorry .
[34:16] fe016 | For these meetings ?
[34:17] mn017 | We 're talking about which which version we 're using for evaluating the recognition . Which version of the transcripts .
[34:22] fe016 | Right . They 're somewhere in between
"[34:25] fe016 | January and late March , or something like that ?"
[34:28] me001 | Yeah . Something around there .
"[34:28] fe008 | OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell ."
"[34:29] me011 | But they are channelized ones , though ?"
"[34:30] mn017 | No , no . Yeah . O obviously . Yeah ."
[34:31] fe016 | N
[34:31] fe016 | N
"[34:33] fe008 | So long as i so long as it 's the same baseline you 'll be able to tell . But but I 'm just gonn I 'm just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data ,"
[34:39] fe008 | that it would be an a more optimistic outcome .
"[34:40] mn017 | Well , the and the other thing is , it takes only a a minute to rescore all the old outputs with If you had new transcripts , then"
[34:50] me011 | Right . Cuz you haven't done any training .
[34:51] mn017 | Sorry ?
[34:52] me011 | Right . Cuz we 're not doing it for training .
"[34:52] fe016 | Yeah . We haven't a modified the recognizer at all . So , actually , um ,"
[34:54] me011 | Right . So it 's really it would be really easy to re - do it .
"[34:57] fe016 | at some point we should update and rescore everything with , you know , the corrected transcripts ,"
[35:01] me011 | Yeah . It 'd be interesting just to see i how much it changes . I bet it wouldn't change a lot .
[35:03] fe016 | just to h
[35:05] fe008 | Yeah .
"[35:07] fe016 | Sometimes the changes are , um ,"
[35:13] me011 | That 's just what I was thinking .
"[35:16] fe016 | But it does help to get the backchannels back in , and things like that ."
[35:17] mn017 | Right .
"[35:19] mn017 | So , whenever the Right now , the s the scoring is based on segments ."
"[35:28] mn017 | So so , the the other way to do the scoring is using a a NIST format called"
[35:35] me011 | Yep . I we know about it .
"[35:47] mn017 | uh , you know , it You can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your references , and it will still do the right thing ."
"[35:53] mn017 | So , that 's what we need to basically , uh , to Hmm ?"
[35:55] me011 | Tran -
[35:56] me011 | Transcriber will export STM .
[35:59] mn017 | Oh .
[35:59] me011 | In case you care .
[36:02] me011 | OK .
[36:03] mn017 | We we strip away a lot of the
"[36:06] mn017 | mark - up ,"
"[36:07] mn017 | uh , in the transcripts , which ,"
[36:10] me011 | Right .
[36:12] fe016 | Would that ?
"[36:13] fe016 | Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ? I mean , I don't"
[36:19] fe016 | think that 's har I hardly ever see that . I think most of them are pretty good .
[36:27] fe008 | Mmm . I did .
"[36:28] mn017 | So , if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation , then we can't use them in the current way we do scoring ."
[36:35] mn017 | We have to m m switch to this o
"[36:37] fe016 | Oh , you mean you would need to re - run the recognition ."
[36:39] mn017 | No . We have to r
[36:43] mn017 | Right . Right .
[36:49] mn017 | That 's true .
[36:50] fe016 | You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that .
"[36:54] fe016 | Uh , in other words , it 's not"
"[37:01] mn017 | Like , suppose you fixed some typ No , Jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the"
"[37:07] mn017 | word error , then"
[37:08] mn017 | we can f we c
[37:09] fe016 | Y Yeah . Yeah .
"[37:09] me011 | If the segments change , that won't work ."
"[37:15] me011 | Well , I mean , what happens if you break one segment into two ?"
[37:18] me011 | Suddenly the don they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore .
"[37:22] mn017 | No , but that 's what the pr Well , that 's what I 'm saying . You can line them up based on the times ."
"[37:23] fe016 | Well , you c You you s"
[37:26] fe016 | Yeah .
"[37:26] mn017 | So the scoring program with if you give it an STM reference file ,"
"[37:30] mn017 | it will actually compare the words based on their time marks . So therefore , you can ,"
[37:33] me011 | Right .
[37:34] fe016 | Yeah .
"[37:37] me011 | Does STM do it per word , or por per utterance ?"
"[37:39] mn017 | It 's per utterance , but it it allows As long as you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference , it gives you"
[37:40] me011 | Th - what I thought .
[37:45] me011 | Alright .
[37:49] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[37:55] me011 | Within the segment . Yep .
[37:56] me011 | I see .
[37:58] mn017 | And fo for you to get a credit for it . So .
[38:01] fe008 | That sounds great .
"[38:02] mn017 | So so , it 's it should be just a straightforward re - formatting issue of the references . So ."
"[38:08] fe008 | Yeah . I mean , t y I was thinking , th the other day , that this"
[38:16] fe008 | u
[38:19] fe008 | me e e e
[38:24] fe008 | I think you 're gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac accuracy .
"[38:31] fe016 | Well , it definitely helps with , um , forced alignment , too , because ,"
"[38:44] fe016 | like , the front - end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them , that"
[38:47] fe016 | is not represented in Switchboard or
"[38:51] fe008 | Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are ."
[38:54] fe016 | Yeah .
"[38:55] fe008 | I mean , I don't know"
"[38:59] fe008 | Now , I have to I have to I really need to , uh , raise a question about the term "" cheating "" . OK ?"
"[39:05] fe008 | And the reason is , um , if I understand that ,"
"[39:15] fe008 | what my transcribers are doing and what I do , which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark"
"[39:21] fe008 | things in the data . Like the transcription , like the words that are actually there ."
[39:24] me011 | All we mean by that is that we 're giving the recognizer more information
[39:28] me011 | than it would
"[39:29] me011 | have if you were running it raw ,"
[39:31] me011 | over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed .
"[39:32] fe008 | OK . I mean , that that part is OK . But I but I do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use"
[39:47] mn017 | It 's a it 's a technical term .
[39:49] me011 | It is . Yep .
[39:51] me013 | Yeah .
"[39:51] fe016 | it 's sort of , um Because it 's so"
[39:58] me013 | I it 's i
[40:00] me013 | It 's even more than that . I think it it really gives a very strong
"[40:04] me013 | perspective , that you know"
[40:06] me013 | that what you were doing is not an un - biased experiment .
"[40:10] me013 | If you don't say that , then people think "" oh , they did that and they threw that , but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world "" ."
"[40:17] me013 | But if you say "" we did a n cheating experiment "" , which is really the standard way you 'd say it ,"
[40:21] me013 | it says you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something .
"[40:31] fe008 | OK . I guess what I 'm I 'm thinking , is just in if uh , when these are presented in an inte interdisciplinary context ,"
[40:38] fe008 | it might be nice to add that explanation ? Cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology ?
"[40:47] fe008 | the , um ,"
"[40:48] fe008 | all other approach , which is to to put those distinctions in ."
"[40:51] me013 | Maybe . I I 've heard this at ICSLP for years and years and years , though ."
"[40:54] me013 | I mean , it 's it 's pretty pretty common . People say this ."
[41:08] mn017 | But they don't run experiments .
[41:08] me013 | Yeah .
"[41:09] fe016 | Right . I 'm j Well , you can do experiments , but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box . And it 's not a very"
[41:10] fe008 | They can do experiments .
[41:20] fe016 | smart system . It it only knows what we give it .
"[41:28] fe016 | Yeah , it 's f only used in a community that"
[41:37] me013 | Yeah .
[41:41] me013 | Right .
[41:41] fe016 | You know . So she certainly can
"[41:42] me013 | Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments . Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net"
[41:45] fe016 | define it .
"[41:48] me013 | w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties ,"
"[41:51] me013 | and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were"
"[42:00] me013 | Um , and a really common error that people were making was , they were just reporting"
"[42:06] me013 | their , uh uh , classification results on the data that they were training on ."
"[42:13] me013 | it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say "" hey , I know I 'm doing something that isn't kosher "" ."
[42:21] mn017 | Hmm .
"[42:21] me013 | And to make it really clear that they knew it . So that was , I think , why why it became a popular term ."
"[42:30] me013 | But it isn't bootstrapping . Uh , it 's it 's really cheating ."
[42:32] me011 | It 's us it 's using information you wouldn't normally have . So .
"[42:35] me013 | But it 's cheating in a way that 's pril It 's it 's announcing to everybody "" hey , I 'm cheating , by doing this . """
[42:41] me013 | It 's saying so it 's all above the table . I 'm actually using this other thing .
[42:44] fe008 | OK .
[42:45] fe008 | OK . Alright .
[42:46] me013 | Bootstrapping would imply it was actually legitimate in some kind of way .
[42:49] me011 | Hmm .
[42:51] me011 | We 're not de - legitimizing the data . We 're de - legitimizing the experiment .
[42:55] me011 | We 're not saying that the data is cheating data . We 're saying th we are cheating by using this data .
[42:58] me013 | Yeah .
[43:00] fe008 | OK .
[43:01] me013 | Yeah .
[43:01] me011 | Because normally you wouldn't have that data available .
[43:01] fe008 | OK .
[43:03] fe008 | OK .
[43:04] me013 | Yeah .
[43:05] me013 | Anyway .
[43:09] fe008 | i that I can understand it in context as you described it .
"[43:14] fe008 | u um , it does import some negative evaluation , that ,"
"[43:19] fe008 | um , would maybe not be good if It has shock value , and"
[43:20] me013 | It has some shock value .
[43:22] me013 | Which is part of why it 's used .
[43:26] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[43:29] fe016 | to the wrong audie we should just explain what it what it means here , and that it 's a common term , and"
[43:38] fe008 | Yeah . Did you break the microphone ?
[43:38] fe016 | Yeah .
"[43:40] fe008 | Nnn . OK . OK . Well , I feel better now . Thank you very much ."
"[43:44] fe016 | Hmm . The first time I heard that , I I thought , you know , the same thing and I guess you ju after a while it becomes"
[43:50] me011 | It 's p it it really is part of the jargon .
"[43:54] fe016 | a humbling thing when somebody says that . If they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can't really assume that ,"
[43:56] me013 | Right .
"[44:08] fe008 | is almost resentful . It 's almost like ,"
"[44:10] fe008 | you know , resentful of the data , resentful of the , um ,"
"[44:17] me013 | No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating . I think you 're saying"
[44:20] me011 | That 's what I was saying .
[44:21] mn014 | Yeah .
"[44:21] me013 | "" in my experiment , I cheated in this way "" . I mean , another is what Liz was talking about , how"

"[44:43] me013 | And , in a sense , that was cheating ."

"[44:46] me013 | So i so it it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people "" well ,"
"[44:50] me013 | we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not"

[45:33] mn017 | Hmm .
[45:38] me013 | And so that was important to know as a baseline .

[45:44] mn017 | Hmm .
[45:45] fe008 | OK .

"[45:55] me013 | it gets very , very confusing to people ."
[45:57] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[46:08] me011 | It 's not even really negative .
[46:12] fe008 | what Adam said about it being used also for
"[46:13] fe008 | a bunch of other , uh , dimensions ."
"[46:21] me013 | And , so we we did a number of papers , and talks , and so forth about , uh w uh , i the the virtues of increasing the error rate ."
"[46:28] me013 | OK . And I mean , and the whole point of it was , not that it was good to increase your error rate , but it was good to"
[46:34] me013 | be willing
"[46:35] me013 | to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things , and trying Because there 's this notion of a local minimum , that if you just have"
[46:46] me011 | Fine - tune little bits .
[46:51] mn017 | Mmm .
[46:52] fe008 | Interesting .

"[47:51] fe016 | automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out . But we can sort of"

[48:36] fe008 | Yeah .
[48:38] me013 | Yeah .
[48:40] fe008 | Anyway .
[48:43] me013 | it 's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sounds the way it sounds to you .

"[48:51] fe008 | OK . That 's interesting . OK . Well , I wanted to raise the issue , and um ,"

"[50:08] me011 | disable the screensaver , you will see that the mike is off , but that doesn't necessarily help ."
"[50:14] fe008 | uh , whether we should screen the data before they get"
"[50:23] fe008 | and and that , I know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the ,"
[50:32] fe016 | Yeah .
[50:32] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[50:34] fe016 | I I think that 's a really good idea . Because for all kinds of studies , we"
"[50:38] fe016 | don't really enjoy meetings where some of the where the signal 's going off at times . It just makes it hard to study any kind of parameters . So ,"
"[50:46] fe016 | if there 's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all ,"
"[50:51] fe016 | it 'd be much better to go to another meeting , I think ."
[50:57] mn014 | Yeah .
"[51:01] fe008 | So , we have some part of that ."
[51:06] mn014 | Yep . Yep .
[51:08] mn014 | Yeah . Yeah .
[51:10] me011 | So .
"[51:10] fe008 | Well , there the And the other aspect of it is ,"
"[51:12] fe008 | um , that , when the microphone is not well - adjusted , then y i i"
"[51:17] fe008 | even if it 's not a lapel mike , you can get lapel mike type behavior . Cuz I 'm I 'm expecting , for example , with this , that you 're gonna end up ,"
[51:19] me011 | Right .
"[51:23] fe008 | you know , picking up other peoples ' signals ."
[51:25] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[51:26] fe008 | Yeah . I mean , it 's just you know , the microphone is"
[51:28] fe008 | intended for certain adjustments .
[51:30] fe016 | OK .
[51:34] mn014 | Hmm .
"[51:44] me011 | I mean , y d you you can do sort of a check ,"
"[51:45] fe016 | Uh , like this o"
"[51:46] me011 | but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and , um , someone not talking ."
"[51:51] me013 | Just so it doesn't when the microphone 's dead , it doesn't put out zeros ? Or ? Mm - hmm ."
[51:53] me011 | No .
[51:55] mn017 | What does it put out ?
[51:55] me001 | Really ?
[51:55] me013 | Johnson noise ? Yeah .
[51:56] fe016 | But then how are y how are you detecting during a meeting ?
[51:56] me011 | Little bit of noise .
[51:58] me011 | I use a threshold .
"[52:00] me011 | If it 's below a particular value , it it flashes yellow . So as I eh but it 's not perfect ."
[52:04] fe016 | But is it better than nothing ?
"[52:06] me011 | Yeah , probably ."
"[52:07] me011 | I mean , this is the reason why I haven't gotten back to it , is cuz my first pass at it"
[52:10] me011 | didn't really work because all the mikes have different noise levels . And so I have to do something a little more clever .
[52:13] fe016 | Right .
[52:14] mn017 | Hmm .
[52:15] me001 | It 's just the noise from the connections and the everything .
[52:17] me011 | Yep .
"[52:18] fe016 | So , you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting ,"
[52:18] me011 | Yep .
"[52:22] fe016 | in the sense that , you know , not everyone as you just said , you won't be there . And then if we find any problems , have the transcribers listen and I really think it 's"
[52:27] me011 | Yep .
[52:29] fe016 | better not to transcribe a meeting that 's gonna have problems once you 've spent all this effort .
[52:32] me011 | Yep .
[52:38] fe016 | Yeah . Yeah .
[52:42] mn017 | Mmm .
"[52:44] fe008 | uh , you know , elaborate coding of the"
[52:46] fe008 | backchannels .
"[52:47] me011 | gives you a good clue . I mean , if that is too low ,"
[52:49] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[52:50] me001 | Hmm .
[52:50] mn014 | Yeah .
"[52:51] me011 | then you can be pretty sure that it 's , uh , empty ."
"[52:53] mn014 | Yeah . Sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together , and Yeah . Yeah ."
[52:56] me011 | Right . Exactly .
"[53:07] fe008 | Well , someone who 's associated with the meeting could have , like , a summary of points handled in the meeting . You know , maybe if we could"
[53:13] fe008 | pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting 's content .
[53:16] me011 | Uh - huh .
[53:18] fe008 | Instead of losing the content altogether .
[53:19] me011 | Is there a ?
[53:24] me011 | Far - field . Yeah .
[53:30] mn017 | you know .
[53:34] fe016 | Yeah .
[53:34] mn017 | Right .
[53:36] fe016 | Yeah .
"[53:37] me011 | Well , we 'll just We 'll we 'll just have to note those ."
"[53:37] fe016 | I 'd mu We 're I 'd much rather have ,"
"[53:40] fe016 | you know , meetings that have all the channels , even if we had to skip a meeting or something , just for all these other purposes . So ."
[53:46] fe008 | And we have so many .
[53:46] me001 | You could put them at the back of the queue or something .
[53:50] me001 | Yeah .
[53:51] mn014 | Yep .
[53:51] fe016 | Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power .
[53:52] mn017 | we can afford we can a
"[53:52] fe008 | We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have"
[53:57] fe016 | Yeah .
[53:58] me011 | Do we have a ? I 'm sorry for interrupting . Do we have an EDU meeting at four ?
[53:59] fe008 | energies diverted . That 's fine .
[54:02] mn017 | Hmm .
"[54:02] fe008 | Oh , good question ."
"[54:02] fe016 | You know what ? They can their four o ' clock cancelled , and they 're starting at four twenty , and I 'll set up at four fifteen ."
[54:02] mn014 | I don't think so .
[54:05] me011 | OK . Great .
[54:06] me011 | Good .
[54:09] fe016 | Yeah .
"[54:09] me013 | There 's tea , also , though . So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh ,"
[54:10] fe008 | OK .
[54:10] fe016 | Yeah . So you 'll have si
[54:12] me013 | simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks .
[54:15] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
"[54:18] me013 | Oh , you never have ? Oh , it 's a treat ."
[54:22] mn017 | Right .
[54:23] me013 | OK .
[54:24] me011 | Everyone ready ? S reading simultaneous digits ? Three ! Two ! One !
[54:24] fe008 | Yeah .
[54:25] fe008 | Yep . Yep .
[54:28] mn017 | Sev -
"[55:09] me013 | OK , another successful babble ."

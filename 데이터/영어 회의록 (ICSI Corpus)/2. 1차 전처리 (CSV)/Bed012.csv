"[01:21] mn015 | So I guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date , Johno ."
"[01:26] mn015 | This is what , uh ,"
[01:29] me003 | This is a meeting for me .
"[01:31] mn015 | um ,"
"[01:32] mn015 | Eva ,"
"[01:35] mn015 | Bhaskara , and I did ."
[01:37] fn050 | Did you add more stuff to it ? later ?
[01:39] mn015 | Um . Why ?
[01:41] fn050 | Um .
[01:41] fn050 | I don't know .
"[01:42] fn050 | There were , like , the you know , @ @ and all that stuff . But ."
[01:44] fn050 | I thought you you said you were adding stuff but I don't know .
"[01:50] mn015 | Um ,"
[01:53] mn015 | Very nice .
"[01:55] mn015 | Um , so we thought that ,"
[01:58] mn015 | We can write up
"[01:59] mn015 | uh ,"
"[02:02] mn015 | an element ,"
[02:04] mn015 | and for each of the situation
[02:08] mn015 | nodes that we observed in the Bayes - net ?
[02:12] mn015 | So .
[02:14] mn015 | What 's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned ? if we know anything about it ? Is it under construction ?
[02:19] mn015 | Or is it
[02:20] mn015 | on fire or something happening to it ? Or is it stable ?
"[02:24] mn015 | and so forth , going all the way"
"[02:26] mn015 | um ,"
[02:27] mn015 | f
"[02:28] mn015 | through Parking ,"
"[02:29] mn015 | Location , Hotel , Car , Restroom ,"
"[02:33] mn015 | Riots , Fairs , Strikes , or"
[02:36] mn015 | Disasters .
[02:37] me003 | So is This is A situation are is all the things which can be happening right now ?
"[02:41] me003 | Or , what is the situation"
[02:43] me003 | type ?
[02:45] mn015 | That 's basically just specifying the the input for the w what 's
"[02:52] me003 | Oh , I see y Why are you specifying it in XML ?"
[02:54] mn015 | Um .
[03:00] mn015 | here ?
[03:01] me003 | OK .
"[03:02] mn015 | And , also , I mean , this is a what the input is going to be . Right ?"
"[03:09] me003 | Well , yeah . I just don't know if this is th l what the Does This is what Java Bayes takes ? as a"
[03:14] me003 | Bayes - net spec ?
[03:18] mn015 | We 're gonna get an XML document from somewhere .
[03:21] mn015 | Right ? And that XML document will say
"[03:24] mn015 | "" We are able to We were able to observe that w the element ,"
"[03:28] mn015 | um , @ @ of the Location that the car is near . """
[03:35] mn015 | Um .
"[03:36] me003 | So this is the situational context , everything in it . Is that what Situation is short for , shi situational context ?"
[03:41] mn015 | Yep .
[03:42] me003 | OK .
"[03:44] mn015 | So this is just ,"
"[03:45] mn015 | again , a an XML schemata which defines a set of possible , uh , permissible XML"
"[03:51] mn015 | structures ,"
[03:52] mn015 | which we view as input into the Bayes - net .
[03:58] mn015 | Right ?
[03:58] me003 | And then we can r uh
[04:00] me003 | possibly run one of them uh
[04:03] me003 | transformations ?
[04:04] me003 | That put it into the format that the Bayes n or Java Bayes or whatever wants ?
[04:07] mn015 | Yea - Are you talking are you talking about the the structure ?
[04:13] mn015 | I mean when you observe a node .
[04:18] mn015 | Um - hmm .
"[04:18] me003 | it takes a certain format , right ?"
[04:20] me003 | Which I don't think is this .
[04:21] me003 | Although I don't know .
"[04:23] mn015 | No , it 's certainly not this ."
[04:27] mn015 | XSL . Yeah .
[04:29] me003 | To convert it into the Java Bayes for format ?
[04:31] mn015 | Yep .
[04:32] me003 | OK .
"[04:34] mn015 | That 's no problem , but"
"[04:45] mn015 | You wanna say , "" OK , give me the posterior probabilities of the Go - there node ,"
"[04:51] mn015 | when this is happening . """
"[04:53] mn015 | Right ? When the person said this , the car is there , it 's raining , and this is happening ."
"[04:59] mn015 | And with this you can specify the what 's happening in the situation , and what 's happening"
[05:04] mn015 | with the user .
"[05:07] mn015 | After we are done , through the Situation we get the User Vector ."
[05:14] me003 | So this is just a specification of all the possible inputs ?
[05:17] mn015 | Yep .
"[05:18] mn015 | And ,"
"[05:20] mn015 | all the possible outputs , too ."
[05:23] me003 | OK .
"[05:23] mn015 | So , we have , um ,"
"[05:26] mn015 | for example , the , uh , Go - there decision node"
[05:30] mn015 | which has two
"[05:32] mn015 | elements , going - there"
"[05:34] mn015 | and its posterior probability ,"
"[05:37] mn015 | and not - going - there and its posterior probability ,"
[05:42] mn015 | because the output is always gonna be
[05:45] mn015 | all the decision nodes and all the the a all the posterior probabilities for all the values .
"[05:58] me003 | So like , if I 'm just interested in the going - there node ,"
[06:01] me003 | I would just pull that information out of the Struct
[06:04] me003 | that gets return that would that Java Bayes would output ?
"[06:09] mn015 | Um ,"
"[06:11] mn015 | pretty much , yes , but"
[06:12] mn015 | I think it 's a little bit more complex .
"[06:17] mn015 | As , if I understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes ."
"[06:25] mn015 | So , when we"
"[06:27] mn015 | input something ,"
"[06:30] mn015 | we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these . Right ?"
[06:34] me003 | OK .
[06:35] mn015 | So there is no way of telling it t
[06:37] mn015 | not to tell us about the EVA values .
"[06:40] me003 | Yeah , wait I agree , that 's yeah , use oh , uh Yeah , OK ."
[06:43] mn015 | So so we get this whole
"[06:46] mn015 | list of of , um ,"
"[06:50] mn015 | things , and the question is"
"[06:53] mn015 | what to do with it ,"
"[06:55] mn015 | what to hand on ,"
"[06:56] mn015 | how to interpret it ,"
[06:58] mn015 | in a sense .
"[07:00] mn015 | So y you said if you "" I 'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not "" , then I just look at that node ,"
"[07:06] me003 | Look at that Struct in the output , right ?"
[07:08] mn015 | Yep .
"[07:09] mn015 | Look at that Struct in the the output , even though"
"[07:12] mn015 | I wouldn't call it a "" Struct "" . But ."
"[07:14] me003 | Well i well , it 's an XML Structure that 's being res returned , right ?"
[07:16] mn015 | Oh . Mm - hmm .
"[07:18] mn015 | So every part of a structure is a "" Struct "" ."
[07:21] mn015 | Yeah .
"[07:22] me003 | Yeah , I just uh I just was abbreviated it"
"[07:24] me003 | to Struct in my head , and"
[07:26] me003 | started going with that .
"[07:28] mn015 | That element or object ,"
[07:30] mn015 | I would say .
[07:30] me003 | Not a C Struct . That 's not what I was trying to k though yeah .
[07:31] mn015 | Yeah .
[07:34] mn015 | OK .
"[07:34] mn015 | And , um ,"
[07:47] mn015 | Um .
[07:50] mn015 | So .
[07:54] mn015 | Let 's look at an example .
"[07:57] me003 | Well , w wouldn't we just take the structure that 's outputted"
"[08:01] me003 | and then run another transformation on it , that would just dump the one that we wanted out ?"
[08:09] mn015 | Yeah . w We 'd need to prune .
[08:11] mn015 | Right ?
[08:13] mn015 | Throw things away .
[08:20] mn015 | Xerxes
"[08:22] mn015 | allows you to say , u "" Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . """
"[08:26] mn015 | But , we don't really know what we 're interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result ."
"[08:33] mn015 | So the person said ,"
"[08:35] mn015 | um ,"
"[08:36] mn015 | "" Where is X ? "" and so ,"
"[08:40] mn015 | we want to know ,"
"[08:41] mn015 | um ,"
[08:42] mn015 | is Does he want
[08:46] mn015 | info ?
[08:47] mn015 | o on this ? or know the location ?
[08:51] mn015 | Or does he want to go there ?
[08:55] mn015 | Let 's assume this is our our question .
[08:57] me003 | Sure .
[08:59] mn015 | So .
[09:02] mn015 | Um .
[10:01] mn015 | OK .
[10:17] mn015 | Let 's assume this is the output .
[10:21] mn015 | So .
[10:26] mn015 | I mean . It 's always gonna give us a value of
"[10:29] mn015 | how likely we think i it is that he wants to go there and doesn't want to go there ,"
[10:34] mn015 | or how likely it is that he wants to
[10:36] mn015 | get information .
"[10:38] mn015 | But , maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate ."
"[10:44] mn015 | So , does he wanna know where it is ? or does he wanna go there ?"
[10:53] me003 | He wants to know where it is .
[10:59] mn015 | Right .
"[11:04] mn015 | And i if there 's sort of a clear winner here ,"
"[11:13] mn015 | indifferent ,"
[11:23] mn015 | then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to
"[11:27] mn015 | just know where , uh t uh , he does want to go there ."
"[11:31] me003 | Uh , out of curiosity , is there a reason why we wouldn't"
[11:34] me003 | combine
[11:37] me003 | these three nodes ?
[11:41] me003 | that would just
"[11:44] me003 | the question for We have "" where is X ? "" is the question , right ? That would just be Info - on or Location ?"
"[11:52] mn015 | Or Go - there . A lot of people ask that , if they actually just wanna go there ."
"[11:57] mn015 | People come up to you on campus and say , "" Where 's the library ? """
"[11:59] mn015 | You 're gonna say y you 're gonna say , g "" Go down that way . """
"[12:06] mn015 | "" it 's located """
"[12:06] me003 | Well , I mean But the there 's So you just have three"
"[12:10] me003 | decisions for the final node , that would link thes these three nodes in the net together ."
[12:15] mn015 | Um .
"[12:22] mn015 | Given this input , we , also in some situations , may wanna"
[12:27] mn015 | postulate an opinion whether
[12:29] mn015 | that person wants to go there now
"[12:31] mn015 | the nicest way , use a cab , or so s"
"[12:35] mn015 | wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there , because he wants to"
[12:41] mn015 | visit t it or whatever .
"[12:44] mn015 | So , it n I mean a All I 'm saying is ,"
"[12:47] mn015 | whatever our input is , we 're always gonna get the full"
[12:50] mn015 | output .
[12:54] mn015 | some things
[12:56] mn015 | will always be sort of
[12:59] mn015 | too not significant enough .
[12:59] me003 | Wha -
"[13:01] me003 | Or i or i it 'll be tight . You won't it 'll be hard to decide . But I mean , I guess I guess the thing is ,"
[13:03] mn015 | Yep .
"[13:07] me003 | uh ,"
"[13:08] me003 | this is another , smaller , case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty , which makes me think Bayes - net should be"
[13:13] me003 | the way to solve
"[13:15] me003 | these things . So if you had If for every construction , right ?"
[13:17] mn015 | Oh !
"[13:18] me003 | you could say , "" Well , there Here 's the Where - Is construction . """
"[13:20] me003 | And for the Where - Is construction , we know we need to l look at this node ,"
[13:24] me003 | that merges these three things together
[13:25] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:26] me003 | as for th to decide the response . And since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with , we could have a finite number of nodes ."
[13:32] mn015 | OK .
"[13:34] me003 | Say , if we had to y deal with arbitrary language , it wouldn't make any sense to do that , because"
[13:34] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[13:38] me003 | there 'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence .
[13:41] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[13:44] mn015 | So , basically , the idea is to f"
[13:47] mn015 | to feed the output of that
[13:48] mn015 | belief - net into another belief - net .
"[13:50] me003 | Yeah , so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief - net ."
"[13:53] mn015 | But , why why why only those three ? Why not the whol"
"[13:56] me003 | Well , I mean , d For the Where - Is question ."
[13:58] me003 | So we 'd have a node for the Where - Is question .
"[14:02] mn015 | Yeah . But we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the Where - Is ,"
[14:07] mn015 | and the Where How - do - I - get - to or the Tell - me - something - about .
[14:16] me003 | You can come in if you want .
"[14:19] mn015 | Yes , it is allowed ."
[14:20] me003 | As long as y you 're not wearing your h your h headphones .
[14:23] me012 | Alright . Just a second . I 'll be back .
"[14:29] me003 | Well , I do I See , I don't know if this is a good idea or not . I 'm just throwing it out ."
[14:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[14:40] me003 | into the Where - Is node answer
[14:44] mn015 | Yep .
[14:45] me003 | node
[14:45] me003 | thing
[14:47] me003 | stuff .
"[14:54] mn015 | Let 's not forget we 're gonna get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse things , right ?"
[15:02] mn015 | So .
"[15:03] mn015 | "" Tell me the location of X . """
[15:06] mn015 | Nuh ?
"[15:07] mn015 | Or "" Where is X located"
[15:09] me003 | We u
"[15:13] me003 | on the nodes in the Bayes - net would be able to do all that , wouldn't it ?"
[15:15] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[15:17] me003 | Here 's a k
"[15:20] me003 | Oh , I 'll wait until you 're plugged in ."
"[15:22] me003 | Oh , don't sit there . Sit here ."

"[15:26] me012 | Oh , do I not ?"
[15:27] me003 | That 's the weird one .
[15:29] me003 | That 's the one that 's painful . That hurts . It hurts so bad .
[15:35] me003 | I 'm h I 'm happy that they 're recording that .
"[15:38] me003 | That headphone . The headphone that you have to put on backwards , with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it ?"

"[20:37] mn015 | "" Uh , go there , Timing , now . """
"[20:39] mn015 | Or , "" The winner is Info - on ,"
"[20:42] mn015 | Function - Off . """
"[20:44] mn015 | So , he wants to know something about it , and what it does ."
[20:48] mn015 | Nuh ?
"[20:50] mn015 | Uh , regardless of of of the input . Wh - Regardle -"
"[20:52] me003 | Yeah , but"
[20:53] me003 | But how does the expert but how does the expert system
"[20:56] me003 | know how who which one to declare the winner , if it doesn't know the question it is , and how that question should be answered ?"
"[21:05] mn015 | Based on the k what the question was , so what the discourse , the ontology , the situation and the user model gave us , we came up with these values for these decisions ."
[21:14] me003 | Yeah I know . But how do we weight what we get out ?
"[21:19] me003 | As , which one i Which ones are important ?"
"[21:29] me003 | for every question that we knew how to deal with ,"
[21:32] me003 | that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question .
[21:36] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[21:38] me003 | Does that make sense ?
"[21:40] me003 | Yay , nay ?"
"[21:41] me012 | Um , I mean , are you saying that , what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation , or are we just dealing with arbitrary language ?"
[21:47] me012 | Is that your point ?
"[21:49] me003 | Well , no . I I guess my question is ,"
"[21:51] me003 | Is the reason that we can make a node f or OK . So , lemme"
[22:00] me003 | Every construction .
"[22:05] me012 | I don't Not necessarily , I would think . I mean , it 's not based on constructions , it 's based on things like , uh , there 's gonna be a node for Go - there or not , and there 's gonna be a node for Enter , View , Approach ."
[22:12] me003 | Wel -
[22:15] me003 | W OK .
"[22:16] me003 | So , someone asked a question ."
[22:18] me012 | Yeah .
[22:19] me003 | How do we decide
[22:20] me003 | how to answer it ?
[22:30] mn015 | You 'll have y This is what you get .
[22:32] mn015 | And now you have to make a decision . What do we think ?
[22:35] mn015 | What does this tell us ?
"[22:37] mn015 | And not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local , because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these"
[22:48] mn015 | posterior probabilities .
"[22:51] mn015 | What what we need is a just a mechanism that says ,"
"[22:54] mn015 | "" Aha !"
"[22:55] mn015 | There is """
"[23:01] me012 | I mean , in general , like , we won't just have those three , right ? We 'll have , uh , like , many , many nodes ."
[23:06] mn015 | Yep .
"[23:06] me012 | So we have to , like So that it 's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say ."
"[23:12] mn015 | Because there are interdependencies , right ?"
"[23:17] mn015 | Uh , no . So if if"
"[23:19] mn015 | for example , the Go - there posterior possibility is so high , um ,"
"[23:25] mn015 | uh , w if it 's if it has reached reached a certain height , then"
[23:28] mn015 | all of this becomes irrelevant . So . If even if if the function or the history or something is
[23:38] me003 | Wel -
[23:43] mn015 | He wants to go there and know something about it ?
[23:43] me003 | Do they have to be mutual
[23:45] me003 | Yeah . Do they have to be mutually exclusive ?
[23:47] mn015 | I think to some extent they are .
[23:52] mn015 | Or maybe they 're not .
"[23:54] me003 | Cuz I , uh The way you describe what they meant , they weren't mutu uh , they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me ."
"[24:01] mn015 | Well , if he doesn't want to go there ,"
[24:03] mn015 | even if the Enter
[24:05] mn015 | posterior proba So .
[24:08] mn015 | Go - there is No .
"[24:10] mn015 | Enter is High , and Info - on is High ."
[24:14] mn015 | Hmm ?
[24:14] me003 | those three nodes . The - d They didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive .
"[24:19] me003 | So th s so , yeah , but some So , some things would drop out , and some things would still be important ."
[24:23] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:31] me003 | But I guess what 's confusing me is , if we have a Bayes - net to deal w another Bayes - net to deal with this stuff ,"
[24:37] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[24:38] me003 | you know ,"
"[24:40] me003 | uh ,"
"[24:41] me003 | is the only reason OK , so ,"
"[24:43] me003 | I guess ,"
[24:48] me003 | we can design it is cuz we know
[24:50] me003 | what each question is asking ?
[24:53] me012 | Yeah .
[24:54] me012 | I think that 's true .
"[24:56] me003 | And then , so , the only reason way we would know what question he 's asking is based upon Oh , so if Let 's say I had a construction parser , and I plug this in , I would know what each construction the communicative"
[25:04] me003 | intent of the construction was
[25:06] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:06] me003 | and so then I would know how to weight the nodes appropriately , in response ."
"[25:11] me003 | So no matter what they said , if I could map it onto a Where - Is construction ,"
[25:12] me012 | Ge -
[25:14] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:15] me003 | I could say , "" ah !"
"[25:16] me003 | well the the intent , here , was Where - Is "" ,"
"[25:17] me012 | OK , right ."
[25:18] me003 | and I could look at those .
[25:20] me012 | Yeah .
"[25:22] me012 | Yes , I mean . Sure . You do need to know I mean , to have that kind of information ."
[25:31] mn015 | Hmm .
"[25:31] mn015 | Yeah , I 'm also agreeing that a simple"
[25:35] mn015 | Take the ones where we have a clear winner .
[25:39] mn015 | Forget about the ones where it 's all sort of
[25:41] mn015 | middle ground .
[25:43] mn015 | Prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner .
"[25:47] mn015 | Yeah , because that would be the easiest way ."
[25:49] mn015 | We just compose as an output an XML mes message that says .
"[25:54] mn015 | "" Go there now . """
"[25:56] mn015 | "" Enter"
"[26:00] mn015 | historical information . """
[26:02] mn015 | And not care whether that 's consistent with anything .
[26:05] mn015 | Right ?
"[26:06] mn015 | But in this case if we say , "" definitely he doesn't want to go there . He just wants to know"
"[26:11] mn015 | where it is . """
"[26:16] mn015 | He wants to know something about the history of . So he said ,"
"[26:19] mn015 | "" Tell me something about the history of that . """
"[26:21] mn015 | Now , the e But for some reason the Endpoint - Approach"
"[26:27] mn015 | gets a really high score , too ."
[26:38] mn015 | Somebody needs to zap that .
[26:41] mn015 | You know ?
[26:42] mn015 | Or
"[26:55] me003 | So then ,"
[26:56] me003 | the Bayes - net that would merge
"[26:58] me003 | there , that would make the decision between Go - there , Info - on , and Location ,"
"[27:01] me003 | would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted , and based upon that node , then you would look at the other stuff ."
[27:06] mn015 | Yep .
"[27:09] me003 | I mean , it i"
[27:09] mn015 | Yep .
[27:10] me003 | Does that make sense ?
"[27:11] mn015 | Yep . It 's sort of one of those , that 's It 's more like a decision tree ,"
[27:15] mn015 | if if you want .
"[27:18] me003 | Yeah , i"
"[27:20] me003 | Yeah , I didn't intend to say that every possible OK ."
"[27:22] me003 | There was a confusion there , k I didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the Bayes - net , because some of the things aren't relevant in the Bayes - net"
[27:27] me003 | for a specific question .
[27:31] me003 | Like the Endpoint
[27:33] me003 | is not necessarily relevant in the Bayes - net for Where - Is until after you 've decided whether you wanna go there or not .
[27:38] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[27:39] me012 | Right .
"[27:43] me003 | Show us the way , Bhaskara ."
"[27:50] me012 | Like , if you 're asked a Where - Is question , you may not even look like , ask for the posterior probability of the , uh , EVA node , right ?"
"[27:57] me012 | Cuz , that 's what I mean , in the Bayes - net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node . So , I mean ,"
[28:02] me012 | you may not even bother to compute things you don't need .
[28:02] mn015 | Um .
[28:06] mn015 | Aren't we always computing all ?
[28:07] me012 | No .
"[28:08] me012 | You can compute , uh , the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes , given"
"[28:12] me012 | some other nodes , but"
"[28:14] me012 | totally ignore some other nodes , also ."
"[28:16] me012 | Basically , things you ignore get marginalized over ."
"[28:18] mn015 | Yeah , but that 's that 's just shifting the problem ."
"[28:21] mn015 | Then you would have to make a decision , "" OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which"
[28:24] me012 | Yeah .
"[28:24] mn015 | decision nodes do I query ? """
[28:26] me012 | Yes .
[28:28] me012 | But I would think that 's what you want to do . Right ?
"[28:32] fn050 | Well , eventually , you still have to pick out which ones you look at . So it 's pretty much the same problem , isn't it ?"
[28:34] mn015 | Yeah .
[28:36] mn015 | Yeah it 's it 's it 's apples and oranges . Nuh ?
"[28:40] mn015 | I mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance ,"
[28:44] mn015 | computational time . So either you
[28:45] me012 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:45] mn015 | always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes , and then prune"
[28:50] me012 | Mmm .
[28:51] mn015 | the ones you think that are
"[28:53] mn015 | irrelevant ,"
[28:54] mn015 | or you just make a p
[28:57] mn015 | a priori
[28:58] mn015 | estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those .
[29:02] me012 | Yeah .
"[29:20] me003 | So basically , you 'd have a decision tree query , Go - there ."
"[29:35] me003 | Well , in the case of Go - there , it would be . In the case Cuz if you needed an If y If Go - there was true , you 'd wanna know what endpoint"
"[29:40] me003 | was . And if it was false , you 'd wanna d look at"
[29:42] me003 | either Lo - Income Info - on or History .
[29:46] me012 | Yeah .
"[29:48] me012 | That 's true , I guess . Yeah , so , in a way you would have that ."
"[30:00] me003 | Also , I 'm somewhat boggled by that Hugin software ."
"[30:03] me012 | OK , why 's that ?"
[30:04] me003 | I can't figure out how to get the
[30:07] me003 | probabilities into it .
[30:10] me012 | Mm - hmm .
[30:10] me003 | It 's somewha It 's boggling me .
[30:12] me012 | OK .
[30:14] me012 | Alright .
"[30:15] me012 | Well , hopefully it 's fixable ."
[30:16] me003 | Ju -
"[30:17] me003 | Oh yeah , yeah . I d I just think I haven't"
"[30:19] me003 | figured out what the terms in Hugin mean , versus what Java Bayes terms are ."
[30:23] me012 | OK .
[30:26] me012 | So we can figure this out .
"[30:30] me012 | They should come when they 're done their stuff , basically , whenever that is ."
[30:34] me012 | So .
"[30:37] me012 | Um ,"
"[30:38] me012 | I guess ,"
"[30:39] me012 | Jerry needs to enter marks , but I don't know if he 's gonna do that now or later ."
"[30:42] me012 | But , uh , if he 's gonna enter marks , it 's gonna take him awhile , I guess , and he won't be here ."
[30:46] me003 | And what 's Nancy doing ?
"[30:48] me012 | Nancy ? Um , she was sorta finishing up the , uh ,"
"[30:51] me012 | calculation of marks and assigning of grades , but I don't know if she should be here ."
[30:59] me012 | assuming she 's coming to this meeting .
[31:02] me012 | I don't know if she knows about it .
"[31:06] me003 | She 's on the email list , right ?"
[31:07] me012 | Is she ? OK .
[31:11] mn015 | OK .
"[31:17] mn015 | where we also have decided , prior to"
[31:21] mn015 | this meeting is that
[31:26] fn050 | OK .
[31:29] me012 | OK .
"[31:30] mn015 | and finish up the , uh , values"
[31:33] mn015 | of
[31:35] mn015 | this .
"[31:36] mn015 | So we have ,"
[31:46] mn015 | Yep .
[31:47] fn050 | OK .
[31:47] mn015 | We we we have Actually what we have is this line .
[31:52] mn015 | Right ?
"[31:52] me003 | Uh , what do the , uh ,"
[31:54] me003 | structures
[31:55] mn015 | Hmm ?
"[31:56] me003 | For instance , this Location node 's got two inputs ,"
[31:59] me012 | Four inputs .
[31:59] mn015 | Hmm .
"[32:00] me012 | Those are The bottom things are inputs , also ."
[32:03] me012 | Yeah .
"[32:05] me003 | OK , that was"
[32:06] me003 | OK .
[32:06] me003 | That makes a lot more sense to me now .
"[32:08] me003 | Cuz I thought it was like , that"
[32:10] me003 | one in
"[32:11] me003 | Stuart 's book about ,"
[32:14] me012 | Alarm in the dog ?
[32:15] me003 | U Yeah .
[32:16] me003 | Or the earthquake and the alarm .
"[32:19] me003 | Yeah , there 's a dog one , too , but that 's in Java Bayes , isn't it ?"
[32:21] me012 | Right .
[32:22] me012 | Maybe .
[32:22] me003 | But there 's something about
[32:23] me003 | bowel problems or something with the dog .
[32:27] mn015 | And we have all the
"[32:31] mn015 | top ones ,"
"[32:38] mn015 | these , where arrows are pointing , where we 're combining"
[32:43] mn015 | top ones .
"[32:46] mn015 | So , we have to come up with values for this , and"
[32:53] mn015 | And maybe
"[33:00] mn015 | And , um ."
"[33:02] mn015 | And then it 's just , uh ,"
"[33:04] mn015 | edges ,"
[33:06] mn015 | many of
"[33:11] mn015 | And , um , we won't meet next Monday ."
[33:17] mn015 | So .
[33:18] me003 | Cuz of Memorial Day ?
[33:20] mn015 | Yep .
"[33:20] me012 | We 'll meet next Tuesday , I guess ."
[33:22] mn015 | Yeah .
[33:26] me012 | Which Friday ?
[33:26] mn015 | This this Friday .
[33:27] me012 | OK .
[33:27] fn050 | Oh . This Friday ?
[33:29] mn015 | This Friday .
"[33:29] me003 | As in , four days ?"
[33:30] mn015 | Yep .
"[33:31] me003 | Or , three days ?"
[33:32] me012 | Is he How long is he gone for ?
[33:34] mn015 | Two weeks .
"[33:39] me012 | What 's , uh what 's there ?"
"[33:44] mn015 | Well , it 's a country ."
[33:46] mn015 | Buildings .
[33:47] mn015 | People .
[33:48] me003 | But it 's not a conference or anything . He 's just visiting .
[33:48] me012 | Pasta .
[33:49] mn015 | Hmm ?
[33:50] me012 | Right .
[33:51] me012 | Just visiting .
[33:52] mn015 | Vacation .
"[33:57] me012 | It 's a pretty nice place ,"
"[33:59] me012 | in my brief , uh , encounter with it ."
"[34:01] mn015 | Do you guys Oh , yeah . So . Part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back ."
"[34:09] me003 | Oh , I think we should disappoint him ."
[34:18] me003 | I think w we should do absolutely no work
[34:20] me003 | for the two weeks that he 's gone .
"[34:22] mn015 | Well , that 's actually what I had planned , personally . I had I I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work , and I do nothing ."
"[34:30] me003 | Oh , yeah , that sounds good , too ."
[34:32] mn015 | sort of bask in in your glory .
"[34:39] mn015 | But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans , because I myself am going to be ,"
"[34:43] mn015 | um ,"
"[34:45] mn015 | gone , but"
[34:46] mn015 | this is actually not really important . Just this weekend we 're going camping .
[34:53] mn015 | But we 're all going to be here on Tuesday again ?
[34:56] mn015 | Looks like it ?
[34:56] fn050 | Yeah .
"[34:58] mn015 | OK , then . Let 's meet meet again next Tuesday ."
"[35:01] mn015 | And , um ,"
[35:02] mn015 | finish up this Bayes - net .
"[35:05] mn015 | And once we have finished it ,"
"[35:07] mn015 | I guess we can ,"
"[35:11] mn015 | and that 's going to be more just you and me ,"
"[35:14] mn015 | because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic ,"
"[35:17] mn015 | recursive ,"
"[35:18] mn015 | structured ,"
"[35:20] mn015 | object - oriented ,"
"[35:22] mn015 | uh ,"
[35:25] mn015 | reasoning machines .
[35:26] me012 | Yes .
"[35:28] me003 | Killing , reasoning . What 's the difference ?"
"[35:30] fn050 | Wait . So you 're saying , next Tuesday , is it the whole group meeting , or just"
[35:34] mn015 | Uh .
[35:35] mn015 | The whole group .
"[35:37] mn015 | And we present our results ,"
"[35:38] mn015 | our final ,"
[35:39] fn050 | OK .
"[35:41] fn050 | So , when you were saying we need to do a re - run"
[35:44] me012 | h What ?
[35:48] mn015 | Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days .
[35:50] fn050 | This week ?
"[35:51] mn015 | So , this week , yeah ."
[35:51] fn050 | OK .
"[35:54] me003 | the four of us , and Keith ?"
"[35:57] me003 | Ami might be here , and it 's possible that Nancy 'll be here ?"
[36:00] mn015 | Yep .
"[36:06] me003 | So ,"
[36:08] me003 | yeah .
"[36:10] mn015 | Because , th you know ,"
[36:12] me003 | You 're just gonna have to
"[36:13] me003 | explain it to me , then , on Tuesday , how it 's all gonna work out ."
[36:16] me003 | You know .
[36:21] mn015 | We will .
"[36:22] mn015 | OK . Because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know ,"
"[36:27] mn015 | defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it , and then"
[36:31] mn015 | hook it up to some
[36:33] mn015 | fake construction
[36:36] me003 | That you will have in about
[36:37] me003 | nine months or so . Yeah .
[36:38] mn015 | Yeah .
"[36:40] mn015 | And , um ,"
[36:41] me003 | The first bad version 'll be done in nine months .
"[36:44] mn015 | Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface and you can Keith can worry about the discourse . I mean , this is pretty Um , I mean , I I I hope everybody uh knows that"
"[36:54] mn015 | these are just going to be uh dummy values , right ?"
[36:59] me012 | Which ones ?
"[37:00] mn015 | S so so if the endpoint if the Go - there is Yes and No , then Go - there - discourse will just be fifty - fifty ."
[37:07] mn015 | Right ?
[37:09] fn050 | I don't get it .
[37:11] me012 | I don't u understand .
[37:15] mn015 | Um .
"[37:16] me012 | Like , the Go - there depends on all those four things ."
[37:19] mn015 | Yep .
[37:19] me012 | Yeah .
"[37:19] mn015 | But , what are the values of the Go - there - discourse ?"
"[37:25] mn015 | Yeah , but , uh , we have no discourse input ."
"[37:28] me012 | Oh , I see . The d See , uh , specifically in our situation , D and O are gonna be , uh Yeah . Sure . So , whatever ."
[37:35] fn050 | Is that what the Keith node is ?
[37:37] mn015 | Yep .
"[37:40] mn015 | Well , this is"
"[37:42] mn015 | OK , this , I can I can get it in here ."
"[37:45] mn015 | I can get it in here , so th We have the , uh ,"
"[37:48] mn015 | um ,"
"[37:51] mn015 | sk let 's let 's call it "" Keith - Johno"
"[37:57] mn015 | node "" ."
[37:58] mn015 | There is
[38:00] mn015 | somewhere printed .
[38:01] me003 | There you go .
[38:02] me012 | Yeah . People have the same problem with my name .
"[38:06] mn015 | And , um ,"
[38:12] me003 | Yeah .
"[38:15] me003 | Cuz you kn When you said people have the same problem , I thought Cuz my H goes after the uh e e e the v"
[38:18] me012 | People have the inverse problem with my name .
[38:19] me003 | OK .
"[38:21] me003 | I always have to check ,"
"[38:23] me003 | a past email of yours , to make sure I 'm spelling your name correctly ."
[38:28] me012 | That 's good .
[38:29] me003 | I worry about you .
[38:31] me012 | I appreciate that .
"[38:34] mn015 | But , when you abbreviate yourself as the "" Basman "" , you don't use any H 's ."
"[38:38] me012 | "" Basman "" ? Yeah , it 's because of the chessplayer named Michael Basman , who is my hero ."
[38:43] mn015 | OK .
[38:45] me003 | You 're a geek .
[38:50] me003 | How do you pronou
[38:50] mn015 | OK .
[38:51] me003 | How do you pronounce your name ?
[38:53] fn050 | Yeah .
[38:53] me012 | Not Eva ?
[38:54] me003 | What if I were What if I were to call you Eva ?
[38:57] fn050 | I 'd probably still respond to it .
"[38:59] fn050 | I 've had people call me Eva , but I don't know ."
"[39:02] me003 | No , not just Eva , Eva . Like if I u"
[39:05] me003 | take the V and s pronounce it like it was a German V ?
[39:09] mn015 | Which is F .
[39:10] me003 | Yeah .
"[39:11] fn050 | Um , no idea then ."
[39:13] mn015 | Voiced .
[39:15] fn050 | What ?
[39:18] fn050 | OK .
"[39:19] mn015 | Well , it 's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced ."
[39:21] me003 | Yeah .
[39:21] fn050 | OK .
"[39:28] me003 | As long as that 's O K . I mean , I might slip out and say it accidentally . That 's all I 'm saying ."
[39:28] fn050 | Um .
"[39:34] me012 | Yeah . It doesn't matter what those nodes are , anyway , because we 'll just make the weights "" zero "" for now ."
[39:38] mn015 | Yep .
"[39:39] mn015 | We 'll make them zero for now ,"
"[39:41] mn015 | because it who who knows what they come up with ,"
[39:44] mn015 | what 's gonna come in there .
[39:47] mn015 | OK .
"[39:48] mn015 | And , um ,"
[39:53] mn015 | then
[39:58] mn015 | should we start on Thursday ?
[40:02] me012 | OK .
[40:02] mn015 | And not meet tomorrow ?
[40:05] me012 | Sure .
[40:12] mn015 | OK .
"[40:14] mn015 | I 'll send an email ,"
[40:16] mn015 | make a time suggestion .
[40:19] me003 | that that we can that we have one node per construction .
"[40:22] me003 | Cuz even in people , like , they don't know what you 're talking about if you 're using some sort of strange construction ."
"[40:28] mn015 | Yeah , they would still c sort of get the closest , best fit ."
"[40:32] me003 | Well , yeah , but I mean , the uh , I mean , that 's what the construction parser would do . Uh , I mean , if you said something completely arbitrary , it would f find the"
[40:35] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[40:38] mn015 | OK .
"[40:42] me003 | But if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever ,"
[40:45] me003 | n people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about .
[40:47] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:48] me003 | Like "" Bus dog fried egg . "" I mean ."
[40:51] me003 | You know .
"[40:52] mn015 | Or , if even something Chinese , for example ."
"[40:54] me003 | Or , something in Mandarin , yeah ."
"[40:56] me003 | Or Cantonese , as the case may be ."
"[41:02] me003 | What do you think about that , Bhaskara ?"
[41:10] me012 | nodes for ?
"[41:13] me003 | In this system , or in r"
"[41:14] me012 | No , we . Like , when people do this kind of thing ."
"[41:16] me003 | Oh , when p How many constructions do people have ?"
[41:18] me012 | Yeah .
"[41:20] me012 | Is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very , uh , sort of s abstract things ?"
[41:23] me003 | Every noun is a construction .
"[41:25] me012 | OK , so it 's like in the thousands ."
"[41:27] me003 | Any any form - meaning pair , to my understanding , is a construction ."
[41:30] me012 | OK .
[41:31] mn015 | So .
"[41:31] me003 | And form u starts at the level of noun Or actually , maybe even sounds . Yeah ."
[41:35] mn015 | Phoneme . Yep .
[41:36] me003 | And goes upwards
[41:39] me003 | until you get
[41:40] me003 | the ditransitive construction .
[41:41] me012 | S
[41:43] me003 | Can there be combinations of the dit
[41:45] me012 | constructions .
"[41:47] me003 | The "" giving a speech "" construction ,"
[41:49] mn015 | Rhetorical constructions . Yeah .
[41:51] me012 | Yes .
"[41:58] mn015 | But , I mean ,"
[42:02] mn015 | count the ways .
[42:03] mn015 | I mean .
"[42:03] me003 | It 's probab Yeah , I would s definitely say it 's finite ."
[42:05] mn015 | Yeah .
"[42:05] me003 | And at least in compilers , that 's all that really matters , as long as your analysis is finite ."
"[42:11] me012 | How 's that ? How it can be finite , again ?"
"[42:14] me003 | Nah , I can't think of a way it would be infinite ."
"[42:17] mn015 | Well , you can come up with new constructions ."
"[42:20] me003 | If the if your if your brain was totally non - deterministic ,"
"[42:24] me003 | then perhaps there 's a way to get , uh ,"
[42:26] me003 | infin an infinite number of constructions that you 'd have to worry about .
"[42:30] me012 | But , I mean , in the practical sense , it 's impossible ."
[42:34] me012 | Yeah .
"[42:39] me003 | So the best - case scenario would be the number of constructions or , the worst - case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons ."
"[42:44] me012 | Well , two to the power of the number of neurons ."
[42:45] me003 | Right .
[42:47] me003 | But still
[42:48] me003 | finite .
[42:56] mn015 | OK .
"[42:57] me003 | No , wait . Not necessarily , is it ?"
[43:04] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:05] me003 | lots of different neurons , to specify different values ?"
"[43:13] me003 | There 's a bandwidth issue , right ? Yeah ."
"[43:14] me012 | Bandw - Yeah , so you can't do better than something ."

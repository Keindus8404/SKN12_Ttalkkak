[00:04] fe004 | Sorry .
[00:21] fe004 | Mental mental Palm Pilot .
[00:28] fe004 | Hence no problem .
"[00:39] fn050 | Her . Nope . Doesn't seem to be , yeah ."
[00:41] fe004 | Hello I 'm channel one .
[00:42] mn015 | What does your thing say on the back ?
"[00:44] fn050 | Nnn , five ."
"[00:48] me003 | Sibilance . Three , three ."
[00:53] fe004 | Eh .
"[00:54] me003 | See , that matches the seat up there . So ."
[01:02] me003 | That starts counting from zero and these start counting from one .
[01:12] fe004 | But mine is correct .
[01:15] fe004 | It 's one .
[01:16] fe004 | Channel one .
"[01:18] fe004 | Oh , oh , oh !"
[01:24] fe004 | But your p
"[01:25] fe004 | No , but the paper 's correct ."
[01:26] me003 | The paper is correct .
[01:27] fe004 | Look at the paper .
"[01:28] me003 | I didn't det I was saying the microphone , not the paper ."
[01:30] me010 | it 's n
[01:30] fe004 | Oh .
[01:32] me010 | It 's always offset . Yeah .
[01:32] fe004 | OK .
"[01:33] fe004 | Yes , you 've bested me again . That 's how I think of our continuing interaction . Damn ! Foiled again !"
[01:46] fe004 | He 'll probably come later .
[01:48] me010 | He - he he 's
[01:48] me003 | from that ?
"[01:49] me010 | probably not , is my guess ."
"[01:52] me003 | Oh , then it 's just gonna be the five of us ?"
"[01:53] mn015 | Well , he he was very affirmative in his way of saying he will be here at four . But you know , that was before he knew about that George lecture probably ."
[01:54] me010 | Yeah .
[02:01] me010 | Right .
[02:05] me010 | It 's not bad for the project if Keith is talking to George .
[02:10] me010 | OK . So my suggestion is we just
[02:20] fe004 | Are you in charge ?
[02:25] mn015 | Um .
"[02:27] mn015 | Well , I sort of had informal talks with"
"[02:30] mn015 | most of you . So , Eva just reported she 's really happy about the CBT 's being in the same order in the XML as in the"
[02:36] fn050 | Yeah .
[02:38] mn015 | um be Java declaration format so you don't have to
[02:40] fn050 | The e
"[02:42] fn050 | Uh , yeah ."
[02:43] mn015 | do too much in the style sheet
"[02:45] fn050 | Yeah , so ."
[02:45] mn015 | transversion .
"[02:46] mn015 | The uh , Java the embedded Bayes wants to take input uh , uh , a Bayes - net in in some Java notation"
[02:54] mn015 | and
[02:55] mn015 | Eva is using the Xalan style sheet processor to convert the XML that 's output by the Java Bayes
"[03:04] mn015 | for the into the , uh , E Bayes input ."
[03:07] me003 | Mmm .
"[03:07] fn050 | Actually , maybe I could try , like , emailing the guy and see if he has any something already ."
[03:12] me010 | Sure .
[03:12] mn015 | Hmm .
"[03:13] fn050 | That 'd be weird , that"
[03:17] fn050 | Yeah .
[03:18] me003 | But that 's some sort of conversion program ?
[03:19] fn050 | Yeah .
[03:21] fn050 | And put them into different formats .
"[03:23] fn050 | Oh Yep , he could do that , too ."
[03:25] me003 | I think you should demand things from him .
"[03:30] me010 | No , I think it 's a good idea that you may as well ask . Sure ."
[03:31] fn050 | Yeah .
"[03:36] mn015 | And , um , well pretty mu pretty much on t on the top of my list , I would have asked Keith how the "" where is X ? "" hand parse is standing ."
[03:47] mn015 | Um . But we 'll skip that .
"[03:55] mn015 | Uh , there 's good news from Johno . The generation templates are done ."
[04:01] me003 | the XML trees for the for the gene for the synthesizer
"[04:05] me003 | are written . So I just need to do the , uh write a new set of tree combining rules . But"
[04:12] me003 | I think those 'll be pretty similar to the old ones .
[04:15] me003 | So .
[04:17] me010 | Oh !
[04:20] me010 | You were gonna send me a note
[04:24] mn015 | Yes .
[04:30] me003 | I know what he 's talking about .
[04:31] me010 | OK .
[04:32] me010 | But Nancy doesn't .
[04:33] fe004 | Hiring somebody .
[04:36] me003 | The guy .
[04:38] me010 | No .
[04:38] mn015 | natural language generation produces
[04:42] mn015 | not a just a surface string that is fed into a text - to - speech
[04:45] fe004 | Yeah .
"[04:46] mn015 | but , a surface string with a syntax tree that 's fed into a concept - to - speech ."
[04:51] mn015 | Now and this concept - to - speech module has certain rules on how if you get the following syntactic
[04:51] fe004 | Better .
"[04:57] mn015 | structure , how to map this onto prosodic rules ."
[04:57] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[05:01] mn015 | And Fey has foolheartedly agreed to rewrite
[05:10] fe004 | I didn't know she spoke German .
"[05:13] mn015 | No , she doesn't . But she speaks English ."
"[05:13] fe004 | Oh , OK ."
"[05:15] fe004 | Oh . Rewrite the German ones into English . OK , got it ."
[05:17] mn015 | Into English . And um
"[05:23] mn015 | if it 's OK that we give her a couple of more hours per week , then she 'll do that ."
"[05:25] fe004 | OK , got it ."
[05:29] me003 | What language is that written i Is that that Scheme thing that you showed me ?
[05:32] mn015 | Yeah .
[05:33] mn015 | That 's the LISP - type scheme .
[05:35] me003 | She knows how to program in Scheme ? I hope ?
[05:39] mn015 | My guess is I I asked for a commented version of that file ?
"[05:44] mn015 | If we get that , then it 's doable , even without getting into it , even though the Scheme li uh , stuff is really well documented in the Festival ."
"[05:52] me003 | Well , I guess if you 're not used to functional programming , Scheme can be completely incomprehensible ."
[05:58] me003 | Like there 's lots of unnamed functions and You know ?
[05:59] me010 | Syntax .
"[06:06] me010 | But anyway , send me the note and then I 'll - I 'll check with , uh , Morgan on the money . I I don't anticipate any problem but we have to ask ."
"[06:17] me010 | You know , on the generation thing ,"
"[06:22] me010 | sh y she 's really going to do that , then we should be able to get prosody as well . So it 'll say it 's nonsense with"
[06:30] me010 | perfect intonation .
[06:33] me003 | Are we gonna Can we change the voice
"[06:36] me003 | of the of the thing , because right now the voice sounds like a murderer ."
[06:39] mn015 | Yep . We ha we have to change the voice .
[06:40] fe004 | Wh - Which one ?
[06:41] me003 | The the little Smarticus Smarticus sounds like a murderer .
[06:44] fe004 | Oh .
"[06:52] mn015 | It is Uh , we have the choice between the , uh , usual Festival voices , which I already told the SmartKom people we aren't gonna use because they 're really bad ."
[07:01] fe004 | Festival ?
"[07:03] fe004 | Oh , oh . Got it . OK ."
"[07:08] mn015 | OGI has , uh , crafted a couple of diphone"
"[07:12] mn015 | type voices that are really nice and we 're going to use that . We can still , um , d agree on a gender , if we want ."
[07:20] mn015 | So we still have male or female .
"[07:22] fe004 | Well , let 's just pick whatever sounds best ."
[07:23] mn015 | Hmm ?
[07:24] fe004 | Whatever sounds best .
"[07:27] fe004 | Unfortunately , probably male voices , a bit more research on . So ."
[07:28] me010 | Orego -
[07:28] me003 | Original German Institute ?
[07:31] me010 | Or -
[07:31] mn015 | Oregon . Try Oregon .
[07:32] me010 | Oregon @ @ Graduate Institute
[07:32] me003 | Oh .
[07:32] fe004 | Oregon Graduate Insti -
[07:33] me003 | Ah .
[07:35] me010 | It turns out there 's the long - standing links with these guys in the speech group .
[07:40] me010 | Very long .
[07:41] me003 | Hmm !
[07:49] me010 | He 's - spends a fair amount of time here . Anyway .
[07:52] me010 | Leave it . Won't be a problem .
"[07:55] mn015 | OK . And it 's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to , um"
"[08:01] mn015 | learn that as of twenty minutes ago , David and I , per accident , uh managed to get"
"[08:08] mn015 | the whole SmartKom system running on the uh , ICSI Linux machines with the ICSI NT machines"
[08:15] mn015 | thereby increasing the number of running SmartKom systems in this house from one on my laptop to three .
"[08:22] fe004 | Mmm , that 's good ."
[08:22] me003 | How was this by accident ?
"[08:23] fe004 | Yeah , I know . Tha - that 's the part I didn't understand ."
"[08:24] mn015 | Um , I suggested to try something that was really kind of even though against better knowledge shouldn't have worked , but it worked ."
[08:33] fe004 | Hmm !
[08:34] mn015 | Intuition . Maybe maybe maybe a bit for the AI i intuition thing .
[08:39] mn015 | OK .
"[08:41] mn015 | And , um , we 'll never found out why ."
[08:43] mn015 | It - it 's just like why why the generation ma the presentation manager is now working ?
[08:48] me045 | Hmm !
[08:49] mn015 | Which
"[08:49] me045 | This is something you ha you get used to as a programmer , right ? You know , and it 's cool , it works out that way ."
[08:57] mn015 | the the people at Saarbruecken and I decided not to touch it ever again .
[09:04] mn015 | OK .
[09:05] mn015 | Um I was gonna ask you where something is
[09:10] me045 | Where OK .
"[09:11] fe004 | Where the "" where is "" construction is ."
[09:11] mn015 | Where is X ?
[09:12] me045 | What what thing is this ?
[09:14] me045 | OK .
"[09:15] mn015 | Oh , but by Uh , we can ask , uh , did you get to read all four hundred words ? Was it OK ? Was it ?"
[09:20] me010 | I did .
[09:22] me003 | I I wa I was looking at it . It doesn't follow logically .
[09:26] me003 | It doesn't The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph .
[09:29] me045 | And so on .
"[09:34] me010 | I i Yeah . Well , it it 's fine ."
[09:39] me010 | Anyway . Um .
"[09:42] me010 | But c the meeting looks like it 's , it 's gonna be good ."
[09:45] mn015 | Yeah .
"[09:47] fe004 | Yeah , I didn't know about it until Robert told me , like ,"
"[09:49] me010 | Yeah , I I ra I ran across it in I don't even know where , you know some just some weird"
[09:49] fe004 | @ @
[09:54] me010 | place .
"[09:55] me010 | And , uh , yeah , I I 'm surprised I didn't know about it"
"[09:59] me010 | since we know all the invited speakers , an"
"[10:01] me010 | Right , or some Anyway ."
[10:02] me045 | Right .
"[10:03] me010 | So But anyway , yeah ."
[10:05] me010 | I so I I did see that .
"[10:06] me010 | Oh wha Yeah . Before we get started on this st so I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler , who said yes indeed she would love to work with us on the , um , you know , using these structured belief - nets and stuff"
"[10:25] me010 | but starting in August , that she 's also got a new student working on this and that we should get in touch with them again in August and then we 'll figure out a way for you uh you to get seriously connected with , um"
"[10:41] me010 | that 's , uh looks"
[10:44] me010 | pretty good .
[10:58] me010 | we 're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard .
[11:05] me010 | We 've been so far working on things that are easy .
[11:20] fe004 | It 's hard .
[11:21] me010 | Huh ?
[11:22] me010 | It 's a hard puzzle . But the other part of it is the way they connect to
"[11:29] me010 | these , uh , probabilistic relational models ."
"[11:32] me010 | So there 's all the problems that the linguists know about , about mental spaces , and the cognitive linguists know about , but then there 's this problem of the"
[11:44] me010 | belief - net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief - nets .
"[11:53] me010 | they incorrectly call dynamic belief - nets . So there 's a term "" dynamic belief - net "" , doesn't mean that . It means time slices . And Srini used those and people use them ."
[11:54] fe004 | Mmm .
[12:04] me010 | Uh .
[12:06] me010 | But
"[12:07] me010 | one of the things I w would like to do over the next , uh , month , it may take more , is to st understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them"
[12:19] me010 | for multiple worlds
[12:21] me010 | and
"[12:23] me010 | uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be , but also what that would translate into in terms of belief - net and the inferences ."
"[12:33] me010 | So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models , they 're set up , in principle , so that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other , and all that sort of stuff , so it should be feasible"
"[12:48] me010 | to set them up in such a way that if you 've got the past tense and the present tense and each of those is a separate uh , belief structure"
[12:56] me010 | that they do their inferences with just the couplings that
[13:01] me010 | are appropriate .
"[13:03] me010 | But that 's g that 's , as far as I can tell , it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems . One is"
[13:08] me010 | the linguistic part of
"[13:11] me010 | what are the couplings and and when you have a certain , uh , construction , that implies certain couplings and other couplings , you know , between let 's say between the past and the present , or any other one of these things"
[13:21] me010 | and then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief - net work
[13:29] me010 | if it 's got
"[13:30] me010 | um , let 's say one in in , you know , different tenses or my beliefs and your beliefs , or any of these other ones of of multiple models . So"
[13:42] me010 | um
"[13:44] me010 | you know , in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we"
[13:49] me010 | start
[13:50] me010 | digging into
[14:00] me010 | Um .
[14:02] me010 | And sometimes it 's actually easier
[14:04] me010 | to solve two hard problems than one because they constrain each other . I mean if you 've got huge ra huge range of possible choices
"[14:24] me045 | various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote "" count as a noun phrase "" , you know , occur as an argument of a higher construction , but a bare singular stem doesn't get to act that way . Um ,"
[14:29] me010 | Right .
"[14:35] me045 | and it would take a really long time to explain it now , but I 'm about to write it up this evening ."
"[14:39] me045 | I solved that at the same time as "" how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase "" to get something like "" I the kicked dog "" . Um ."
[14:52] me010 | That 's great .
[14:54] fe004 | Cool .
"[14:54] me010 | No , I know , I th I I think that is gonna be"
[14:58] me010 | sort of
[14:59] me010 | the key to this wh to th the big project of the summer of of getting the constructions right is that
"[15:08] me010 | people do manage to do this so there probably are some , uh , relatively clean rules , they 're just not context - free trees ."
[15:16] me045 | Right .
"[15:16] me010 | And if we if the formalism is is good , then we should be able to"
"[15:24] me010 | have , you know , sort of moderate scale thing . And that by the way is is , Keith , what I encouraged George to be"
[15:30] me010 | talking with you about . Not the formalism yet
[15:32] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[15:33] me010 | but the phenomena .
[15:35] me045 | Yeah .
"[15:36] me010 | The p And Oh , another thing , um"
"[15:41] me010 | there was this , uh"
[15:43] me010 | thing that Nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning
[15:47] me045 | Hmm !
[15:47] me010 | that
[15:49] me045 | Hmm !
"[15:56] me010 | Anyway , uh , that we were that we 're gonna try to get a"
"[16:00] me010 | uh , first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week ."
[16:07] me010 | OK ? Probably skipping the mental spaces part .
[16:07] me045 | Alright .
[16:09] me045 | Right . I do .
"[16:10] me010 | Uh , just trying to write up essentially what what you guys have worked out"
"[16:16] me010 | so that everybody has something to look at . We 've talked about it , but only the innermost inner group"
"[16:22] me010 | currently , uh , knows , uh"
[16:22] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[16:25] me045 | OK .
"[16:32] me010 | Well that that yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document , right ? , is is that"
[16:35] me045 | Yeah .
[16:36] fe004 | Right .
[16:36] me010 | it actually transfers from head to head .
[16:39] me045 | OK .
"[16:40] fe004 | Ah , communication !"
[16:41] me010 | Huh ?
[16:41] fe004 | Communication .
[16:43] me045 | Hunh !
"[16:48] me010 | Uh l let 's , let 's have that as a goal anyway ."
"[16:54] me010 | No , no , no ."
"[16:55] me010 | No , w uh we 're talking about a week fr e end of next week ."
"[16:58] fe004 | But , uh , but but the two of us will probably talk to you at well before th I mean ."
[16:58] me045 | End of next week . I thought you said beginning of n
[17:01] me045 | Yeah .
"[17:02] fe004 | Anyway , w let 's talk separately about how t"
"[17:06] me010 | OK . Yeah , so so someti sometime next week ."
"[17:09] me045 | Great ,"
[17:09] me010 | Now if it turns out that that effort leads us into
[17:12] me010 | some big hole
[17:14] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[17:14] me010 | that 's fine .
[17:15] me045 | OK .
"[17:15] me010 | You know , if you say we 're we 're dump dump dump ."
"[17:18] me010 | There 's a really hard problem we haven't solved yet that , that 's just fine ."
[17:20] me045 | OK .
[17:22] me045 | But at at least sort of try and work out what the state of the art is right now .
"[17:25] me010 | Right , t t if to the extent that we have it , let 's write it"
[17:29] me045 | OK .
"[17:29] me010 | and to the extent we don't , let 's find out what we need to do ."
[17:31] me045 | OK .
"[17:34] me010 | So , uh"
"[17:48] me010 | I think it is , but uh but I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with"
"[17:53] me010 | "" where is the Powder - Tower ? "" or whatever"
[17:56] me045 | Well .
"[18:06] mn015 | Hmm , yeah . I think I think we already came"
[18:14] mn015 | two alternative ways of representing it . One is sort of a has a
[18:24] me045 | The question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic .
[18:24] fe004 | One of them was th
[18:27] fe004 | Right .
[18:27] mn015 | or comes is resolved
[18:29] fe004 | Right .
[18:31] mn015 | later . Yeah .
[18:32] me045 | I think it has to be the the second case .
[18:34] mn015 | Yeah .
"[18:35] me045 | Um , so d ' you Is it clear what we 're talking about here ?"
[18:35] fe004 | I agree .
[18:39] me045 | The question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path . Um
"[18:39] fe004 | So you might be yeah , y"
[18:43] fe004 | And asking for directions .
"[18:47] me045 | or or whether the construction semantically , uh , is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that 's construed as meaning "" tell me how to get there "" ."
[18:54] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:54] mn015 | So assume these are two , uh , nodes we can observe in the Bayes - net . So these are either"
[18:54] me010 | Yep .
[18:55] fe004 | Yeah .
[18:57] me010 | Right .
[19:00] mn015 | true or false and it 's also just true or false .
"[19:04] mn015 | If we encounter a phrase such as "" where is X ? "" , should that set this to true and this to true , and the Bayes - net figures out which under the c situation in general is more likely ?"
"[19:15] mn015 | Um , or should it just activate"
"[19:19] mn015 | this , have this be false , and the Bayes - net figures out whether this actually now means ?"
"[19:25] me010 | Uh w that 's a s OK , so that 's a that 's a separate issue . So I a I I th I agree with you that , um , it 's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every"
[19:26] fe004 | Slightly different .
[19:28] me045 | OK .
"[19:40] me010 | uh , pragmatic"
"[19:41] me010 | reading , although there are some that will need to be there ."
[19:42] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[19:47] me045 | Right .
[19:48] fe004 | Right .
[19:49] fe004 | Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications of the same one . Right .
[19:53] me010 | You can't do that either . Yeah .
[19:54] fe004 | Yeah .
"[19:54] me010 | But , you know , c um almost certainly "" can you pass the salt "" is a construction worth"
[19:58] me045 | Yeah .
[20:00] me010 | noting that there is this th this this this uh
[20:01] fe004 | Request .
[20:02] me045 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
"[20:04] me045 | So right , this one is maybe in the gray area . Is it is it like that or is it just sort of"
[20:08] me010 | Ri -
[20:08] fe004 | Mmm .
[20:09] me010 | Yeah .
[20:10] me045 | obvious from world knowledge that no one you wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there or whatever .
"[20:16] mn015 | Or in some cases , it 's it 's quite definitely s so that you just know wanna know"
[20:18] me010 | Yeah .
[20:20] me045 | Yeah .
"[20:21] me045 | Well the question is basically , is this conventional or conversational implicature ?"
[20:24] me010 | Exactly . Yeah .
"[20:26] fe004 | Might be , yeah ."
"[20:26] me010 | And I guess , see , the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in ei"
[20:34] me010 | f in the short run it 's more important to know
"[20:39] me010 | technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B , than it is t to decide A or B r"
[20:42] fe004 | Right .
"[20:42] me045 | OK , right ."
[20:43] fe004 | Right .
"[20:44] me045 | Which of that is . Yeah , OK"
[20:45] mn015 | Hmm .
[20:45] me010 | right now .
[20:46] fe004 | Cuz there will be other k examples that are one way or the other . Right .
[20:48] me045 | Yeah .
"[20:52] me010 | In the short run , let 's let 's"
[20:54] me010 | be real clear on h
[20:56] me010 | what the two alternatives would be .
[20:58] me045 | OK .
"[21:09] mn015 | But the nice thing is w we would have a person that would like to work on it , and that 's Ir - Irina Gurevich from EML who is going to be visiting us , uh , the week before , uh , August"
[21:21] mn015 | and a little bit into August .
"[21:31] mn015 | being crafted at EML . That 's not the one I sent you . The one I sent you was from GMD , out of a European CRUMPET ."
[21:37] me010 | It was terrible .
[21:39] mn015 | Agreed .
"[21:40] mn015 | Um , and one of the reas one of the those ideas was ,"
"[21:46] mn015 | so ,"
[21:47] mn015 | back to the old Johno observation that if y if you have a dialogue history and it said
"[21:53] mn015 | the word "" admission fee """
[21:55] mn015 | was
"[21:57] mn015 | uh , mentioned"
"[21:58] mn015 | um , it 's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it"
[22:04] mn015 | from the outside .
"[22:05] mn015 | Now what could imagine to , you know , have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history , yeah ? That 's the really stupid way ."
"[22:15] mn015 | Then there is the really clever way that was suggested by Keith and then there is the , uh , middle way that I 'm suggesting and that is you you get X , which is whatever , the castle ."
"[22:26] mn015 | The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours , that they have admission fees , they have whatever ."
"[22:34] mn015 | And then , this is We go via a thesaurus"
[22:39] mn015 | and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically
[22:48] mn015 | for each e entity . We look it up
[22:50] mn015 | check whether any of these were mentioned
[22:52] mn015 | and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse
[22:57] mn015 | side .
"[23:11] me045 | So if someone mentions admission f fees , that activates an Enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your rep in the representation of what 's being talked about . And then when someone asks "" where is X ? "" you 've already got the the Enter schema activated and you 're able to to conclude on it . Yeah ."
[23:25] me010 | Mm - hmm .
[23:25] fe004 | Kind of a priming
[23:27] fe004 | priming a spreading activation
[23:28] me010 | Right .
[23:29] me010 | Yeah . So that 's certainly more realistic . I m I mean psychologically . Now technically
[23:33] me045 | Right .
[23:37] me045 | Yeah .
"[23:40] me003 | Well , uh , is it doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a a thread , that"
"[23:49] me003 | I mean , cuz it would the the thread would know what nodes like , needed to be activated , so it could just keep track of how long it 's been since something 's been mentioned , and automatically load it in ."
[23:59] me010 | Yeah .
[24:00] me010 | You could do that . Um .
[24:05] me010 | But
"[24:06] me010 | here 's here 's a way in th in the bl Bayes - net you could you could think about it this way , that if"
"[24:14] me010 | um at the time "" admissions fee "" was mentioned you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter ."
"[24:30] me010 | Fair enough , OK , but , but , in terms of the c c the current implementation right ?"
[24:34] me010 | so that
[24:35] me010 | um
[24:37] fe004 | It would already be higher in the context .
[24:44] me010 | This is this is essentially the Bayes - net equivalent
[24:46] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[24:49] me045 | Yeah .
[24:50] me010 | In some ways it 's not as good but it 's the implementation we got . We don't have a connectionist implementation .
"[24:53] me045 | Yeah , sure . No , I mean"
[24:55] me010 | Now my guess is that it 's not a question of time but it
[25:00] me010 | is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned .
"[25:04] fe004 | Yeah , relevance . Yeah ."
"[25:06] me010 | I mean , we could look at dialo this is Of course the other thing we ha we do is , is we have this data coming"
[25:06] me045 | Yeah .
[25:11] me045 | Yeah .
"[25:11] me010 | which probably will blow all our theories , but but skipping that so so but my guess is what what 'll probably will happen ,"
"[25:13] me045 | Yeah , right ."
"[25:20] me010 | is that there 're certain constructions which , uh , for our purposes do"
[25:27] me010 | change the probabilities of EVA decisions and various other kinds
[25:33] me010 | th that
"[25:36] me010 | the , uh , standard way that that the these contexts work is sort of stack - like or whatever , but that 's sort of the most recent thing ."
[25:44] me010 | And so it could be that when another
"[25:48] me010 | uh , en tourist entity gets mentioned , you"
"[25:52] me010 | re re essentially re - initiali you know , re - i essentially re - initialize the state ."
[25:53] me003 | Mmm .
[25:54] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[25:59] me010 | And of course i if we had a fancier one with multiple worlds
"[26:02] me010 | you could have uh , you could keep track of what"
[26:08] me010 | someone was uh
"[26:10] me010 | saying about this and that . You know , "" I wanna go in the morning I wanna """
[26:12] me045 | Yeah .
[26:20] me045 | Yeah .
"[26:20] me010 | Uh , tal so I 'm talking about shopping and then you say , uh , you know , well , um"
"[26:26] me010 | "" What 's it cost ? "" or something . Or Anyway . So one could well imagine , but not yet ."
[26:27] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[26:31] me045 | Yeah .
[26:36] me010 | It 'll turn out that it 's gonna be depend pretty much on whether there 's been an override .
"[26:43] mn015 | Yeah , I mean , if if you ask "" how much does a train ride and and cinema around the vineyards cost ? "" and then somebody tells you it 's sixty dollars and then you say"
"[26:53] mn015 | "" OK"
"[26:55] mn015 | How much is , uh I would like to visit the "" whatever , something completely different , "" then I go to , you know , Point Reyes "" ,"
[27:01] me010 | Yeah .
"[27:03] mn015 | it it 's not more likely that you want to enter anything , but it 's , as a matter of fact , a complete rejection of entering"
[27:09] mn015 | by doing that .
"[27:10] fe004 | So when you admit have admission fee and it changes something , it 's only for that particular It 's relational , right ? It 's only for that particular object ."
"[27:16] me010 | Yeah , I th th Yeah ."
"[27:17] me010 | Well , and and and the simple idea is that it 's on it 's only for m for the current"
[27:21] fe004 | Yeah .
[27:24] fe004 | Right .
[27:34] me010 | It goes the other d it goes in the other direction .
"[27:38] me010 | When th When the this is mentioned , the"
[27:43] me010 | uh
"[27:44] me010 | probability of of , let 's say , entering changes"
[27:48] me010 | changes .
[27:48] fe004 | For But Right .
"[27:53] me003 | It observes an er , it sets the a node for"
[27:54] me010 | Yeah .
[27:56] me010 | Yeah .
"[27:57] me003 | "" entered "" or "" true "" or something , "" discourse enter "" ."
"[27:57] me010 | Now , uh But I think Ro - Robert 's right , that to determine that ,"
"[28:07] me010 | So , if the issue is , if so now th this construction has been matched and you say "" OK ."
"[28:12] me010 | Does this actually have any implications for our decisions ? """
[28:16] me010 | Then there 's another piece of code
"[28:22] fe004 | So , sort of forward chaining in a way , rather than backward . OK ."
[28:24] me010 | Yeah .
"[28:28] me010 | But but what 's Robert 's saying is is ,"
[28:32] me010 | is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself
[28:40] me010 | Uh
[28:42] me010 | maybe .
[28:44] me010 | I 'll have to think about that .
[28:46] fe004 | Hmm .
[28:48] me010 | I don't know .
[28:49] me010 | I mean it th
[28:50] me010 | I can thi I can think of arguments in either direction on that . But somehow you want to do it .
[28:54] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:00] mn015 | Well , it 's just another , sort of , construction side is how to get at the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history"
"[29:13] fe004 | Guess it 's like I g The other thing is , whether you have a m"
[29:16] fe004 | m user model
"[29:17] fe004 | that has , you know , whatever , a current plan ,"
"[29:21] fe004 | whatever ,"
"[29:23] fe004 | plans that had been discussed , and"
"[29:31] me010 | Oh , wel"
"[29:32] me010 | Well , the ar the The argument is that"
"[29:38] me010 | If you 've recognized the word ,"
"[29:42] me010 | you 've recognized the word , which means you have a lexical construction for it , so you could just as well tag"
[29:47] me010 | the lexical construction with the fact that it 's a
"[29:51] me010 | uh , you know , thirty percent increase in"
[29:55] me010 | probability of entering .
"[29:57] me010 | You So you could you could you could invert invert the whole thing , so you s you tag that information on to the lexicon since you"
[29:57] me003 | Mmm .
"[29:58] me003 | Oh , I see ."
[30:06] me010 | had to recognize it anyway .
[30:08] me010 | That that 's the argument in the other direction .
"[30:15] mn015 | construction itself out out of context ,"
"[30:21] mn015 | "" But I but I 'm not interested in the opening times """
"[30:26] me010 | Yeah there 's , yeah ther there 's that as well ."
[30:28] mn015 | Yep .
[30:28] mn015 | Hmm .
[30:29] mn015 | So .
[30:37] mn015 | This is a s
"[30:37] mn015 | just a sidetrack , but uh"
"[30:43] mn015 | um , sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of , uh , inferences , on"
"[30:54] mn015 | uh , has crept up in the dialogue history already , or not ."
"[30:59] mn015 | And , um"
"[31:02] mn015 | If we wanted to have that function in the dialogue hi dialogue module of SmartKom , I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there ."
[31:09] me010 | Good .
"[31:11] me010 | Well , this this is highly relevant to someone 's thesis ."
"[31:15] mn015 | Yes , um ."
[31:17] me010 | You 've noticed that .
"[31:17] mn015 | That 's uh , I 'm I 'm"
[31:19] mn015 | keeping on good terms with Jan . Yeah .
"[31:21] me010 | So the point is , it 's very likely that Robert 's thesis is going to be along these lines , and the local rules are"
"[31:26] fe004 | Oh , s"
"[31:29] me010 | if it 's your thesis , you get to decide how it 's done ."
"[31:33] me010 | OK . So if , you know if this is seriously , if this becomes part of your thesis , you can say , hey we 're gonna do it this way , that 's the way it 's done ."
[31:35] mn015 | Mmm .
"[31:40] fe004 | Yay , it 's not me . It 's always me when it 's someone 's thesis ."
"[31:45] me010 | No , no , no ! No , no . We 've got a lot we 've got a lot of theses going ."
[31:48] me010 | Yeah .
"[31:51] mn015 | Well , let 's let 's talk after Friday the twenty - ninth ."
[31:55] me010 | Right . So h he 's got a th he 's got a meet meeting in Germany with his thesis advisor .
"[31:58] fe004 | Yeah , he said he 's gonna f finish his thesis by then ."
[32:00] me045 | Oh yeah .
[32:02] mn015 | I should try to finish it by then . Yeah . So .
"[32:04] me010 | Oh , right ."
"[32:29] me010 | Yeah . So I think in fact ,"
"[32:32] me010 | That 's the other thing . uh , this is this is ,"
"[32:34] me010 | speaking of hard problems , this is a very good time"
"[32:38] me010 | um , to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and you know , where c where the construction"
[32:46] me010 | per - se
"[32:48] me010 | ends and where construal comes in , cuz this is clearly part of th Huh ?"
[32:49] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[32:49] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
"[32:50] fe004 | Yeah , we 've we 've done quite a bit of that . We 've been doing quite a bit of that ."
[32:53] me045 | Yeah .
[32:53] me010 | Well I said . But that 's part of what the f
"[32:54] fe004 | We have many jobs for you , Ro - Robert . The conclusion ."
[32:55] me010 | Yeah .
"[32:56] me010 | Well , he 's gonna need this ."
[32:58] fe004 | Yeah .
"[32:58] me010 | Right . So . Right . So thing That 's part of why we want the formalism , is is because th it is gonna have implicit in it"
[33:02] me045 | Yeah .
[33:05] mn015 | Was I ? In the room ?
[33:10] fe004 | Obviously .
[33:11] fe004 | Yeah .
"[33:11] me010 | Right . Well I That 's tentative . They aren't decisions , they 're ju they 're just proposals ."
"[33:13] me045 | Yeah . Right , right , right ."
"[33:15] fe004 | No , they 're decisions . OK ."
"[33:17] me010 | Yeah , that That 's the point , is is th"
[33:18] me045 | Yeah .
[33:20] me010 | Yeah .
[33:21] me010 | Yeah . Anyway . But so that 's that 's w
"[33:21] fe004 | Actually , yeah . There 's a problem with that word , too , though ."
"[33:23] me003 | Yeah , but it he the decisions I made wer had to do with my thesis . So consequently don't I get to decide then that it 's Robert 's job ?"
[33:23] me010 | Yeah .
[33:32] me010 | Uh .
"[33:38] mn015 | I 've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions , so we 'll we 'll find a way ."
"[33:43] me010 | Well , we we we will , but um"
[33:47] mn015 | It it might even be interesting then to say that I should be forced to
"[33:55] mn015 | um , sort of pull some of the ideas that have been floating in my head out of the , uh out of the top hat"
[34:02] me010 | Yes .
[34:06] me010 | So -
"[34:08] me010 | Ri - No . Absolutely . So , uh , wh you had you know you ha You had done one draft ."
[34:15] me010 | And a another draft
[34:19] me010 | OK .
[34:20] me010 | D i @ @
[34:20] me010 | I i
"[34:26] me010 | Right . Anyway , uh . So . But , yeah , a second that would be great . So , uh , a sec I mean you 're gonna need it anyway ."
[34:31] mn015 | Hmm .
[34:34] me010 | and
[34:36] me010 | Right .
[34:39] me010 | Yep .
[34:40] fe004 | Bomb proof !
[34:41] me045 | Good .
[34:41] mn015 | Bullet - proof .
[34:43] me010 | Both proof .
[34:44] me045 | Either way .
[34:44] fe004 | Both .
[34:46] me010 | Uh
"[34:47] me010 | So that , so th thi this I mean , so this is the point , is we we 're going to have to cycle through this , but"
[34:51] me045 | Yeah .
[34:52] me010 | th the draft of the p proposal on the constructions is is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by construal .
"[35:04] me010 | And , um , we oughta be doing it ."
"[35:06] mn015 | Yeah , we need we need some Then we need to make some dates ."
[35:20] mn015 | I just talked to Ami . It 's - it 's a coincidence that he can't do couldn't do it today here .
"[35:25] fe004 | Usually , he can ."
"[35:32] mn015 | Yeah , it was just an exception ."
[35:36] me045 | It 's i Is it staying basically at the Wednesday noon ?
"[35:39] me010 | Yeah , it was th"
"[35:40] me045 | OK . It was th off this week , yeah ."
[35:40] fe004 | Yeah . I always thought it was staying .
[35:42] me010 | Right .
"[35:42] fe004 | Yeah , I thought it was just this week that we were changing it ."
[35:42] mn015 | Mmm . Yeah .
[35:43] me010 | OK .
"[35:45] mn015 | And , um . How do we feel about doing it Wednesdays ? Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we have things to discuss with other people , there they seem to be s tons of people around ."
[35:58] me010 | The only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other
[36:03] mn015 | subgroup meetings
"[36:04] me010 | s you know , other other No , you Uh , people in this group connecting with with"
"[36:09] me010 | those people who who might not be around so much . Uh , I don't care . I I uh"
[36:15] me010 | you know
[36:22] me010 | OK .
"[36:27] me045 | Yeah , I can understand that ."
[36:29] me010 | people people differ in their tastes in this matter . I I 'm neutral .
[36:30] me045 | Yeah .
[36:32] me045 | Yeah .
[36:35] me010 | Yeah . @ @ That 's Me too . I 'm basically I 'm here . So .
[36:36] fe004 | It doesn't matter .
"[36:38] mn015 | Well , if one sort of thing is , this room is taken at after three - thirty pr pretty much every day"
"[36:45] mn015 | by the data collection . So we have subjects anyway Except for this week , we have subjects in here . That 's why it was one ."
[36:46] fe004 | Oh .
[36:50] me010 | OK .
[36:51] mn015 | So we just knew i
[36:52] fe004 | So did you just say that Ami can't make one o ' clock ?
"[36:54] mn015 | No , he can ."
"[36:54] fe004 | Oh , OK ."
[36:55] me045 | Oh .
"[36:55] mn015 | So let 's say Thursday one . But for next week , this is a bit"
[36:59] mn015 | late .
[37:05] mn015 | OK . About the c the th
[37:08] fe004 | that be horrible ?
[37:10] mn015 | Yes .
[37:10] fe004 | Oh really ?
"[37:11] mn015 | Because , uh , this room is again taken at two - thirty by Morgan ."
"[37:13] fe004 | Oh , OK . OK . You didn't tell me that . OK , that 's fine ."
[37:17] mn015 | And
"[37:19] fe004 | OK , OK , OK ."
[37:21] fe004 | OK . Yeah .
[37:24] me010 | Interesting . So you 're proposing that we meet Tuesday .
[37:28] mn015 | How about that ?
[37:29] me010 | I I could
[37:29] me045 | Next week .
"[37:29] fe004 | Well , we 're meeting Tuesday . I mean we usually meet Tuesday or l like , linguists um , at two ."
[37:33] me045 | That 's right .
[37:35] fe004 | So .
[37:36] me003 | And the s
[37:37] fe004 | Do you want to meet again here bef
[37:38] me003 | Is the Speech - Gen meeting still at on Tuesdays ?
"[37:40] mn015 | Well , actually we w we we did scrap our Monday time just because Bhaskara couldn't"
[37:42] fe004 | Hhh . Maybe I do need a Palm Pilot .
[37:45] mn015 | come Monday . So there 's Nothing 's impeding Monday anymore either .
"[37:50] me003 | Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday er , take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping ."
"[37:57] mn015 | But , um . I mean , there are also usually then holidays anyways ."
[38:02] mn015 | Sometimes it works out that way .
[38:06] mn015 | So . Hmm !
[38:20] me045 | Yeah . There 's just sort of the
[38:23] fe004 | The multiple meetings yeah .
[38:23] me045 | two to four of us . Right ? Yeah . So .
[38:26] fe004 | Right .
"[38:33] mn015 | OK , so l forget about the b the camping thing . So let 's eh , any other problems w w w ?"
[38:45] mn015 | So .
"[38:45] me045 | Um , all of the proposed times sound fine with me ."
[38:48] fe004 | Same here .
[38:48] mn015 | Monday ?
[38:51] me010 | What I think Robert 's saying is that
[38:53] me045 | Earlier in the week
"[38:54] me010 | earlier we At least for next week , there 's a lot of stuff we want to get done , so why don't we plan to meet Monday and we 'll see if we want to meet any more than that ."
[38:55] me045 | Mm - hmm . Yeah .
[38:56] mn015 | Mmm .
[39:00] me045 | OK .
[39:01] mn015 | OK .
"[39:04] mn015 | One , two , three ?"
[39:05] mn015 | Three 's too late . Two - thirty ?
"[39:07] me010 | Oh , I i Yeah , I actually Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday ."
"[39:10] mn015 | OK , two ."
[39:14] me010 | Here I 'm blissfully agreeing to things and realizing that I actually do have some stuff scheduled on Monday .
[39:18] me045 | Sure . Sounds great .
"[39:21] me045 | Uh , so that 's the eighteenth ."
[39:24] me003 | No way !
[39:26] fe004 | Y you 'll come and take all the the headph the good headphones first and then remind me .
[39:26] mn015 | W why do you ?
"[39:29] me045 | Yeah , exactly ."
[39:31] mn015 | And
"[39:31] me045 | Sorry , two PM ."
[39:32] fe004 | Why do I have this unless I 'm gonna write ? Fine .
"[39:33] mn015 | do I get to see th uh , your formalism before that ?"
[39:38] fe004 | Uh . Would you like to ?
[39:40] mn015 | Mm - hmm .
[39:46] fe004 | Yeah .
"[39:47] me010 | Well m @ @ you know , w maybe Mond - Maybe we can put This is part of what we can do Monday , if we want ."
[39:47] fe004 | Yeah . I
[39:51] fe004 | OK .
[39:51] mn015 | OK .
[39:52] me010 | Is some some version
"[39:53] fe004 | Yeah , so there was like , you know , m m in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version , like , everything I know ."
[39:59] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[40:01] me045 | Yeah .
[40:02] me045 | OK .
[40:03] me045 | Why don't w Maybe you and I should meet sort of more or less first thing Monday morning and then we can work on this .
[40:05] fe004 | Yes .
[40:06] fe004 | Yeah .
[40:07] fe004 | That 's f fine with me . So .
[40:08] me045 | OK .
"[40:10] fe004 | I might I might um , s You said you 're busy over th until the weekend , right ?"
"[40:13] me045 | Yeah , sort of through the weekend because Kate has a photography show ."
[40:15] fe004 | That 's fine . So we might continue our email
[40:18] me045 | Yeah .
"[40:20] me045 | Um , if you have time after this I 'll show you the noun phrase thing ."
[40:22] fe004 | OK . That would be cool . So .
"[40:24] fe004 | OK , and"
[40:27] fe004 | You wanna m
"[40:28] mn015 | we 'll see an intermediate version of the formalism for the constructions , and do an on - line merging with my construal ideas ."
[40:32] me045 | Yeah .
"[40:38] fe004 | Sure , sure ."
[40:38] me010 | OK .
[40:39] me045 | Alright .
"[40:40] mn015 | So it won't be , like , a for semi - formal presentation of my proposal . It 'll be more like towards finalizing that proposal . OK , that 's fine ."
[40:41] fe004 | That 's OK .
[40:47] me045 | OK .
[40:50] me045 | Yeah .
[40:52] mn015 | Yikes .
"[40:53] me045 | Oy , deadlines ."
[40:57] mn015 | Perfect . Can you also write it up ?
"[41:07] mn015 | OK . And , um ."
"[41:13] me045 | Someday we also have to we should probably talk about the other side of the "" where is X "" construction , which is the issue of , um , how do you simulate questions ? What does the simspec look like for a question ?"
[41:21] mn015 | Yeah .
[41:24] me045 | Because it 's a little different . We had to we had an idea for this which seemed like it would probably work .
[41:24] fe004 | Yeah .
"[41:25] me010 | Yeah , now , we we w"
[41:27] me010 | Great . OK . Yeah . Simspec may need we may n need to re - name that .
[41:32] me045 | Yeah .
[41:40] me045 | Mmm .
[41:44] me045 | It 's more general @ @
"[41:46] me010 | You know , so it 's a m minimal change ."
[41:51] me010 | Right .
[41:53] me045 | Cool .
"[41:53] me010 | Right , a little substi substi You know , that 's what text substitution"
[41:56] me045 | Yeah . It 's good for you .
[41:56] fe004 | Yeah .
"[41:56] me010 | uh macros are for . Anyway , uh , so let 's let 's for the moment call it that until we think of something better ."
[42:01] me045 | OK .
"[42:05] me010 | Part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there , incl including the questions We didn't we never did figure out how we were gonna do emphasis"
[42:11] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[42:14] me045 | Yeah .
[42:14] me010 | in in
"[42:16] me010 | uh , the semspec ."
[42:27] me045 | Yeah .
[42:28] me010 | But that 's part of the formalism is got to be
"[42:31] me010 | uh , how things like that get marked ."
[42:34] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[42:37] fe004 | You have preliminary data ? Cuz I know , you know , we 've been using this one easy sentence"
"[42:42] fe004 | and I 'm sure you guys have uh , maybe you are the one who 've been looking at the rest of it it 'd it 'd be useful for me , if we want to have it a little bit more"
"[42:45] me045 | Um , I"
"[42:48] me045 | To tell you the truth , what I 've been looking at has not been the data so far , I just sort of said "" alright let 's see if I can get noun phrases and , uh , major verb co uh , constructions out of the way first . """
[42:49] fe004 | data oriented .
[42:53] fe004 | Yeah .
[42:56] fe004 | Mm - hmm mm - hmm .
"[42:58] me045 | And I have not gotten them out of the way yet . Surprise . So , um ."
"[43:02] me045 | So , I have not really approached a lot of the data , but I mean obviously like these the the question one , since we have this idea about the indefinite pronoun thing and all that , you know , I ca can try and , um"
"[43:13] me045 | run with that , you know , try and do some of the sentence constructions now . It would make sense ."
[43:16] mn015 | OK . Do you wanna run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry ?
[43:17] fe004 | OK .
"[43:20] me045 | Oh yeah , the basic idea is that um ,"
"[43:23] me045 | uh you know Uh , let 's see if I can formulate this ."
[43:25] mn015 | So Mary fixed the car with a wrench .
[43:27] me045 | Yeah .
"[43:28] mn015 | So you perform the mental sum and then , you know , "" who fixed the car with a wrench ? """
"[43:33] mn015 | You basically are told , to to do this"
"[43:47] mn015 | means , and then come up with that so who that someone was ."
"[43:50] me045 | The WH question has this as sort of extra thing which says "" and when you 're done , tell me who fills that slot "" or w you know . So , um ."
[43:55] me010 | Mm - hmm .
"[43:57] me045 | And , you know , this is sort of a nice way to do it , the idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever you treat , uh , WH constructions similarly to"
"[44:06] me045 | uh , indefinite pronouns like "" someone fixed the car "" because lots of languages , um , have WH questions with an indefinite pronoun in situ or whatever , and you just get intonation to tell you that it 's a question ."
"[44:18] me010 | Alright , which is"
[44:22] me045 | Hmm ?
"[44:22] me010 | In in logic , it 's it 's @ @ it 's actual Huh ? What ?"
[44:23] fe004 | Mmm .
"[44:23] fe004 | Right . Let 's put a Skolem Skolem constant in , yeah ."
[44:24] me045 | Yeah .
[44:28] me045 | Sure .
[44:29] fe004 | Yeah . Right .
[44:29] me045 | OK .
[44:31] me045 | Right .
[44:32] me045 | Right . No . Of course .
[44:32] fe004 | Mmm .
[44:36] me045 | That 's right .
[44:37] mn015 | come up with this
"[44:37] me045 | It makes sense from that point of view , too , which is actually better . So yeah , um ."
"[44:41] me045 | Anyway , but just that kind of thing and we 'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on , but"
[44:45] me010 | Good .
"[44:52] me045 | Uh , no , all the focus stuff . We sort of just dropped that cuz it was too weird and we didn't even know , like , what we were talking about exactly , what the object of study was . So ."
"[44:59] me010 | Yeah . Well , if if I mean , i part of of what the exercise is , t by the end of next week , is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet ."
[45:06] me045 | Yeah .
[45:08] me010 | That 's fine . I mean
[45:08] me045 | Yep .
[45:09] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[45:09] mn015 | Well , if you if you"
[45:11] mn015 | do wanna discuss focus background
[45:15] mn015 | and then
"[45:17] mn015 | get me into that because I mean , I wo I w scientifically worked on that for for almost two years ."
[45:21] me045 | Yeah .
"[45:22] me045 | OK , then certainly we will . Good ."
"[45:24] fe004 | Yeah , you should definitely , um"
"[45:30] me045 | Yeah . w We should figure out what our questions are , for example , to ask you . So ."
[45:32] fe004 | Yeah .
[45:33] fe004 | Yeah .
[45:36] me045 | OK .
[45:43] me010 | Wel - then t Hans .
[45:45] me010 | Has I haven't seen Hans Boas ?
[45:47] fe004 | He 's been around .
[45:48] me045 | Yeah .
"[45:49] me010 | OK . So has he been been involved with this , or ?"
[45:49] fe004 | Just maybe not today .
"[45:51] fe004 | Eh . with us ? Yeah . I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , um , Keith and Keith and me , but um"
[45:52] me045 | Yeah .
[45:52] me010 | Yeah .
"[46:00] fe004 | like in th the meeting I mean , he sort of I thin like the last meeting we had , I think we were all very much part of it but um"
[46:04] me045 | Yeah .
"[46:06] me045 | Sometimes Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil 's advocate type role or something , like "" This make you know , I 'm going to pretend I 'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this . This makes no sense . "" And he 'll just go off on parts of it which definitely need fixing but aren't where we 're at right now , so it 's"
[46:09] fe004 | but different perspec Yeah .
[46:16] fe004 | Right .
"[46:20] fe004 | Like like what you call certain things , which we decided long ago we don't care that much right now ."
[46:22] me045 | Yeah .
[46:23] me010 | Right .
[46:24] me010 | OK .
"[46:24] fe004 | But in a sense , it 's good to know that he of all people you know , like maybe a lot of people would have m much stronger reactions , so , you know , he 's like a relatively friendly linguist and yet a word like "" constraint "" causes a lot of problems ."
[46:30] me045 | Yeah .
[46:33] me045 | Yeah .
"[46:36] fe004 | And , so . Right . So ."
[46:41] me010 | um
"[46:43] me010 | the role I had suggested that he he play ,"
[46:47] fe004 | Ah .
[46:48] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:48] me010 | OK , which was that"
[46:52] me010 | o one of the things I would like to see happen
"[46:55] me010 | is a paper that was tentatively called "" Towards a formal cognitive semantics """
[47:01] me010 | which was addressed to
[47:04] me010 | these linguists uh who haven't been following this stuff at all .
[47:10] me045 | Yeah .
[47:13] me045 | Yeah .
[47:18] me045 | Yeah .
"[47:19] me010 | So , internally , we should just do whatever works , cuz it 's hard enough ."
[47:21] me045 | Yeah .
[47:23] me045 | Yeah .
[47:24] me010 | But if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that
[47:29] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[47:29] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[47:30] me010 | does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world
[47:36] me045 | Yeah .
[47:40] me010 | then it becomes important to use
[47:45] me010 | terminology that
[47:46] me045 | Yeah .
[47:46] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Sure .
[47:46] me010 | doesn't
"[47:48] me010 | make it hard I mean , it 's gonna be plenty hard for for people to understand it as it is , but y y you don't want to make it worse ."
[47:53] me045 | Yeah .
[47:55] me045 | Yeah .
[48:01] me010 | Right .
"[48:03] me010 | Yeah , yeah . No , that 's fine . I just wanted t to"
"[48:06] me010 | I have to catch up with him , and I wanted t to get a feeling for that . OK ."
[48:08] me045 | Yeah .
[48:08] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:10] me045 | So I don't know what his take will be on these meetings exactly , you know ."
[48:13] me010 | OK .
[48:15] me010 | Good .
[48:15] me045 | Cuz sometimes he sort of sounds like we 're talking a bunch of goobledy - gook from his point of view .
"[48:18] fe004 | when we 're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in in English or in German , in particular , whatever ,"
[48:21] me010 | Yeah .
[48:24] me045 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:25] fe004 | that 's great , and Ben and and Hans are , if if anything , more you know , they have more to say than , let 's say , I would about some of these things ."
[48:31] me010 | Right .
[48:37] me045 | Mm - hmm .
[48:39] fe004 | s Which is fine .
[48:40] me045 | Yeah .
[48:41] me010 | the core group and um
[48:42] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
"[48:45] me010 | that 's , you know , I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done ."
[48:50] fe004 | Yes .
[48:53] me045 | Yeah .
[48:54] me010 | I I I I definitely get that impression . Yeah . That 's great .
[48:56] me045 | Yep .
[48:57] fe004 | Yeah .
[48:58] fe004 | So anyone else would like uh ruin the balance of Anyway .
"[49:02] me010 | Well , but Well . But th th then w then we have to come back to the bigger group ."
[49:06] fe004 | Right .
[49:06] me045 | Yeah .
[49:07] me010 | Yeah . Great . And then we 're gon we 're gonna because of this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff ?
[49:15] me010 | So that I guess the three of us are gonna connect tomorrow about that .
"[49:16] fe004 | Yeah , we could talk tomorrow ."
"[49:21] fe004 | came the suggestion that "" oh ,"
"[49:23] fe004 | could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection ? "" which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about . In which case we w we can just say that they 're the effects or the bindings ."
[49:30] me010 | Right .
"[49:34] fe004 | Which uh , so far , in terms of like putting up all the constraints as , you know , pushing them into type constraints , the when I 've , you know , propo then proposed it to linguists who haven't yet given me you know , we haven't yet thought of a reason that that wouldn't work ."
[49:47] fe004 | Right ? As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably complex .
"[49:51] fe004 | So Anyway , to be to talk about later ."
"[49:52] me010 | Yeah , it has to in the sense that"
"[49:57] me010 | you 're gonna use them eventu it 's you know , it 's sort of a , um , generate and test"
[50:02] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[50:02] me010 | kind of thing , and if you over - generate then you 'll have to do more . I mean , if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use"
"[50:10] me010 | uh , in your initial matching"
[50:12] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
"[50:13] me010 | then you 'll match some things I mean , I I d I don't think there 's any way that it could completely fail . It it could be that"
[50:23] me010 | The original bad idea of purely context - free grammars
[50:27] me010 | died because there were just vastly too many parses .
[50:36] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[50:38] fe004 | Mm - hmm .
[50:41] me010 | it would still genera
"[50:41] fe004 | Right ? So by just having semantic even bringing semantics in for matching just in the form of j semantic types , right ? Like"
"[50:48] fe004 | "" conceptually these have to be construed as this , this , and this """
[50:51] me010 | Yeah .
"[50:53] me010 | We don't know , but , yeah ."
"[50:54] fe004 | that , you know And and"
"[50:55] fe004 | it certainly helps a lot . I mean , le let 's put it that way . So ."
[50:57] me010 | No question . Yeah . And I think it 's a it 's a perfectly fine place to start .
"[51:01] me010 | You know , and say , let let 's see how far we can go this way ."
[51:03] fe004 | Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .
[51:07] me003 | Well it definitely makes the problem easier .
[51:09] me010 | I 'm I 'm in favor of that .
"[51:12] me010 | Uh , cuz I think i I think it 's As you know , I think it 's real hard and if w if we Right ."
"[51:25] fe004 | So Friday , Monday"
[51:28] me045 | Yeah .
"[51:28] fe004 | Monday . So . OK , that 's Tuesday . Like th that 's the conclusion . OK ."
[51:29] me045 | Yeah .
[51:31] me010 | Yeah .
"[51:34] mn015 | So , you your dance card is completely filled now ?"
"[51:38] fe004 | Yeah , and I have nothing to do this weekend but work ."
[51:42] me003 | What about What about DDR ?
[51:43] fe004 | It 's almost true .
[51:46] me003 | Mmm .
"[51:49] me010 | DDR , he asked ?"
[51:58] me045 | It 's a It 's It 's a video game ? You stand there and
[52:00] me045 | @ @
"[52:00] me010 | Oh that 's Oh , oh , oh !"
"[52:03] me010 | Yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[52:09] me010 | Oh , right !"
[52:15] me010 | I do . @ @
"[52:17] me010 | No , it 's not one of my hobbies ."
[52:18] me010 | Although I God knows I I I could use something like that . @ @
"[52:21] fe004 | It 's great exercise , I must say ."
"[52:22] me010 | But , uh"
[52:28] me010 | I see I see it things about it on TV . OK ?
[52:32] fe004 | Uh - huh .
"[52:32] me010 | ap Apparently Oh , it 's the hottest thing in Tokyo ?"
[52:35] me045 | That 's the sort of thing that would be hot in Tokyo .
"[52:40] me010 | Yeah , I didn't know it by its initials ."
"[52:41] fe004 | Yeah , yeah , I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend , who 's like "" Oh , well , I can bring over the DDR if you want . """
"[52:47] fe004 | Oh , oh , Dance Dance Revolution OK . He actually brought a clone called Stepping Selection , but it 's just as good . So . Anyw -"

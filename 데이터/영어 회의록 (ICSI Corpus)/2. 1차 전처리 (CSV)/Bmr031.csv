[00:01] me011 | OK . We 're on .
[00:04] fe016 | Right . It would have to be hand Right .
[00:06] me001 | Yeah .
"[00:08] fe016 | Well , a h a person would would check it over and then"
[00:08] fe008 | Hello ? OK .
[00:12] fe008 | Should we close the door ?
"[00:14] me011 | Oh , we 'll wait for Chuck . Close the door behind him ."
"[00:17] fe016 | Well , it 's more"
"[00:20] me013 | I mean , uh u"
"[00:21] me011 | Y you can keep talking , but you should be aware ."
"[00:24] fe016 | You were saying that we were waiting for Chuck , so I just OK ."
"[00:26] me011 | Well , and then , uh then Morgan said "" why don't we start ? "" and I said "" O K "" ."
[00:29] me013 | So the compromise is we 're we 're starting but we 're leaving the door open . So we 'll have a little more background noise and Uh .
[00:33] fe016 | OK .
"[00:43] fe008 | th there 're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this , in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says"
"[00:50] fe016 | Well , that 's good ."
[00:59] me011 | And Chuck gets stuck with the ear - plug mike .
[01:03] fe008 | u
"[01:16] me013 | on the technology , particularly recognition , versus , uh , the recordings and transcriptions and so on ."
"[01:22] me013 | Um , but , um , I was asking , if we could , to uh , kind of make it"
"[01:27] me013 | just whatever is happening rather than one or the other because , uh , next weekend next week I 'll be at a meeting on campus and after that I 'll be Europe for ,"
[01:29] mn017 | Sure .
"[01:35] me013 | uh , several meetings ' worth . Uh , you folks 'll be gone for a couple of the meetings ' worth in in Europe also , right ?"
[01:40] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[01:42] me013 | Really ? OK . Yeah .
"[01:50] me011 | Well , because no one no one ever rep responded with any items . So I have a couple of minor ones . Uh ,"
"[02:02] me011 | some plans . So wha what 's up with IBM , Chuck ? Do you know ?"
"[02:06] me018 | Um ,"
"[02:07] me018 | I think Brian is on vacation now but , uh , before he left we gave him ,"
[02:14] me001 | How many ?
"[02:15] me018 | Uh , what is it ? Four ?"
[02:16] mn014 | Four .
[02:17] me001 | Oh .
[02:17] me018 | Four .
[02:18] me011 | Can you ?
[02:19] me011 | You 're b you 're B ?
[02:19] me018 | Test .
[02:20] me018 | What am I ?
[02:23] me011 | There 's no on .
[02:24] me018 | Test .
[02:27] me011 | Oh . It 's just I 'll Let me raise the gain on that a little bit
[02:27] fe008 | Channel B .
[02:28] me018 | OK .
[02:30] me011 | since it 's so far from your mouth .
[02:35] me011 | Sorry .
"[02:40] me018 | So we gave them four meetings before he left and , um ,"
"[02:44] me018 | that 's it . So , um , I don't think we 'll hear from him before he gets back ."
[02:45] me011 | OK .
[02:52] me018 | I don't know .
[02:52] me013 | What pie chart ?
"[02:54] fe008 | He has a nice pie chart on the , uh , s the current status page ,"
[02:58] fe008 | which shows the amount of transc amount of data that had been transcribed and the amount out of the entire and
[03:01] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[03:05] fe008 | at this point it 's not quite half .
"[03:07] fe008 | Wouldn't Is that what you 'd say , with the pie chart ?"
[03:09] me018 | Yeah .
[03:14] me013 | Half the data that 's been recorded has been transcribed ?
"[03:16] fe008 | Roughly . Almost . Not quite . And I haven't actually caught up with , uh since I got back so recently from my vacation ."
[03:17] me013 | Wow ! That 's getting pretty good .
"[03:22] fe008 | Um , I know that the transcribers finished , um , uh , several meetings while I was gone ."
[03:29] me018 | Right .
[03:31] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[03:33] me018 | Mm - hmm .
[03:35] fe008 | not quite fifty percent but really getting close .
[03:38] fe008 | I think it will be .
"[03:39] mn017 | You mean , pi will be close to one half ?"
[03:50] me011 | Yep .
[03:51] mn017 | Right .
"[03:52] fe008 | But it 's a nice it 's I recommend his his his graphic , cuz it 's it 's a really nice graphic ."
[03:54] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[03:55] mn017 | How do you transcribe that ?
[03:56] me011 | How much do we need transcribed before it 's worth doing some trainings ?
[04:02] fe016 | Mmm .
"[04:03] me011 | I mean , it seems like probably we have enough now . Right ? Because , like like Macrophone wasn't that much data . Right ? And it helped ."
"[04:10] mn017 | Well , we already use it for digit training ."
[04:11] fe016 | But but that was read speech .
[04:13] me011 | You only used that for digits ? Right .
"[04:15] mn017 | Well , we did do some training on digits uh , rather adaptation on digits digits . I mean , supervised adaptation . So ."
[04:17] me011 | That 's right .
[04:21] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[04:26] fe016 | Maybe not counting the non - native
"[04:28] fe016 | speech , cuz if That that just doesn't translate very well ."
"[04:36] mn017 | you know , with adaptation you can use fairly small amount of data to improve your performance . Um ,"
[04:39] me011 | Right .
[04:44] mn017 | and
[04:49] mn017 | uh
[04:54] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[04:55] mn017 | um , but if there 's some someone has some free time , I 'm I 'll be happy to show them"
[05:00] mn017 | how it works and you can play with it .
[05:03] me011 | Cool .
"[05:05] me013 | Uh , I thought you you were already using adaptation"
[05:08] me013 | w on the test set .
[05:08] me011 | Supervised .
[05:13] me013 | I see .
[05:13] mn017 | But you could build a test set which you sort of take your models and ada
"[05:15] me013 | Oh , OK ."
[05:20] me013 | Right .
[05:23] me013 | Right .
"[05:25] me013 | Yeah , yeah . Yeah , whatever this is ."
"[05:31] me011 | I mean , it it 's really weird . Right ? Because it 's it would be hard to get speaker disjoint sets ."
[05:36] me011 | Do y do we just give up on that ?
[05:36] fe016 | Right . And actually the I was thinking about this the original application doesn't really appl
"[05:42] fe016 | I mean , if you 're using this over and over again , you 're gonna be testing on the same the same speakers ."
"[05:48] me011 | Well , but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question ."
[05:53] fe016 | I just mean that it 's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't that
"[05:58] fe016 | you don't have disjoint sets ,"
[05:59] me011 | Right .
[06:00] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:02] me011 | So .
[06:03] fe016 | for this particular kind of application .
[06:07] me011 | Yeah .
"[06:08] me013 | I mean , you could have some"
"[06:10] me013 | parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't , and see what the difference is , you know ,"
[06:14] fe016 | Yeah .
[06:14] me013 | on the others . Yeah .
[06:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[06:19] mn017 | over and over . I mean ,"
[06:22] me011 | Right .
[06:24] mn017 | m m m m
"[06:25] mn017 | Yeah . As long as you 're aware that you 're doing that , that 's I don't see that as a problem ."
[06:28] me013 | You can separate it out and see how if they 're Yeah .
"[06:28] me011 | And then s s similarly with subject matter . That , you know , if you 're training your language model on"
[06:40] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[06:44] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:45] me011 | Are the same .
"[06:46] fe016 | Yeah . They 're actually these , like , function words and "" Yeah ! "" and s stuff like that . And there there 's a lot of speaker dependence there ."
[06:47] me011 | Sure .
[06:49] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:50] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[06:53] fe016 | Even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their
[06:53] me013 | Yeah .
[06:56] me011 | Just from word choice ? Yeah .
"[06:57] fe016 | backchannels and Right . So y So , I don't think you 're"
"[07:02] fe016 | talking the way you write , in in other words ."
"[07:04] me011 | Most certainly . So it 's just , uh ,"
[07:07] me011 | if we 're gonna do that we should give some thought to how we wanna divide it up .
"[07:11] me013 | Yeah . Yeah , so , you know , maybe someone else would do a lot of the work where probably your advice"
[07:17] me011 | Yeah . And similarly with digits . We now have a lot of digits but most of them aren't transcribed .
[07:17] me013 | would be helpful .
"[07:30] me011 | And so , same issue . You know we just need to get"
[07:31] me013 | We want that for sure . Yeah .
[07:33] me011 | someone who 's interested in that to start looking at it .
[07:38] me011 | So who 's working on digits currently ?
"[07:41] me011 | OK , maybe I 'll talk to him and see if he 's interested ."
[07:48] mn017 | Hmm .
"[07:51] me013 | one thing , uh , uh , just a e uh , uh , an announcement of sorts is that , um ,"
"[07:56] me013 | Chuck is gonna be going to a meeting at NIST ,"
"[08:00] me013 | in , uh , about a month and a half , I guess . They 're still working out the date ."
[08:05] me013 | cuz they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff since they 're going to be doing
"[08:13] me013 | a bunch of meeting recordings there . And so , uh ."
[08:14] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[08:31] me013 | So .
"[08:37] me013 | uh uh uh uh , it 's not a it 's not a conference . It 's not a workshop , really . It 's just connecting with them ."
[08:40] me011 | Right .
[08:44] me013 | So .
"[08:50] me013 | they 'll have training sets and test sets , and and all that all that stuff , and But ."
"[08:56] mn017 | But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap , for instance ."
[09:01] me011 | Right .
[09:02] me013 | Yeah .
[09:03] fe016 | What 's the plan if were we still going to be like a center for transcribing data ? What happens if
[09:09] fe016 | th they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources or ?
[09:14] me013 | I
[09:24] me011 | Yep .
"[09:29] me013 | path is looking , you know , more promising ."
[09:32] me011 | It it pretty good . Yeah .
[09:33] fe016 | Hmm .
"[09:33] me013 | And if that 's the case and if it turns out that , uh , it 's really a relatively small amount of time"
"[09:39] me013 | for our transcribers to process things before and after , if they really have taken out enough of the of the , uh ,"
"[09:47] me013 | uh , work that that it 's f feasible , then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year ."
[09:52] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
"[10:02] me013 | this work . Um , other funding may come ."
"[10:05] me013 | You know that 's But but if we wanna just count on , uh ,"
"[10:09] me013 | uh , what we know about , it 's it 's more modest than this year . Uh , it 's still there 'll still be money ,"
"[10:16] me013 | um , so I would see us as probably not doing more recordings at least for for for meetings or or digits or anything ."
"[10:24] me013 | But , uh , if if we feel that we need to , probably still doing some recordings for SmartKom or something ."
[10:30] mn014 | Yeah .
"[10:37] me013 | uh , I guess we have an u unknown rate . If it if it starts being if they 're generating this huge amount and we can't"
"[10:44] me013 | handle it then , you know , we 'll tell them ."
[10:48] me013 | But .
"[10:50] me013 | Uh , although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier , it it 's in some ways a good thing , because we 've been ironing out this path ."
"[10:59] me011 | Um . Well , I got a email from one of the UW guys . They want to record the meetings at higher , uh , sampling rate than sixteen kilohertz . Uh ,"
"[11:09] me011 | I didn't ask why . But it seems to me that really doesn't matter . If they have the disk space to do it ,"
[11:15] me011 | it seems that that is not a big deal .
[11:19] me011 | I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion
[11:22] me011 | about mismatched rates .
"[11:29] fe008 | Can't we downsample and , uh , transcribe on that basis ?"
[11:31] me013 | That would be the hope . Yeah . d Are they doing some nice integer multiple or ?
[11:32] me011 | Yep .
[11:35] me011 | Excuse me ?
[11:38] me011 | No .
"[11:39] me011 | No . No , no , it was like forty something . Forty - four , forty - two ."
[11:40] fe016 | Could Forty - eight ? Forty forty - four ? Yeah . CD - ROM . Yeah .
[11:42] me001 | F
"[11:43] me001 | So , CD ."
[11:44] mn014 | CD . Yeah .
[11:44] me011 | Yeah .
"[11:44] me013 | Oh , forty - four point one ."
[11:45] fe016 | Forty - four .
[11:45] me001 | Forty - four one .
[11:46] mn014 | Yeah .
[11:47] fe016 | S
[11:47] me013 | Yeah .
[11:47] me011 | Something like that .
[11:53] me011 | And then we downsample . Yep .
[11:54] me001 | But forty - eight 's a nice multiple of eight .
[11:56] me013 | Yeah .
[11:58] me013 | Well you can do it .
"[11:58] me001 | You can do it , I think ."
[11:59] fe016 | easy ? Yeah ? It 's not lossy ?
"[12:00] me013 | Oh , absolutely you can do it . Yeah . You can do you can go from anything to anything else ."
[12:01] me001 | You c y
[12:03] me013 | But but it 's it 's just it 's it 's just a little more complicated .
[12:04] me011 | You get aliasing .
[12:11] me013 | Yeah . So u u u
"[12:17] me011 | Well , the the only thought was if we 're gonna do a combined corpus , does it really matter if some 's sampled at one rate and some 's sampled at the other ? My feeling is no , it doesn't ."
"[12:27] me011 | Your audio , u these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that ."
"[12:31] me011 | But I just wanted to double check with other people before I told them "" yeah , no problem "" ."
[12:39] me018 | Why are why are they asking us ?
[12:41] me011 | I don't know .
"[12:42] me011 | Why are they asking us ? Because , you know , we 're sort of doing the corpus , so they want to be as similar as possible ."
"[12:49] me011 | So . But I think the answer is , if if we tell him "" no , that 's not alright "" , what he 'll probably say is "" well , we 're gonna do it anyway "" . But , uh ,"
[12:49] mn017 | It could be interesting .
[12:54] me018 | Well that 's that 's why I 'm asking .
[12:58] me001 | Yeah .
[12:58] me011 | Uh . Yep .
[12:59] me001 | It 's kind of a s
"[13:02] me011 | Oh , and they just don't want to downsample ?"
[13:02] fe016 | Yeah .
"[13:04] me001 | Well , someone 's gonna have to downsample ."
[13:10] mn014 | Yeah .
[13:10] me013 | I I I think it 's the sort of thing that 's deserving of discussion
[13:14] me011 | OK .
[13:19] mn017 | I mean that 's wha
"[13:21] me013 | it it 's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things . And it 's ,"
[13:21] mn017 | That 's like three times three times as much disk space .
[13:22] me001 | Yeah . It 's four or five times .
[13:25] mn014 | Yeah .
[13:26] me001 | Depends what you save .
"[13:26] me013 | um ,"
"[13:28] me013 | You know , part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there 's something , you know , say , in six to ten kilohertz that"
"[13:35] me013 | you might use for for some purposes somewhere . If people are doing a wide range of things , doing location ,"
"[13:41] me013 | uh , you know , doing a bunch of things , maybe , you know , why why throw it away if you don't need to ?"
"[13:46] me013 | Um , on the other hand , um , I mean ,"
[13:53] me011 | Yep . That 's wh that 's what I thought .
[13:53] me001 | Yeah .
"[13:59] me013 | And they are gonna be using up a lot of disk , both for th them and for us when we 're pr processing their stuff , uh , if they"
[14:02] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[14:07] me011 | Yep . Yep .
"[14:08] me013 | Well , i w wa if if they 're going at forty - four , they won't even creep . They 'll just pounce ."
[14:15] me018 | How many channels ?
"[14:18] me011 | Um , I don't remember what their hardware set - up was but it was smaller than ours ."
"[14:23] me013 | Well , that might help a bit ."
[14:24] me011 | Yeah .
[14:30] me011 | they 're they 're in a different situation cuz they 're doing video .
[14:36] me001 | Hmm .
[14:38] me013 | I don't think that 's true .
[14:39] me011 | Really ?
[14:40] me013 | They 're recording fifty channels of mikes .
"[14:42] me011 | They 're not recording all fifty of the array . They 're they 're cooking it down , aren't they ?"
"[14:46] me013 | Yeah , they are ."
"[14:46] fe016 | Yeah . They were g they said they were gonna record @ @ I don't know if there were fifty , but there were definitely above , like , twenty ."
[14:48] me013 | They 're recording all of them .
[14:51] me013 | Yeah .
[14:52] me011 | That 's funny . I thought that they were cooking down that data in some way before they were storing it .
[14:52] fe016 | It was it was high .
[14:54] me013 | I don't believe so . No . I don't think so .
[14:58] me013 | No . So I think they they have actually a very large audio data rate . I think it is comparable to a video data rate .
[15:08] me018 | How in the world are they gonna ever distribute this ?
"[15:08] me011 | Yeah , distributing They 're not going to ."
[15:16] me011 | You 'll have to just work on little subsets of it . There 's just no way you could get it all .
"[15:22] me018 | if we collect say a hundred meetings and each meeting is just the audio , compressed audio 's half a gig , so there 's fifty gigs just for our corpus ."
[15:29] me011 | Yep .
[15:33] me001 | That 's eight kilohertz ?
[15:33] me013 | And that 's and that 's and that 's no video .
[15:35] me011 | Sixteen .
[15:35] mn014 | Sixteen .
[15:35] me018 | That 's sixteen .
[15:35] fe016 | Sixteen .
[15:36] me001 | Sixteen .
"[15:37] me018 | And so ,"
"[15:38] me013 | Sample rate , yeah ."
"[15:38] fe016 | You just get , like ,"
"[15:39] me001 | Oh , it 's shortened . Oh , OK ."
[15:41] mn014 | Yeah . It 's shortened .
[15:42] me001 | And then shortened .
[15:42] mn014 | Yeah .
"[15:49] me013 | Yeah , not if you have to distribute the video also ."
[15:49] me011 | Two or three ?
[15:51] me018 | If you use both sides and the two layer and all that .
[15:53] me011 | It 's a lot more than that . Right ? DVD is eight gig ?
"[15:57] me013 | Well , I think you 'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there . I mean , how are they gonna you know , what 's what 's the distribution plan ?"
[15:57] me018 | S seventeen . @ @
[16:03] me018 | Mm - hmm .
"[16:03] me013 | If they have something really smart in mind , you know , maybe we can use it . I mean I mean ,"
[16:09] me011 | I think that 's definitely the right way to do it .
[16:11] me011 | Someone sends us disk . We we load it with data and send it back . It 's gonna be easier than any other method .
[16:18] mn017 | Huh .
"[16:24] me011 | Well , yeah ."
[16:24] fe016 | Hmm .
"[16:25] me011 | Yeah , absolutely . If they have a way of doing it . I 'm thinking prior to that ."
"[16:29] fe016 | Was there ever any talk of taking the , um ,"
[16:30] mn017 | Linguistic Data Consortium .
[16:31] me001 | Mmm .
[16:32] fe016 | close - talking mikes when people aren't talking and deleting those portions ? Or is the breathing and things ?
[16:36] me011 | We already do that . Shorten does that automatically .
[16:38] fe016 | Yeah ? OK .
[16:39] me011 | That 's why you why that 's why Shorten that 's why Shorten reduces the size so much .
"[16:42] fe016 | I see . Yeah , that 's true ."
[16:44] me013 | That 's why it 's only fifty gigs .
[16:45] me011 | Right .
[16:46] fe016 | OK . So it 's still really big even if you 're only one person or two people at most are actually talking all the time .
[16:52] me011 | Yep .
[16:53] fe016 | Wow .
[16:53] mn017 | We should just talk less .
[16:55] fe016 | Have shorter meetings !
[16:57] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:00] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:03] me011 | Hmm .
[17:05] me011 | It 's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short .
"[17:06] fe016 | Thanks , Morgan ."
"[17:09] mn014 | It 's really short , yeah . Yeah ."
[17:12] mn014 | Yeah .
"[17:23] me011 | uh , don't compress nearly as well because they 're almost always have signal on them ."
"[17:26] me013 | Yeah , that 's probably a lot of it . And they 're gonna have mikes like that too . In fact , their array their array will be Yeah ."
[17:27] mn014 | Yeah .
[17:29] me001 | Yeah .
[17:29] me011 | Yep .
[17:30] me011 | Most of them .
[17:30] me001 | All of them are like that .
[17:31] me011 | Yep .
[17:32] me011 | So they won't shorten nearly as well .
[17:35] me011 | And I assume they 're gonna do it lossless .
"[17:37] mn017 | for distribution purposes it might make sense to split it by channel ,"
[17:37] me011 | Yeah .
"[17:41] mn017 | uh , rather than by meetings . So ,"
"[17:45] mn017 | you could distribute , like , only the near - field signals , uh , uh , uh , together for a bunch of meetings and then have a second row ."
[17:47] me011 | Yep . Absolutely .
[17:51] me011 | And then maybe one far - field . You know ?
[17:56] mn017 | Mmm .
[17:59] me013 | Yeah .
"[17:59] me011 | How are we on disk space , Chuck ?"
"[18:09] me018 | uh , on the one disk that we 're using ."
[18:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[18:13] me018 | we ' v we 've still got , uh , quite a bit of space on the , uh , un - backed - up ."
"[18:18] me018 | So . But I I think it 's probably we should start thinking about where to go next , especially on the backed - up disk space ."
[18:19] me011 | Good .
"[18:26] me013 | Now we bought a little not all that long ago we brought three uh , thirty - six gigabyte disks ."
[18:29] me018 | That 's the un - backed - up .
[18:31] me018 | Yeah . Those are the u
"[18:32] me011 | Yeah , we 're using those for the for the expanded ."
[18:35] me013 | Uh - huh .
[18:48] me018 | So .
"[18:48] me013 | So I think after that we need another , uh , rack or something . Right ?"
"[18:51] me018 | Have to change servers , actually ."
[18:53] me013 | Change servers ?
"[18:54] me018 | Well , we could we could There are a bunch of disks that we have ,"
[19:03] me018 | get some extra space out of that . But the s right now the server 's full . We couldn't add any more disks . We could change a smaller disk for a larger one .
[19:17] me018 | Yeah .
[19:17] mn014 | Yeah .
[19:18] me018 | Yeah .
[19:19] me013 | shuffle it around .
[19:26] fe008 | Mm - hmm .
[19:27] me011 | because that takes about a day to get off back - up tape .
[19:30] me013 | Oh .
"[19:30] me018 | Well , then there 's the other issue is that to g to g"
[19:31] me011 | So .
"[19:33] me018 | add more disk now , um , David says we really need to go to new servers . But"
"[19:38] me018 | he wants to go to new servers not just for us but for other groups too . So there 's this sort of coordination issue , and"
[19:40] me011 | For u the whole institute . Yeah .
"[19:47] me011 | Actually , going to bigger disks we can do even , and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions . You just partition them into multiple ."
[19:53] mn014 | Yeah .
[19:55] me018 | Yeah .
"[19:55] me011 | So that 's probably the next step , is to get"
[19:55] me013 | That 's right .
[19:58] me011 | the eighty or ninety gig drives to replace the thirty gig or an eighteen gig that we have now .
[20:03] me013 | There are eighty gig drives now that you can get for that ?
[20:04] me011 | Yeah . Yeah .
[20:19] me013 | Yeah .
"[20:19] me018 | Well , when they come out with an"
[20:19] me011 | Is is the areal density of the microdrive higher than of a w normal drive ? It must be .
[20:24] me018 | When they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we 'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data .
[20:27] me011 | Yep .
[20:27] mn014 | Yeah .
"[20:28] me013 | Yeah . That 's what I meant , yeah ."
[20:44] me011 | Yep .
[20:45] me013 | that has one of these drives in it and just send the computer around to the different sites . And you can just get it off the computer and press the Yeah .
[20:50] me001 | Put the computer on tour ?
[20:52] me011 | Yeah . A laptop .
[20:52] fe008 | Hmm .
"[20:53] me013 | Laptop ? Yeah , send the laptop ."
[20:53] mn014 | Yeah .
[20:54] me011 | Eighty gig laptop .
"[21:05] me011 | It uh , uh , unfortunately it takes me a week at each site ."
[21:06] me013 | Johnny Appleseed . Yeah .
[21:08] me013 | What ?
[21:08] me011 | It does take a week at each site . So .
[21:09] me013 | Does it ?
[21:23] me013 | I 'm probably pr mispronouncing it . Well .
[21:33] me011 | Definitely true .
[21:36] me013 | OK .
[21:36] me011 | Any other items ?
"[21:37] me013 | So . OK , so that 's the meeting stuff . Uh , transcrip So you 're we 're you said it was almost half , so that means that we have , like , eighty or so hours and out of that maybe thirty - five or something are transcribed ?"
"[21:52] me018 | uh it combines the categories of , you know , "" currently in """
"[21:57] me018 | Oh ! Well , I 've got it right there , I think ."
"[22:00] me018 | Yeah . There 's there 's just a few , uh ,"
"[22:05] me018 | Um . Yeah , except I I 'm tethered . Uh ,"
[22:06] me011 | D d do we care ?
"[22:07] me013 | He 's tethered , yeah ."
[22:09] me018 | OK .
"[22:10] me018 | It combines categories . So when we say "" transcribed "" , we mean either in the process of being transcribed , either here or at IBM ,"
[22:16] me013 | Oh .
[22:17] me013 | Yeah .
"[22:18] me018 | or completed transcription ,"
"[22:29] me011 | We need different color pens , definitely ."
"[22:31] me013 | Oh , that 's Yeah , that 's not half . Yeah ."
[22:37] me018 | That one that you have ?
"[22:38] fe008 | Oh , I 'm not sure . The one that I saw on the web when I came back ."
[22:44] me018 | Yeah .
"[22:46] me018 | the date on this one is July twenty - sixth , so , uh , I have to update it . Yeah ."
[22:50] me013 | A couple weeks ago . Yeah .
[22:52] fe008 | OK .
"[22:54] me018 | So we have total number of meetings is seventy - eight meetings and ,"
[22:57] me013 | Mmm .
[22:57] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:00] me018 | uh ,"
"[23:02] me018 | uh , the total meeting time is seventy - five hours ."
"[23:11] me018 | the ones that are finished being transcribed , as opposed to in the process of being transcribed we 've got twenty - six hours that are"
[23:17] me011 | Oh ! Great .
[23:18] me018 | finished being transcribed .
"[23:18] me001 | What does that mean , "" finished being transcribed "" ?"
"[23:27] me018 | I it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber ,"
"[23:30] me018 | to them finishing transcription , to then being checked , you know , with a double - check ."
[23:34] me001 | Mm - hmm .
"[23:35] me018 | And so , when we say the total transcribed , that 's the one that 's gone through being checked , I believe ."
[23:43] me001 | OK .
[23:43] mn014 | Just not yet approved for Yeah ? OK .
"[23:44] me018 | But not yet approved . And then there 's , uh the final one is approved for release . That 's after the meeting participants have gone through it ."
"[23:49] me011 | So I should probably send those to you , shouldn't I ?"
[23:51] me001 | Oh .
[23:51] fe008 | Yes . At present there 's n none of those are on the pie chart .
"[23:52] me018 | Yeah , if you know ."
[23:56] me011 | There are five .
[23:58] me018 | Huh ?
"[23:58] me011 | There are five . We have five where , uh , everyone has replied ."
[23:58] fe008 | There 're five ? Good .
[24:00] me018 | OK .
[24:01] me018 | OK . So we have five that are potentially releasable then .
"[24:09] fe008 | I mean , it 's this is the it 's - it 's been tran"
[24:10] me018 | Yeah . That 's approval in progress . Yeah .
[24:11] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[24:23] fe008 | it 's more than a And so these right here have been through the double - check . These haven't .
[24:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[24:33] me013 | Yeah .
[24:35] me013 | OK .
[24:40] me013 | the IBM thing will will help push through the the rest of it somewhat quicker .
[24:47] me013 | OK .
"[24:53] me011 | have never gotten a response from from any of the emails about , uh permission forms . So ."
[25:01] me011 | Yep .
[25:02] me011 | That 's so that 's why the NSA ones have still not been approved .
[25:06] me011 | Though .
[25:07] fe008 | Those will figure less prominently in things anyway .
[25:09] me011 | Yep .
[25:11] me013 | Yeah . It might it might partly just be European summer vacation issues .
[25:25] me013 | Right . Hmm . OK .
"[25:29] me013 | Uh , www . What else is going on ?"
[25:34] mn014 | Didn't you wanna say something about the hardware set - up ?
"[25:36] me011 | Oh , that 's right . Uh ."
"[25:38] me011 | Yeah , we have new hardware . So , I want to set it up at some point , so I just wanted to know what meeting schedules were ."
"[25:44] me011 | Uh , we have several more wireless channels so that we can set up and get rid of these , uh the wired stuff completely ."
[25:45] fe016 | Huh .
[25:48] me013 | Oh .
[25:53] fe016 | Oh . Really ?
[25:55] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[25:55] me013 | So , wha what 's your question ?"
[25:55] me011 | Yeah .
[25:55] me001 | Oh .
[25:55] fe016 | Are they like
"[25:56] me011 | Yeah , they 're like those . Those are the only two choices right now , unfortunately ."
"[25:57] fe016 | these , right ? OK ."
[26:00] me013 | So what 's your question ?
"[26:08] me013 | Well , there 's a point when a bunch of us are off at Eurospeech ."
[26:12] me013 | Um .
[26:15] mn014 | Nothing this week . Maybe n end of next week .
[26:18] me011 | End of next week . And is EDU still recording ?
[26:21] fe016 | They usually do Thursdays .
"[26:23] fe016 | I don't get a lot of advance notice , but"
[26:26] fe016 | it 's al always been either Mondays or Thursdays . So .
[26:28] me018 | Thursdays ?
[26:30] fe016 | Yeah . They they often do it after for a while they were doing it after this meeting .
"[26:32] me011 | So if I did it , like , tomorrow that would be alright it sounds like ? OK ."
[26:33] me018 | Oh !
[26:38] me011 | So it sounds like no one n
"[26:38] fe016 | Definitely Wed - Definitely Wednesday I 'm not here , so I don't record anything ."
[26:40] me011 | No one early next week .
"[26:42] mn014 | Yeah . Let me check with Robert again , but I I 'm pretty sure that there 's nothing this week ."
[26:47] me011 | OK .
[26:49] me013 | OK .
[26:50] me011 | And then I 'll also re - number
"[26:52] me011 | so that , uh , the mikes are in order ."
"[26:55] fe008 | Oh , thank you . Thank you . Mmm ."
[26:57] me013 | OK .
[26:57] me011 | Should help with the transcripts .
[27:00] me011 | They wer so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous .
[27:04] me018 | Hmm .
[27:05] me011 | Right .
"[27:05] fe008 | Yeah . I mean , you know , it 's an extra step ."
[27:05] mn014 | Yeah .
[27:09] me013 | OK .
"[27:14] me013 | what 's other things that are going on , maybe , since we don't don't have much of a set a set agenda and we don't have much time ."
[27:20] me013 | Uh .
"[27:24] me011 | OK , we 'll all say what we 're doing at the same time ."
"[27:35] fe016 | I mean , people could , like , backchannel"
[27:39] me013 | Yeah .
"[27:39] me013 | I 'll I 'll I 'll keep saying "" uh - huh "" . Yeah ."
[27:39] fe016 | OK .
[27:41] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[27:54] me013 | With my backchannel ?
[27:55] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[27:58] mn017 | this this "" uh - huh "" that you don't n"
[28:02] fe016 | Uh - huh .
"[28:05] me011 | Which "" uh - huh "" ?"
[28:06] mn014 | Yeah .
[28:12] mn014 | Yeah .
[28:16] me001 | Yeah . Let 's get rid of them .
[28:26] me013 | What are we doing ?
[28:28] me013 | Yeah .
[28:31] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[28:36] me011 | Well , I mean , Trans - What happened was that Transcriber 's very slow to load ."
"[28:39] me011 | So when you have a big meeting it c uh , especially on a slower machine , it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything ."
[28:42] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:45] me011 | And so I was thinking about why that was and the data structures I would use , and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it . So I did ."
[28:50] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[28:51] me011 | And so I have a big chunk of Transcriber now written in Java and it comes up , you know , in a couple of seconds . Um ."
[28:56] me001 | Cool .
[28:56] fe016 | Great .
[28:57] fe016 | Great .
[28:59] fe016 | Y y yeah . W we should talk to you off - line about something .
[29:03] me011 | probably not worth doing . But we can talk about it .
[29:04] mn017 | s
"[29:04] mn017 | Well , actually , I think it is worth doing because here 's the thing . We 're sort of we 're starting to move from transcription to annotation ."
[29:06] fe016 | Yeah .
[29:11] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[29:11] mn017 | And the Transcriber interface is fine if essentially what you 're doing is
[29:17] mn017 | stringing words together to p
[29:18] me011 | Yep .
[29:19] mn017 | to make transcripts .
"[29:32] mn017 | with , uh , you know , basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling ."
[29:35] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[29:49] fe016 | In other words , the beginning of something could be one speaker and the end of that unit , like question - answer pair , could be a different speaker ."
"[29:56] fe016 | That 's why we can't just annotate the transcripts , uh , one listening to one at a time ."
[30:03] me011 | Mm - hmm .
[30:10] me011 | Yeah .
"[30:11] fe016 | encode someth Yeah , exactly . So ."
[30:11] me011 | I un I understand the problem . So .
"[30:15] mn017 | actually a good model , which is what this current tool that we 're using has , is to atta to associate these"
"[30:21] mn017 | labels with , um , attributes of SGML tags ."
[30:24] me011 | Mm - hmm .
"[30:25] mn017 | So , you know , you have , say , a tag for I don't know what type of utterance , whether it 's a question or a statement or whatever . And then"
"[30:33] mn017 | you have an , uh you know , an a tag attribute and the value of that encodes the choice ."
[30:36] me011 | Right .
[30:38] me011 | Right .
[30:39] me011 | So what I don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles and it display wavefiles . I just haven't done that since
"[30:46] mn017 | Oh , you mean display as in showing the waveform ? OK ."
[30:48] me011 | Yep .
[30:49] me011 | Yep .
[30:54] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[30:55] me011 | But it works .
"[30:56] me013 | What 's , uh , the original Transcriber written in ?"
[30:58] me011 | Tcl - TK .
[30:59] me013 | I see .
[31:01] me011 | So .
[31:01] me013 | So .
"[31:02] me011 | Which is nice and flexible but very , very slow in comparison ."
"[31:03] me013 | Yeah , yeah . Right ."
"[31:10] me011 | Yep , SAX ."
[31:11] me018 | Reading SAX . Yeah .
[31:12] me011 | Cuz it 's much faster than DOM and uses less memory .
[31:14] me018 | Right .
[31:16] me011 | So .
[31:18] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[31:19] me011 | preparing for quals . Uh ,"
[31:28] me013 | Beep .
[31:32] me018 | Who was that ?
"[31:35] me011 | So anyway . So I 've been preparing for that . And , uh ,"
"[31:39] me011 | actually , I wanted to"
[31:41] me011 | say off - line with you about any literature reviews I should do beforehand .
"[31:46] me013 | "" War and Peace . """
"[31:47] me011 | "" War and Peace . "" That 's a good choice . Keep me busy ."
[31:47] me013 | Yeah .
"[31:50] fe016 | It 's actually not a bad idea to say "" beep "" as a word because you can search the transcripts , y you know ,"
"[31:55] fe016 | for for that , to find these places ."
"[31:56] me011 | For "" beep "" . That 's a good idea ."
"[31:57] fe016 | No , I 'm s I 'm totally serious . To have one word , like "" beep "" , especially with a really long "" eee "" like that ."
"[31:59] me011 | No , absolutely . I agree ."
[32:02] me013 | Yeah .
[32:04] fe016 | Works great .
[32:10] me013 | OK .
"[32:12] mn014 | Yeah . I 've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on meeting data with different , uh ,"
"[32:18] mn014 | segmentations with different different automatic segmentations , but it 's not yet finished . It 's work in progress ."
[32:26] me013 | OK . Any sense about how how it does on ?
"[32:28] mn014 | Yeah . For , uh for for the paper I w I want to submit to ASRU to to ,"
"[32:34] mn014 | uh , evaluate the quality of the speech - nonspeech detection by using it for speech recognition ."
"[32:45] me013 | maybe you already did this experiment , where there 's this question of of how much it hurt you or helped you to use segmented"
[32:55] mn017 | i i
[32:56] mn017 | the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts .
[32:59] mn014 | Yeah .
"[33:06] mn014 | So , it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation , when you have the the manual segmentations , where you have exact boundaries for each s utterances ."
"[33:14] mn014 | Sometimes there are some some words are cut off or there 's some segments i are s uh , assigned to s to speech which there is nothing in . And so there are more insertions but"
[33:28] mn014 | most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one .
[33:33] me011 | Hmm !
"[33:35] mn014 | And so I 'm just in in progress of ,"
"[33:38] mn014 | yeah , trying to feed the recognizer with un - segmented data and to see how much worse that is ."
"[33:45] mn014 | So that that I have three things . Un - yeah un - segmented , the automatic , and the the ideal one ."
[33:47] me013 | Yeah .
[33:54] mn014 | Yeah .
[34:00] me013 | @ @
"[34:00] me001 | Um . Yeah , I just got back from Chicago . So ."
"[34:05] me001 | Um , fishing went pretty well ."
"[34:05] me011 | Oh , yeah . All of us are banging ."
[34:07] me013 | Good . Good .
"[34:07] me001 | And , um , I was gonna post some results , you know , with , uh ,"
[34:10] fe016 | Wisconsin fishing .
[34:11] me011 | With fishing . B
[34:11] me001 | Wisconsin fishing . Yeah .
[34:12] me013 | Yeah .
[34:13] me001 | Uh .
"[34:16] me001 | Y who Yeah , right . Whose result ?"
"[34:18] me013 | Bush 's . Yeah , you 're both , you know , sort of He 's he 's coming back to the heartland and Right . Yeah ."
"[34:22] me001 | Yeah , right , exactly . I did my tour of the heartland . Yeah ."
[34:24] me018 | Did you build any houses ?
"[34:25] me001 | Yeah . I built a few built a few houses . Um ,"
"[34:29] me001 | but right now I guess , uh , I 'm working on this"
[34:47] me001 | annotations and we re re - ran ali re - ran alignments . And we 're gonna develop a new feature database based on those alignments
[34:54] me001 | and do some trees and analysis . So I 'm kind of in the middle of that .
[34:58] me001 | And
[35:05] me001 | Yeah . We 'll have it all straightened out .
[35:06] mn017 | Yeah .
[35:07] me001 | So . It 's gonna be a busy week .
[35:08] mn017 | Yeah .
"[35:11] mn017 | You know , Bush went on this European trip recently and"
[35:13] me001 | Hmm .
[35:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[35:22] me013 | Yeah . I I think he 's b he 's been he will have been off , like , two months out of his first seven in office . That 's a pretty good deal ."
[35:27] me001 | Yeah . It 's amazing .
[35:27] mn017 | Yeah . It 's hard to keep
"[35:30] me018 | Don't even really notice , do you ?"
[35:35] mn017 | Um .
"[35:43] me013 | Who are you talking about , Bush or Don ? Yeah ."
"[36:03] mn017 | we just had a phone call with Mari and her students , in fact , and they want to , um ,"
"[36:10] mn017 | e m They 're bringing up their own meeting recognizer , which is based on Bill Byrne 's , uh , recognizer from Johns Hopkins ."
[36:13] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:17] me013 | Based on Hub - five , or like like your ?"
"[36:19] mn017 | Based on their Hub - five recognizer . And ,"
[36:19] fe016 | Mm - hmm .
[36:20] me013 | Yeah .
[36:29] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[36:32] mn017 | uh , transcripts annotated with events , uh , like sentence boundaries and stuff like that ."
[36:35] me013 | Mm - hmm .
[36:37] me013 | Yeah .
[36:44] me013 | Yeah .
"[36:46] fe016 | Yeah . Actually we had this ide from the last time that they were here , that it 'd be nice to have UW do some work on language modeling that would be"
[36:54] fe016 | trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically since they can ramp up much ques quicker in the language modeling and we don
[36:57] mn017 | Hmm .
"[37:01] fe016 | you know , we 'll do the , uh , prosodic side . And so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually integrate"
"[37:06] fe016 | the posteriors that they get from their language model for every word boundary or every frame boundary , and then train up the classifiers ."
[37:10] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:13] fe016 | And it 's I guess it 's an undergrad , too , that that 's going to be doing this work . So ."
[37:13] me001 | Cool .
[37:16] mn017 | Yeah .
"[37:17] mn017 | Um , on the recognition side , actually , um , I think the main person doing that is , uh , Harriet from Harriet Nock from , uh formerly of Cambridge ."
[37:24] me013 | Yeah .
"[37:33] mn017 | even higher than we get with with the , um like even , you know , on lapel mikes with , uh ,"
"[37:43] mn017 | It could be that our recognizer 's actually doing relatively well because it has a reject model for , you know , mismatched speech , essentially ,"
[37:53] me013 | Oh !
"[38:02] mn017 | you know , their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that . So , um , we 'll see what that , uh , leads to ."
"[38:12] mn017 | Yeah . Other than that , uh ,"
"[38:16] mn017 | we 're Well , that 's pretty m pretty much it as far as meetings are concerned ."
"[38:24] me013 | So I should mention , Dave and I have sort of been pushing through thinking in terms of an ASRU paper . But I 'm still @ @"
[38:38] me011 | Hmm !
"[38:46] me013 | where , um ,"
"[38:55] me013 | Um , we had what looked like a good result in digits but th but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away ."
[39:00] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:01] me013 | So , uh , the digits result right now is kind of equivocal ."
[39:04] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:05] me013 | Um , but the conversational speech one , while not huge , is in sort of Hub - five or Meeting kind of terms , actually it 's it 's it 's not bad . You know ?"
[39:12] mn017 | Hmm .
"[39:14] me013 | So So it 's it 's you know , it 's like ,"
[39:16] me013 | i i w
[39:21] me011 | Yeah . It 's a P H D .
"[39:26] mn017 | But is it still true that basically the s speaker adaptation , um ,"
[39:32] mn017 | sort of negates much of the advantage ?
[39:35] mn017 | With it .
[39:35] me013 | Without the adapt without the adaptation is a much bigger effect .
[39:37] mn017 | OK .
[39:38] me013 | So it so it 's it 's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind o kind of improvement .
[39:44] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[39:44] me013 | But I think what w ultimately what we have to face with it is that , um I mean , he gets incredibly good results"
"[39:50] me013 | if you artificially reverberate clean you know , close close - miked data . So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model"
[39:53] me011 | Right .
[39:58] me013 | for what 's going on is is wrong
[39:59] me011 | Is it wrong ?
[40:01] mn017 | Right .
[40:02] me013 | and that in this situation in particular there 's a lot of noise .
[40:06] mn017 | Right .
"[40:13] me013 | @ @ been thinking of doing , is there 's a whole lot of work that 's been going on in noise suppression in the in the Aurora , uh , team ."
[40:32] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[40:35] me013 | So , uh um ."
[40:36] mn017 | Yeah .
[40:38] me011 | Neat .
[40:41] me013 | So we 're working on that .
[40:41] mn017 | OK .
"[40:50] mn017 | Do you remember this paper or poster by , um , some CMU folks at , uh , HLT ?"
"[41:03] mn017 | Some - someone in Karlsruhe , I think , um , worked on ,"
"[41:13] mn017 | uh , doing some explicit I don't know if it 's something akin to parallel model combination or something like that to to , uh ,"
"[41:21] me013 | I mean , people have done that for a long time . Right ?"
"[41:33] me013 | Yeah , I don I don't remember the paper . But I mean , that th that 's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that ."
[41:34] mn017 | Right .
[41:36] mn017 | Right .
"[41:38] me013 | Uh , and in all th the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at"
"[41:42] me013 | regions that you think are nonspeech in order to get noise statistics . But ,"
[41:43] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[41:46] mn017 | Right .
"[41:46] me013 | uh , I mean , there 's a host of thing different things you could do . In the Aurora thing , we have we have a little bit of a handicap in that they they don't let you ,"
"[41:53] me013 | uh , adjust the tis the statistical models . So y you have to you have to do everything at the feature level ."
[41:55] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[42:09] me013 | m minor modifications of one another . Um .
[42:18] me013 | has this sort of general framework for a for it so that you can adjust it to sort of an any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing and
[42:26] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
[42:26] me013 | they found a particular set of parameters they liked this week . And we 're running with that for a while . But .
[42:31] mn017 | OK .
[42:36] me013 | Anything else ?
"[42:48] fe016 | given all information up to whatever point in time you 're considering , try to predict if that 's a good location for someone else to jump in ."
"[42:56] fe016 | So , that 's the idea of that paper . And that 's the same task that Mari , a um , a student named Dustin , and also Sarah who was at this last meeting"
"[43:05] fe016 | will be looking into doing from the language modeling side . Maybe some kind of clu you know , clustered class N - gram or something ."
[43:09] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[43:12] fe016 | Um . And also we 're we 're using a couple of the labellers who are doing emotion to help us , um , finalize some transcripts for this . So these undergra undergrad students are really helping us out a lot ,"
[43:22] me001 | Yeah .
[43:34] fe016 | most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion and that 's going pretty well now .
[43:42] me013 | What kind of emotions do you label ?
[43:43] fe016 | Um .
"[43:44] fe016 | Well , we 're mostly looking for places where the person 's frustrated with the system ."
"[43:49] me013 | So , there 's just two categories , frustrated and not , or ? No ."
[43:53] me013 | Yeah .
"[43:58] fe016 | um , and "" disappointed - tired "" . Like , "" yeah , no , that 's wrong again "" ."
[43:58] me011 | @ @
[44:04] me013 | Yeah .
[44:06] me013 | Uh - huh .
"[44:10] fe016 | And then there 's jokes . And Yeah , right . Um ."
"[44:15] fe016 | There 's not a lot of enough frustration for us to really go through quickly , cuz we have to label every meeting and also things like repeats for the same information , and so forth . And I 've been coordinating a little bit with"
"[44:24] fe016 | Katrin at , uh , UW who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting ."
[44:31] fe016 | So there 's some overlap there in what you m there 's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration .
[44:38] me013 | Yeah .
"[44:46] fe016 | with Morgan 's help and , uh , Dan Ellis 's , I think , looking into spectral tilt a bit , so he can talk about that ."
"[44:52] fe016 | It 's a feature we haven't used before . Um , and starting to , uh , r r take information from alignments and"
"[45:04] fe016 | a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees , which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person 's frustrated or not ."
[45:14] fe016 | So .
[45:23] mn014 | I haven't really had time to do that .
"[45:24] fe016 | Actually , I wanted to talk with you about that cuz there 's a similar project at SRI where we 're using we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the p"
[45:26] mn014 | Yeah .
"[45:33] fe016 | stylized pitch stuff is ,"
[45:34] mn014 | Yeah .
"[45:36] fe016 | um ,"
"[45:38] fe016 | sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark . So , I I actually wanted to talk to you about that . So ."
[45:41] mn014 | Yeah .
[45:46] mn014 | Yeah . Yeah .
"[45:49] me013 | But that seemed like it would be fairly straight - forward , that if you take the take the pitch from the real data ,"
[45:49] mn014 | Yeah .
[45:52] mn014 | Yeah .
[45:53] fe016 | Right .
"[45:53] me013 | feed it into the synthesizer , and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data ."
[45:59] mn014 | Yeah .
[45:59] fe016 | Yeah . There was just no way to
[46:00] me013 | @ @
[46:04] mn017 | We have to do the English synthesis for SmartKom. What if we make the system really annoyed ?
"[46:10] fe016 | OK - Anyway . I I should move on cuz we 're running late , but I wanted to say there 's one question in my mind , which maybe"
[46:13] me013 | Yeah .
"[46:17] fe016 | Morgan can talk to Jeremy about , is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt . It 's just I 'm sort of in this ,"
"[46:23] fe016 | uh , area I don't know much about and so we should talk off - line . But if you have a certain speaker"
[46:25] me013 | OK .
[46:28] me013 | Mm - hmm .
"[46:28] fe016 | and you wanna sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it , you know , directly on a feature to to like a decision tree that won't"
[46:42] fe016 | what what makes sense to do with that feature ?
[46:44] fe016 | So .
[46:46] fe016 | i Yeah .
[46:47] fe016 | But that 's something we would be glad to have help on .
[46:52] me013 | OK .
"[47:02] me051 | And , um , I basically have three ways right now that we 're looking at for , uh we 're gonna look at for features ."
"[47:13] me051 | and , uh , using that ."
"[47:14] me051 | Um , another is looking at the log ener the difference of log energies between , um ,"
"[47:20] me051 | the high like a high - frequency band and a low - frequency band . And the third is just , um , taking a slope ,"
"[47:27] me051 | um , of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that ."
"[47:33] me051 | So , those are the three three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers . And ,"
[47:46] me051 | see which ones w seem to be working well . And things like that .
"[47:50] me051 | Um , I also recently wrote a script , um ,"
"[47:59] me051 | for labeller agreement . Um , so ,"
[48:02] mn014 | Yeah .
"[48:11] me013 | specifically , what you wanna do is remove the the the the average , uh , speaker tilt in some sense ?"
"[48:29] fe016 | But the problem is we don't know th we don't we don't know whether the "" no "" is frustrated or not ."
[48:36] fe016 | So Right . Exactly .
[48:36] me011 | Mmm .
"[48:44] fe016 | You wanna capture the change in voice quality within a speaker ,"
"[48:48] fe016 | without having to know ahead of time w which is which , cuz that would be circular . So ,"
"[48:53] me013 | m maybe maybe this is too obvious to be right , but I mean , the the the the normal thing for C - one would be to to , uh , get rid of the mean and th and the variance . Right ?"
[49:01] fe008 | To get rid of what ?
[49:02] me011 | Mean and variance .
[49:03] fe008 | OK .
[49:17] mn017 | I mean you can't just normalize it based on the utterance because then you 're gonna have zero everywhere .
"[49:23] me013 | No , ev everything for that speaker ."
[49:25] fe016 | Yeah .
[49:26] fe016 | Everything up to that point .
[49:30] me013 | Yeah ?
"[49:30] mn017 | where you only have access to the what the speaker said before . So it 'd have to be sort of a causal ,"
"[49:36] fe016 | Oh , yeah . That 's OK . That that 's the sort of w we keep you keep , uh , iterat you keep updating those numbers for future utterances . Th -"
"[49:36] mn017 | uh ,"
[49:38] mn017 | version of @ @ .
[49:42] me011 | Yeah .
[49:44] fe016 | That that would work .
"[49:46] me013 | the You 're right . I mean , the main distinction is whether it 's voiced or or voiced or not ."
"[49:49] me013 | If it 's if it 's if it 's silence or or unvoiced regions , then you you you don't really want that in there , uh , if you can help it ."
[49:50] fe016 | Yeah .
"[50:01] me013 | did you know , did that , it wouldn't be that bad ."
"[50:09] fe016 | You mean just a a Z - square , like ?"
"[50:13] fe016 | Right , right . Right . OK . So it is distributed in a way that you can do this . Yeah . OK ."
[50:18] fe016 | @ @
"[50:25] fe016 | maybe this will work , I don't know . OK ."
"[50:28] me013 | the next thing is , "" well , let 's just look at the voiced regions "" , you know , and that would be a reasonable thing to do ."
[50:34] me013 | And then if it 's really when you look at what y i i i
"[50:41] me013 | it 's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it 's Gaussian anyway . And so the other things that get more more tricky are ,"
"[50:48] me013 | uh , to handle the fact that it 's not not really Gaussian . And and y you may you may not really need that for this ."
"[50:52] fe016 | Well , we probably won't get that far . Yeah ."
[50:55] fe016 | OK .
[50:56] me013 | that would be that would be the obvious thing to do .
[50:57] fe016 | OK .
[51:01] mn017 | o o of the of the feature . Right ? We 're just gonna we we 're gonna use
[51:01] fe016 | Yeah .
[51:05] mn017 | like thresholding or something .
"[51:10] me013 | normalize for some kind of , uh , bias of some sort , you might use a non - parametric"
"[51:16] me013 | measure , like you might use a median , you know , and rank statistics , and all that sort of stuff . But I mean , you shouldn't bother with it if it 's roughly Gaussian . Just Yeah ."
"[51:17] fe016 | m Median , yeah . We could just plot plot these for a speaker , and"
[51:17] mn017 | Right .
[51:22] fe016 | get a bunch of histograms .
[51:23] mn017 | Right .
[51:24] mn017 | OK .
[51:25] fe016 | Right .
"[51:27] mn017 | Uh , yeah ."
"[51:30] me013 | Uh , and I already I already said what I was doing , which is mostly"
"[51:43] me013 | it 's a real learning experience for both of us . And and , uh , I think it 's it 's a problem ar problem area that people really haven't"
"[51:50] me013 | dealt with that much , as we know . So ,"
[52:02] me013 | it does work very well under some conditions and other conditions it doesn't . And now we 're understanding trying to understand what those are .
[52:04] mn017 | Mm - hmm .
"[52:20] me013 | You know , when Bush catches fish they actually put a bunch of fish in the lake for him ."
[52:26] me001 | It 's part of the budget .
[52:31] me013 | Really . They just they they pre - stocked it with with a a I 'm really not kidding .
[52:31] me011 | The Secret Service is out there throwing fish into the ocean into the lake .
"[52:35] me001 | They got , like , scuba gear on and , like , hooking them ."
[52:37] me011 | Hmm .
[52:44] me013 | Yeah . So we 're ready to increase our federal funding .
[52:47] me011 | I think we 're done .
"[52:52] me013 | Why why don't we ? Yeah , let 's do that ."
[53:03] me011 | Ready ?
[53:53] me011 | And we ' r

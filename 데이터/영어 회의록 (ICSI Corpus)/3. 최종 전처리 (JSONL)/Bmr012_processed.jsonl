{"timestamp": "12:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And I have to try it on the far field mike yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "13:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "actually in order to assess the forced alignment"}
{"timestamp": "13:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place ."}

{"timestamp": "13:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ye - right ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "13:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So this would be like if you take the words"}

{"timestamp": "13:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "13:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription ."}
{"timestamp": "13:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Maybe actually mark the word boundaries ."}
{"timestamp": "13:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh or i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say"}

{"timestamp": "14:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are ."}
{"timestamp": "14:06", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um but I think it 's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy ."}

{"timestamp": "14:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK"}

{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "that 's about it ."}

{"timestamp": "14:32", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:32", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "So the real value of the database is these ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , abso well no but"}
{"timestamp": "14:36", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps"}
{"timestamp": "14:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "This i yeah . This is not that good ."}
{"timestamp": "14:42", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "there 's probably overlaps in in"}
{"timestamp": "14:44", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so"}
{"timestamp": "14:47", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes"}
{"timestamp": "14:52", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe"}
{"timestamp": "14:57", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say"}

{"timestamp": "15:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}

{"timestamp": "15:07", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of"}

{"timestamp": "15:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the the text"}

{"timestamp": "25:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "digital channels ."}

{"timestamp": "25:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue ."}

{"timestamp": "26:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:29", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "requirements up a bit but"}

{"timestamp": "27:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "with just wires coming out the end"}
{"timestamp": "27:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself ."}
{"timestamp": "27:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece"}

{"timestamp": "28:05", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "uh wiring jobs fall apart in use"}
{"timestamp": "28:09", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them"}

{"timestamp": "28:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us , so ."}

{"timestamp": "28:20", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's this"}

{"timestamp": "29:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "29:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so ."}

{"timestamp": "29:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um"}
{"timestamp": "29:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , somehow . It 's not a bad idea ."}

{"timestamp": "30:21", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "30:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well I mean is the is the hand - held really any better ?"}

{"timestamp": "30:27", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "no it depends on the hand - held but hand many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it it is less"}

{"timestamp": "30:37", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "30:37", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk ."}

{"timestamp": "30:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "30:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK ."}
{"timestamp": "30:42", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "so"}
{"timestamp": "30:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I wonder if they have one that will hook up ."}

{"timestamp": "30:47", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "What ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves ."}
{"timestamp": "30:50", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Well , you wouldn't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:54", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "No that 's uh you need a transmitter ."}
{"timestamp": "30:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:56", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Is th isn't that built into the mike ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:57", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Oh I see . Get a get a different radio , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah just these ones that they"}
{"timestamp": "31:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "pass around with no you know wireless"}
{"timestamp": "31:05", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver ."}
{"timestamp": "31:05", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Have a little antenna coming out the bottom ."}
{"timestamp": "31:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , isn't it ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:11", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "But then the mike has to h"}
{"timestamp": "31:12", "speaker": "Speaker_I", "text": "Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of"}
{"timestamp": "31:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "31:15", "speaker": "Speaker_I", "text": "@ @"}
{"timestamp": "31:15", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:22", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I don't know . You 'll have to check with them , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK I 'll I 'll ask . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "It 's just a frequency ."}
{"timestamp": "31:24", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "But that 's that 's a great idea and then just sort of have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and and uh"}
{"timestamp": "31:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less"}
{"timestamp": "31:33", "speaker": "Speaker_I", "text": "Pretty soon ."}
{"timestamp": "31:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "interaction the less people are talking"}
{"timestamp": "31:39", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mmm , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um over each other it just there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and"}
{"timestamp": "31:45", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "31:50", "speaker": "Speaker_I", "text": "Um"}
{"timestamp": "31:51", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Off you go , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:51", "speaker": "Speaker_I", "text": "Gotta go ."}
{"timestamp": "31:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I I thought of some extra a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention ."}
{"timestamp": "31:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "32:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far ."}

{"timestamp": "32:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten ."}
{"timestamp": "32:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh"}
{"timestamp": "32:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh it 's great I j and this I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something so it 's really great"}

{"timestamp": "32:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Super idea ."}
{"timestamp": "32:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things , that 's a great idea ."}

{"timestamp": "32:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:38", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us so how do we do this , is the only thing ."}
{"timestamp": "32:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or just have them talk amongst themselves ."}
{"timestamp": "32:43", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Have them have their own meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "32:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well that 's what I 'm thinking , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And have"}
{"timestamp": "32:46", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "32:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Have them talk about the data"}
{"timestamp": "32:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "that would be great ."}

{"timestamp": "32:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think ."}
{"timestamp": "33:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That 's a great idea ."}

{"timestamp": "01:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "what should we do about digits that were misread ?"}
{"timestamp": "01:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "My opinion is ,"}
{"timestamp": "02:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um , we should just throw them out completely ,"}
{"timestamp": "02:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and have them read again by someone else ."}
{"timestamp": "02:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You know , the grouping is completely random , so it it 's perfectly fine to put a a group together again"}

{"timestamp": "02:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "just to finish out the test set ."}
{"timestamp": "02:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh ! By throw them out completely ?"}
{"timestamp": "02:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um , the other thing you could do is"}
{"timestamp": "02:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "change the transcript to match what they really said ."}
{"timestamp": "02:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So those are those are the two options ."}
{"timestamp": "02:21", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "02:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "What the transcribers did with that is if they did a correction ,"}

{"timestamp": "02:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Correct ."}
{"timestamp": "02:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "but then the transcript isn't the Aurora test set anymore ."}
{"timestamp": "02:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I don't think that really matters because the conditions are so different ."}
{"timestamp": "02:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that would be a little easier ."}
{"timestamp": "02:58", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Well how many are how how often does that happen ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Oh , so it 's not very much ."}
{"timestamp": "03:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , it 's not much at all ."}
{"timestamp": "03:04", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Seems like we should just change the transcripts"}

{"timestamp": "14:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And so if each one of those is a fixed length ,"}
{"timestamp": "14:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the sorting becomes a lot easier ."}
{"timestamp": "14:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "She wanted to keep them"}

{"timestamp": "15:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "15:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And as I said , the it 's we just don't have that many"}

{"timestamp": "15:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "that that 's a big deal ."}

{"timestamp": "15:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "at some point we have to"}

{"timestamp": "15:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "channels and stuff , so ,"}
{"timestamp": "15:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right . So the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names , I would change them to match . So instead of being MR one it would be MRM zero zero one . But I don't think that 's a big deal ."}

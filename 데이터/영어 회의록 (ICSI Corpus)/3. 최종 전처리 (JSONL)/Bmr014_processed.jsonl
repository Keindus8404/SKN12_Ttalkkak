{"timestamp": "04:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "04:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright so we 'll send out agenda request ."}

{"timestamp": "04:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And uh , she ends up getting the agenda requests uh , uh ten minutes before the meeting . But but But ."}
{"timestamp": "04:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But we can try ."}
{"timestamp": "04:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Maybe it 'll work ."}
{"timestamp": "04:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mmm ."}
{"timestamp": "04:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "04:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Weirder things have happened ."}
{"timestamp": "04:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , I mean ."}
{"timestamp": "04:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more ."}
{"timestamp": "04:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I would I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him ."}
{"timestamp": "04:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we 're done with that topic ."}
{"timestamp": "05:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The other topic I was thinking of was"}
{"timestamp": "05:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that ."}
{"timestamp": "05:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , actually I I was going to say we need to talk about that too ."}
{"timestamp": "05:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Why why don't we do that ."}
{"timestamp": "05:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK . Um , the new microphones , the two new ones are in ."}
{"timestamp": "05:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um . And they are being assembled as we speak , I hope ."}
{"timestamp": "05:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And I didn't bring my car today so I 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow ."}
{"timestamp": "05:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "well , a couple things . First of all ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them ."}
{"timestamp": "05:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh -"}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them ."}
{"timestamp": "05:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless ."}
{"timestamp": "05:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Another wireless setup . I mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired ."}
{"timestamp": "05:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So how many channels do you get to have"}
{"timestamp": "05:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "in a wireless setup ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "well ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I 'm pretty sure that you can daisy - chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless ."}
{"timestamp": "06:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So we currently have one base station with six wireless mike ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you can chain those together ."}
{"timestamp": "06:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes ."}
{"timestamp": "06:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , um ."}
{"timestamp": "06:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , you know it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six ."}
{"timestamp": "06:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ? So we could have up to nine ."}
{"timestamp": "06:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And right now we can have up to six ."}
{"timestamp": "06:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "06:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And we have five , we 're getting one more ."}
{"timestamp": "06:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And it 's um , about nine hundred dollars for the base station ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and then eight hundred per channel ."}
{"timestamp": "06:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars ."}
{"timestamp": "06:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "06:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh , we should do it ."}
{"timestamp": "06:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "06:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK , so I 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and and then just go ahead and order them ."}
{"timestamp": "06:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So we 're not increasing the number of channels ."}
{"timestamp": "07:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK . OK . I see ."}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "along with a couple of the wired that aren't working ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "one of the wired that 's not working ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "with a wireless ."}
{"timestamp": "07:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Three wireds work , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I I guess three wireds work , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . But we 've had more problems with that ."}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that ."}
{"timestamp": "07:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And so"}
{"timestamp": "07:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes , as long as we 're conscious about the batteries ."}
{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That seems to be the key"}
{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Everyone 's battery OK ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "issue ."}
{"timestamp": "07:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "07:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf ."}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well we should talk to them about it because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that ."}
{"timestamp": "08:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "SRI , really ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "08:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "They got sa apparent"}
{"timestamp": "08:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Maybe this needs to be bleeped out ? I have no clue ."}
{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh , I don't know . Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff ."}
{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I don't know how much of it 's public ."}
{"timestamp": "08:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "08:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW . So ."}
{"timestamp": "08:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony , uh , radio - mikes ."}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "08:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "which means some hand - soldering or something , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , no , we 're having the them do it . So it 's so hand - soldering it , but I 'm not doing it ."}
{"timestamp": "08:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , they they charge right ."}
{"timestamp": "08:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You 've never seen my hand - soldering ."}
{"timestamp": "08:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK , so that 's being done professionally and Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "a as I said they 're coming in ."}
{"timestamp": "08:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I I mean Yeah . I mean ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "As professionally as I guess you can get it done ."}
{"timestamp": "09:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean i it 's just their repair shop ."}
{"timestamp": "09:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ? Their maintenance people ."}
{"timestamp": "09:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , we 'll see what it it 's like . That tha that can be quite good ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "09:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Th - this Yeah , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "09:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Good . Yeah . So let 's go with that . Uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And , I mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like ."}
{"timestamp": "09:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "09:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Dave isn't here but he was going to"}

{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Has that started , or is that ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh , it would be to use his interface and I was going to meet with him today about that ."}
{"timestamp": "09:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , so , the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork . So I did the all that last week ."}
{"timestamp": "09:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So all the all the forms are now on the computer ."}
{"timestamp": "10:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And uh , then I have a bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and"}
{"timestamp": "10:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "let the uh transcribers use different tools . And I just want to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those ."}
{"timestamp": "10:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "it w it will be efficient for them to do that ."}
{"timestamp": "10:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I I don't think it 'll take too long ."}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , you know , just uh , a matter of a few days I suspect ."}
{"timestamp": "10:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user"}
{"timestamp": "10:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave ."}
{"timestamp": "10:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I 've already done five or six sets ."}

{"timestamp": "10:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You know , and I also have a bunch of scripts that will , like , generate P - files and run recognition on them also ."}
{"timestamp": "10:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}

{"timestamp": "36:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand , right ?"}

{"timestamp": "37:05", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation ."}
{"timestamp": "37:10", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy ,"}

{"timestamp": "37:23", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . Yeah . Um , and"}

{"timestamp": "37:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "37:30", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could you could do the dumbest thing"}
{"timestamp": "37:34", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and get get it ninety percent of the time . But when you"}
{"timestamp": "37:37", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features"}
{"timestamp": "37:42", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "is gonna give you the you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first ."}
{"timestamp": "37:46", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say \"\" OK this , i you know , it 's it 's really here \"\" ."}
{"timestamp": "37:51", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "What I mean is get it from the close - talking mikes ."}
{"timestamp": "37:56", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh , yeah . We t we t w"}
{"timestamp": "37:58", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "we t we talked about that ."}
{"timestamp": "38:03", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,"}
{"timestamp": "38:11", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,"}
{"timestamp": "38:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "38:15", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better ,"}

{"timestamp": "38:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time ."}
{"timestamp": "38:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , that 's what I wonder , because um or how bad it is , be um , because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "38:33", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Well -"}
{"timestamp": "38:45", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?"}
{"timestamp": "39:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Right , we discussed that ."}
{"timestamp": "39:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "39:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK , I 'm sorry I missed the @ @"}
{"timestamp": "39:09", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "It 's OK ."}
{"timestamp": "39:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume ,"}
{"timestamp": "39:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "39:14", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , by hand . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs ."}
{"timestamp": "39:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And , it seems to work , I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters ,"}
{"timestamp": "39:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "to get it to actually generate something ,"}
{"timestamp": "39:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and I haven't I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into Transcriber ."}
{"timestamp": "39:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so I told I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day , so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with ."}

{"timestamp": "39:45", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,"}

{"timestamp": "40:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up"}

{"timestamp": "40:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , and I haven't tried using that . It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that ."}

{"timestamp": "40:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I I haven't tried that , but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little ."}

{"timestamp": "40:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Exactly ."}
{"timestamp": "40:55", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "But but that 's a refinement and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first ."}

{"timestamp": "52:21", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise ."}
{"timestamp": "52:24", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "52:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "And then it was uh And then it would come on and it was very clear , you know ."}

{"timestamp": "53:16", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "There 's also um"}
{"timestamp": "53:17", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise ."}
{"timestamp": "53:23", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,"}
{"timestamp": "53:26", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos ."}

{"timestamp": "53:35", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at"}
{"timestamp": "53:43", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect ."}
{"timestamp": "53:46", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "And so , in a noisy situation ,"}
{"timestamp": "53:54", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical ."}
{"timestamp": "53:58", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So for those kind of reasons ,"}
{"timestamp": "54:00", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and also a a c a complete inversion , if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics ."}

{"timestamp": "54:20", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,"}
{"timestamp": "54:25", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know ,"}
{"timestamp": "54:41", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we we we sort of"}
{"timestamp": "54:47", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,"}
{"timestamp": "54:53", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh , just picking"}
{"timestamp": "55:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "uh will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do ."}
{"timestamp": "55:11", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was I was gonna"}
{"timestamp": "55:16", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "bring up . Uh ."}

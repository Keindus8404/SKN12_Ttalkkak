{"timestamp": "10:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "The other th the other experiment that they had in that paper was uh uh playing with the number of Gaussians per state ."}

{"timestamp": "11:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK . I should look at that more carefully cuz I wonder"}
{"timestamp": "11:06", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "what"}
{"timestamp": "11:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , OK . I was thinking it was Gaussians but it 's states . OK ."}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah , apparently ,"}
{"timestamp": "11:16", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "um they had better results when they increased the number of states ."}

{"timestamp": "11:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh make the silence model more powerful , you know , increasing the number of Gaussians to the number of states , different different things like that , so . That 's probably the next little thing I 'll play with when I get a chance"}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "11:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Why don't why don't we uh if there aren't any other major things , why don't we do the digits , and then then uh turn the mikes off ."}
{"timestamp": "12:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I 'll start ."}

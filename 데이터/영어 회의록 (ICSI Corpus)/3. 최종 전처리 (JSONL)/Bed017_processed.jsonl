{"timestamp": "06:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And what that would"}

{"timestamp": "07:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM , because , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "then you have one - user objects and potentially you can have many different sites"}
{"timestamp": "07:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "in in mind ."}

{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I guess you end up having"}
{"timestamp": "08:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "c well ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "it 's probably the same . But um ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "be able to"}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "re - use , like , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you can , you know , save some work on that ."}
{"timestamp": "08:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But ,"}

{"timestamp": "08:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , using the PRM will help ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "this this would be the class that"}
{"timestamp": "09:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "represent the intermediate nodes ."}
{"timestamp": "09:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And that would basically it 's just another class in the model ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "with , you know , references to the user and the site and"}
{"timestamp": "09:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the time ."}
{"timestamp": "09:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "of the queries would be"}
{"timestamp": "09:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "reduced to this . And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all ."}
{"timestamp": "09:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone"}
{"timestamp": "09:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "on the PRM stuff ."}
{"timestamp": "09:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}

{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so , instead of um ,"}
{"timestamp": "10:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites ."}

{"timestamp": "20:16", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "science , biology , and then But that 's really all that we have at the moment . So I think there 's a huge ,"}

{"timestamp": "20:36", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Um , so what I 'm what I try to do is um ,"}

{"timestamp": "21:08", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Now , what you"}
{"timestamp": "21:10", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information which is more elaborate than \"\" I 'm looking for this and this and this keyword . \"\" So ."}

{"timestamp": "22:10", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "And ,"}
{"timestamp": "22:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "are written in Java . So some some inferences like that , now ,"}
{"timestamp": "22:27", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "um , u using this you can infer more information , and you could then match this to the meta - data of um off the documents you 're you 're searching against ."}
{"timestamp": "22:41", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "given these inputs , and then I can compute how many documents match ,"}
{"timestamp": "22:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "and use this as a metric in the search ."}
{"timestamp": "22:53", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "uh try to improve the quality of the search results , and I want to do this by having a depth uh , um , um steepest descent approach ."}

{"timestamp": "23:27", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly , that that works in the small domain , but the problem is obviously the scalability ."}

{"timestamp": "24:16", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "What I 'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure , so it 's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic"}

{"timestamp": "24:52", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "uh you can get very different results . So it might ma make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines ."}

{"timestamp": "04:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It 's not quite better ."}
{"timestamp": "04:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right , but it seemed to me that what you were"}
{"timestamp": "04:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original FFT and with the filter which is what and the variance was one take uh on it ."}
{"timestamp": "04:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I used this too ."}

{"timestamp": "04:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "04:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So just having the three output thing doesn't doesn't really buy you anything ."}
{"timestamp": "04:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The issue is what you feed it ."}
{"timestamp": "05:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I have yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So uh"}
{"timestamp": "05:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "w"}
{"timestamp": "05:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "W well that 's another way . That wasn't what I was saying but yeah that 's certainly another thing to do . No I was just trying to say if you b if you"}
{"timestamp": "05:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mmm ."}
{"timestamp": "05:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And what I was saying is that the only thing I think that it buys you is um"}
{"timestamp": "05:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "based on whether you feed it something different ."}
{"timestamp": "05:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And something different in some fundamental way . And so the kind of thing that that she was talking about before ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "something"}
{"timestamp": "05:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh about the difference between the the uh um"}

{"timestamp": "06:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And so the filter bank"}
{"timestamp": "06:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effects of pitch and she 's saying you know trying So the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this m of this difference ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "but that might not be the right number ."}
{"timestamp": "06:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ? I mean maybe there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough or maybe there 's something else that that one could use , but"}
{"timestamp": "06:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think that , for me , the thing that that struck me was that uh you wanna get something back here , so here 's here 's an idea ."}
{"timestamp": "06:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh What about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ah I 'm sorry ."}
{"timestamp": "06:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "This is f"}
{"timestamp": "06:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You have the log magnitude spectrum ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and you were looking at that"}

{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That 's a clever thing to do . What if you stopped being clever ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And you just took this thing in here because it 's a neural net and neural nets are wonderful and"}
{"timestamp": "07:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "figure out what they can what they most need from things , and"}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean that 's what they 're good at ."}
{"timestamp": "07:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I mean you 're you 're you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should we should get about this difference but uh in fact ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "or feeding both of them in"}
{"timestamp": "07:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , another way , saying let it figure out what 's the what is the"}
{"timestamp": "07:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "interaction , especially if you do this over multiple frames ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then you have this over time ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and and both kinds of measures and uh you might get uh something better ."}

{"timestamp": "07:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean , it seems to me , if you have exactly the right thing then it 's better to do it without the net because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this you know , say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication ."}

{"timestamp": "19:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Actually , let me Hold that thought . Let me back up while we 're still on it . The the other thing I was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features ,"}

{"timestamp": "19:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK , sure ."}

{"timestamp": "20:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh"}
{"timestamp": "20:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um"}
{"timestamp": "20:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , if uh uh the example I was giving was that if if you had um"}
{"timestamp": "21:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "onset of voicing and and end of voicing as being two kinds of events ,"}

{"timestamp": "50:36", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "50:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and and uh you have something like forty - one percent error"}
{"timestamp": "50:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh and then you transform it to eight by doing doing this this work ."}
{"timestamp": "50:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So here 's this other system , which is a lot better ,"}
{"timestamp": "50:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "with the the distant mike , and one percent with the close mike ."}
{"timestamp": "50:55", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "50:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So the question is"}
{"timestamp": "50:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "how close to that one can you get"}
{"timestamp": "50:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "if you transform the data using that system ."}
{"timestamp": "51:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "r Right , so so I guess this SRI system is trained on a lot of s Broadcast News or Switchboard data ."}
{"timestamp": "51:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "51:08", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Is that right ? Do you know which one it is ?"}

{"timestamp": "51:15", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "51:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "um"}
{"timestamp": "51:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "a bunch of different sources , some digits , there 's some digits training in there ."}
{"timestamp": "51:19", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "51:20", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "O one thing I 'm wondering about is what this mean subtraction method"}
{"timestamp": "51:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "51:24", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "um will do if it 's faced with additive noise ."}
{"timestamp": "51:27", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Cuz I I it 's cuz I don't know what log magnitude spectral subtraction is gonna do"}
{"timestamp": "51:32", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "to additive noise ."}
{"timestamp": "51:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , well , it 's it 's not exactly the right thing but"}
{"timestamp": "51:35", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "51:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "but you 've already seen that cuz there is added noise here ."}
{"timestamp": "51:40", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "That 's that 's Yeah , that 's true ."}
{"timestamp": "51:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "51:43", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "That 's a good point ."}
{"timestamp": "51:49", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "it 's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the SRI system and"}
{"timestamp": "51:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I mean , as helpful I mean ,"}
{"timestamp": "51:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "so that 's the question ."}
{"timestamp": "51:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , w we 're often asked this when we work with a system that that isn't isn't sort of industry industry standard great ,"}
{"timestamp": "52:02", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "52:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "on a on a good system ."}
{"timestamp": "52:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So"}
{"timestamp": "52:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , this other one 's it was a pretty good system . I think ,"}
{"timestamp": "52:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , one one percent"}
{"timestamp": "52:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "word error rate on digits is uh digit strings is not"}
{"timestamp": "52:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "but given that this is real"}
{"timestamp": "52:23", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "52:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well ."}
{"timestamp": "52:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And it wasn't trained on this task either ."}
{"timestamp": "52:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , sort of in a reasonable range . People would say \"\" yeah , I could I can imagine getting that \"\" ."}
{"timestamp": "52:31", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "52:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor ."}
{"timestamp": "52:38", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "52:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "a sixteen digit uh credit card number you 'll"}
{"timestamp": "52:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "basically get it wrong almost all the time ."}
{"timestamp": "52:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So . So . Uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "52:46", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "52:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um a significant reduction in the error for that would be great ."}
{"timestamp": "52:51", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Huh , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "52:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And and then , uh Yeah . So ."}

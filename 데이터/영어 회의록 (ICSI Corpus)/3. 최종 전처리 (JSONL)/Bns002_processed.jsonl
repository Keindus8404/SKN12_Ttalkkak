{"timestamp": "06:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And eh , finally ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "This latt later case can be , for example , the use in military systems ,"}

{"timestamp": "06:21", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Hmm ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:21", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "But you can also , I believe , uh to have an ad - hoc network , where one node is then connecting to the outer world ."}

{"timestamp": "06:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "would the option for me to to use less power"}
{"timestamp": "06:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That 's O K . That 's perfect , you know . This in this case , we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:47", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "06:48", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "from this network to connect to other networks ,"}

{"timestamp": "06:57", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , OK . Here you have several several uh , proposed , uh , scenarios for for used this networks . When"}
{"timestamp": "07:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "no network is available , OK ? And another another application ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "for example , NASA is is uh studying , is uh the use of these networks , these ad - hoc networks , for sending multiple probes , uh , um uh missions ."}
{"timestamp": "07:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , for example , all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas , the last successful uh Mars mission , the cellular vehicle was only one ,"}

{"timestamp": "08:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "higher area could be covered , could be explored"}

{"timestamp": "08:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and uh of course , all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad - hoc networking , , ad - hoc routing ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:17", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:20", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "it 's , in principle , then the same ."}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . That 's O K ."}

{"timestamp": "08:22", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , these are more or less uh some"}

{"timestamp": "08:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And in the other case ,"}

{"timestamp": "08:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and we can uh"}
{"timestamp": "08:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "take some information"}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , for example for for fire - fighting ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we can just launch from a plane , several small sensors ,"}

{"timestamp": "45:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but again again , what we are"}
{"timestamp": "45:47", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "45:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh a little bit more , probably some some"}

{"timestamp": "46:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "eh even if nodes are completely static , eh some problems will happen in the wireless transmission , so"}

{"timestamp": "46:38", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Nee . That 's really right , but what I would like to say is that besides the RTS CTS behavior , you need certain kind of additional"}

{"timestamp": "47:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "an eh acknowledge from the receiver ,"}
{"timestamp": "47:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so you you are getting some kind of link layer uh acknowledgement scheme"}
{"timestamp": "47:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "which can save a lot of data transmissions because eh"}
{"timestamp": "47:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS ,"}
{"timestamp": "47:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "well , this takes longer than just a link layer"}
{"timestamp": "47:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , extra packet ."}
{"timestamp": "47:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That , of course"}
{"timestamp": "47:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh is also contemplated in this eh"}

{"timestamp": "49:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "well , uh you know"}
{"timestamp": "49:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "finally this algorithm , eh , as I was telling ,"}
{"timestamp": "49:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "eh what it 's doing is to check with the receiver"}
{"timestamp": "49:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And it is very simple to see that"}
{"timestamp": "49:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "some advantage can be obtained , because"}

{"timestamp": "51:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK . It won't be"}
{"timestamp": "51:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , I think that the answer to your question is"}
{"timestamp": "52:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But , it is a problem because you are using more area"}
{"timestamp": "52:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place"}

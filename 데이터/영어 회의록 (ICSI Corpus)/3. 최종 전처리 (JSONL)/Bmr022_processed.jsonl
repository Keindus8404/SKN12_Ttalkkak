{"timestamp": "01:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "01:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "because the whole thing gets"}

{"timestamp": "05:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Cuz if a beep is treated as a"}

{"timestamp": "44:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "44:50", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "that we can control with , you know , who can check things in and stuff . So we can I think we can do this ."}

{"timestamp": "44:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "44:57", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "45:01", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies ."}
{"timestamp": "45:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "45:06", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "And it won't affect the the g the global , official , ones at all ."}
{"timestamp": "45:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "45:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right , but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora ."}

{"timestamp": "45:13", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "45:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in , they 'll check it out once ,"}

{"timestamp": "45:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "they 'll make all the changes , they 'll never tell us about the changes ,"}
{"timestamp": "45:21", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "45:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and we 'll get two different corpora ."}

{"timestamp": "45:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "45:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think we 're already gonna I mean there 's already"}
{"timestamp": "45:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "some chance that different annotations , different"}
{"timestamp": "45:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But you can"}
{"timestamp": "45:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "control that by knowing you 're making two corpora or knowing that you 're adding"}

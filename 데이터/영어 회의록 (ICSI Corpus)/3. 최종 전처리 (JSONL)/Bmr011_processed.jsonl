{"timestamp": "06:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath ."}
{"timestamp": "06:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes ."}

{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "OK , we 're done ."}
{"timestamp": "06:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So we might as well get it as uniform as we can ."}

{"timestamp": "07:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That 's OK ."}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "but , uh , yeah , for future ones we can get it a bit more uniform ."}
{"timestamp": "07:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Great , great ."}
{"timestamp": "07:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I think just do a field trip at some point ."}

{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "07:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible ."}
{"timestamp": "07:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "07:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Great , thank you very much . It 's makes our job a lot easier ."}

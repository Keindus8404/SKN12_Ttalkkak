{"timestamp": "05:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No it isn't . Because the other thing you can do is you So this in this case , a mixture of experts just picks one ."}
{"timestamp": "05:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "to which decisions"}
{"timestamp": "05:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and actually I had"}
{"timestamp": "05:18", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "05:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right , so you can have a mixture that"}
{"timestamp": "05:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "A weighted one . So what you can do , if you if you need it is to say that I mean here there 's a fourth parameter . There 's a fifth parameter ."}

{"timestamp": "05:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The database ones being"}
{"timestamp": "05:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ? which is the H parameter ."}
{"timestamp": "05:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done"}
{"timestamp": "05:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So let 's suppose the H says in situ @ @ different uh , alpha ."}
{"timestamp": "05:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and so to do that"}
{"timestamp": "05:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK , in situation - alpha , that 's the weighting factor , but in situation - beta , it 's some other weighting factor ."}
{"timestamp": "05:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things"}

{"timestamp": "05:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}

{"timestamp": "06:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "do what we what we need to do . Once"}

{"timestamp": "20:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh this endpoint thing , the notion was"}
{"timestamp": "20:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So"}
{"timestamp": "20:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark"}

{"timestamp": "54:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "what rule of combination"}
{"timestamp": "54:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "is used there ."}

{"timestamp": "54:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm - hmm . Right ."}
{"timestamp": "54:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And belief - nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that ."}

{"timestamp": "54:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "54:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this ?"}
{"timestamp": "54:48", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "R basically"}

{"timestamp": "55:18", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "55:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and everything else fades and you just see"}

{"timestamp": "55:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And I does anybody remember"}
{"timestamp": "55:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the GUI on this ?"}
{"timestamp": "55:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make"}

{"timestamp": "55:47", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah I have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then"}
{"timestamp": "55:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "55:53", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "li consider that it 's respective , but"}

{"timestamp": "55:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the well the b"}
{"timestamp": "55:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "anyway"}
{"timestamp": "55:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so uh it clear"}
{"timestamp": "55:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram ."}
{"timestamp": "56:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "56:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Alright , so"}
{"timestamp": "56:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "e we have to figure out some eh eh"}
{"timestamp": "56:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh"}
{"timestamp": "56:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "basically display hack or something to do this because"}
{"timestamp": "56:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "anyway"}
{"timestamp": "56:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I I let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations"}

{"timestamp": "56:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "A , and B"}
{"timestamp": "56:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but"}

{"timestamp": "56:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "something like that ."}
{"timestamp": "56:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "56:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I I mean , it might soon , if this is gonna be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start"}
{"timestamp": "56:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "modifying it for our purposes ."}
{"timestamp": "56:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "56:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , and"}
{"timestamp": "56:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but"}

{"timestamp": "56:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we have to know what we want first ."}
{"timestamp": "57:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK , so why don't you tell us a little bit about"}

{"timestamp": "57:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these ?"}
{"timestamp": "57:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , it 's"}
{"timestamp": "57:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "right , I guess I can do that ."}
{"timestamp": "57:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Darn ."}
{"timestamp": "57:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Put it in your , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "57:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess this board works fine ."}
{"timestamp": "57:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So um recall the basic problem which is that um"}
{"timestamp": "57:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you have a belief - net and you have like"}
{"timestamp": "57:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "a lot of different nodes"}
{"timestamp": "58:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "all contributing to one node ."}
{"timestamp": "58:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "58:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So as we discussed"}
{"timestamp": "58:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "specifying this kind of thing"}
{"timestamp": "58:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because"}

{"timestamp": "58:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "a lot of numbers to write down ."}
{"timestamp": "58:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So what um helps us in our situation is that"}
{"timestamp": "58:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "these all"}
{"timestamp": "58:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "have values in the same set , right ? These are all like"}
{"timestamp": "58:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like"}
{"timestamp": "58:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean"}
{"timestamp": "58:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "basically we wanna just take a combination of we wanna view each of these as experts"}

{"timestamp": "58:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "each of them is making a decision based on some factors"}
{"timestamp": "58:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and we wanna sort of combine their decisions"}
{"timestamp": "58:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and create"}
{"timestamp": "58:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you know , um"}
{"timestamp": "58:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "sorta weighted"}

{"timestamp": "59:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So"}
{"timestamp": "59:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the problem is to specify the uh"}

{"timestamp": "59:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "59:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So um"}

{"timestamp": "59:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "XN , right ."}
{"timestamp": "59:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example"}

{"timestamp": "59:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "given that these guys are"}
{"timestamp": "59:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I 'll just refer to this as like X um"}

{"timestamp": "59:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep ."}

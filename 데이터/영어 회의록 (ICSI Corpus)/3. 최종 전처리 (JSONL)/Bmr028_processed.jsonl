{"timestamp": "02:17", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "02:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So what I did is I just took the file with those in it , converted it so that it looks like an audio file ."}
{"timestamp": "02:24", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "02:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And , so you s it shows that instead of the wavefile ."}
{"timestamp": "02:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so that that 's working , and I think it actually looks pretty good ."}

{"timestamp": "02:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ? Or ?"}
{"timestamp": "02:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No . I the"}
{"timestamp": "02:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "audio file you can specify any sampling rate ."}
{"timestamp": "02:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so I s I specified instead of ,"}

{"timestamp": "02:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "02:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and , the only problem with that is that there 's a bug in"}

{"timestamp": "03:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um , and crashes ."}
{"timestamp": "03:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But the solution to that is just ,"}
{"timestamp": "03:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file ,"}
{"timestamp": "03:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and it will work and the only problem with that is you can't ,"}
{"timestamp": "03:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh , zoom out on it . You can zoom in , but not out ."}
{"timestamp": "03:20", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "What 's a shape file ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "The shape file is If you think about a wavefile , sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen ."}
{"timestamp": "03:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "03:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So what Transcriber does , is it computes a another thing to display based on the"}
{"timestamp": "03:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And it allows you to show m many different resolutions . So there 's a little"}
{"timestamp": "03:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "user interface component that lets you sh select the resolution ."}
{"timestamp": "03:42", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I see ."}
{"timestamp": "03:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And if you don't compute the wavefile , you can't"}
{"timestamp": "03:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "zoom"}

{"timestamp": "03:51", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "03:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And that 's alright , because at at a hundred samples that 's already pretty far out ."}
{"timestamp": "03:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And , uh so I think it looks pretty good , but I 'll let Liz look at it and see what she thinks ."}
{"timestamp": "04:00", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "04:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sorry . I got the wavefile , but I couldn't get the words yet . But the the wavefile part looks looks good ."}

{"timestamp": "04:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Darn !"}
{"timestamp": "04:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I Does it really need to go in her ear ? That that bud ? It doesn't have to go in her ear . Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "04:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh , no . It doesn't have to , but that that 's I find that 's the only way to wear it ."}
{"timestamp": "04:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , wow ."}
{"timestamp": "04:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Is that the bud 's in the ear and that the link is over it ."}
{"timestamp": "04:50", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "This bud 's for No ."}
{"timestamp": "04:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And that actually shouldn't be too slow ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh , because it 's much lower resolution than a full waveform ."}
{"timestamp": "05:02", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "The problem with it is just it does require coding ."}
{"timestamp": "05:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . It migh"}
{"timestamp": "05:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so it would be much better to get ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh , Dave Gelbart to do that than me , because he 's familiar with the code ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly ."}
{"timestamp": "05:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It 'd be nice if we can do , like , a quick hack , just so we can play the audio file , too ."}

{"timestamp": "05:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "05:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it might be better to , rather , play the waveform than display it ."}
{"timestamp": "05:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean , like , if we were to choose I don't know , if I were to choose between one or the other , I 'd rather have it played ."}

{"timestamp": "05:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I understand what you mean ."}

{"timestamp": "06:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "06:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:32", "speaker": "Speaker_H", "text": "No . Whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript . Right ."}

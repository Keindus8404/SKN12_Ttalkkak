{"timestamp": "04:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um ."}
{"timestamp": "04:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "software that these guys created was certainly a a key part ."}
{"timestamp": "04:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So then there 's something central and there aren't at least"}

{"timestamp": "04:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That 's that 's nice ."}
{"timestamp": "04:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now ,"}
{"timestamp": "04:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "to run it , uh , a particular way ,"}
{"timestamp": "04:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and decide on what things"}
{"timestamp": "05:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything ."}
{"timestamp": "05:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So keep a certain set of things constant ."}
{"timestamp": "05:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , um ."}
{"timestamp": "05:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "what we are keeping constant for now , or ?"}

{"timestamp": "05:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well ."}
{"timestamp": "05:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "on the noise compensation and"}

{"timestamp": "05:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "05:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Are you gonna use which of the two techniques ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So finally it 's it 's , um , Wiener filtering"}

{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And it uses , uh , two steps ,"}

{"timestamp": "05:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the first step ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "that 's along time ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "which use recursion ."}

{"timestamp": "05:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "after this step"}
{"timestamp": "05:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "there is a further smoothing along frequency ,"}

{"timestamp": "06:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "This this smoothing is done on the estimate ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , of what you 're going to subtract ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "it 's on the transfer function ."}
{"timestamp": "06:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter ."}
{"timestamp": "06:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "06:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , so basically we tried"}
{"timestamp": "06:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "We tried u u applying this on mel bands , having spectral subtraction instead of wiener filtering . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "06:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Actually , let me int eh ,"}

{"timestamp": "07:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "is somewhat independent from the rest of it . I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "07:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , but you could ."}
{"timestamp": "07:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well well , we do , but we don't don't re - synthesize . In in the program we don't re - synthesize and then re - analyze once again . We just"}
{"timestamp": "07:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "use the clean FFT bins ."}
{"timestamp": "07:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here ."}
{"timestamp": "07:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "This is an option that then you can Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding"}
{"timestamp": "07:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "for an artificial situation ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well ."}
{"timestamp": "07:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But for the real situation"}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise . And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well ."}
{"timestamp": "08:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise"}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at ."}
{"timestamp": "08:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And , uh , generate new files or whatever ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and and , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh and then do the reverberation part ."}
{"timestamp": "08:20", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mmm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Anyway ."}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So Dave hasn't tried that yet ?"}

{"timestamp": "08:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we are not with the real case that we 're looking at ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we can't just look at reverberation in isolation because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable ."}
{"timestamp": "08:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And that 's"}
{"timestamp": "08:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and this is hard enough ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the interaction between channel effects"}
{"timestamp": "08:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects ."}
{"timestamp": "08:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And that 's hard enough . I mean , I don't think we really I mean , we 're trying to deal with that ."}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task ."}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects ."}
{"timestamp": "09:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And we have the"}
{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "noise suppression that 's doing something about noise ."}
{"timestamp": "09:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , even that 's hard enough . And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category ."}
{"timestamp": "09:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "i i"}
{"timestamp": "09:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work"}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so hard on on juggling everything around ."}
{"timestamp": "09:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects ."}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And , um , so"}
{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Dave has something which ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects but when it 's when there 's noise there too ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh , where you have the microphone distant ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "is going to have both things ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "we we actually have to think about both at the same time ."}
{"timestamp": "10:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out and then ,"}
{"timestamp": "10:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , well , the , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "10:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the form we have ."}
{"timestamp": "10:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the blocks that were already present before and that"}
{"timestamp": "10:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "we did not modify a lot ."}
{"timestamp": "10:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed"}
{"timestamp": "10:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , that 's done at the FFT level ."}

{"timestamp": "18:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But I I w w"}

{"timestamp": "18:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "try it ."}

{"timestamp": "44:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "44:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you know and and , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves ."}

{"timestamp": "45:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the way I 've been looking at it . That it 's it 's it 's all not very clear to me . But"}

{"timestamp": "45:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "45:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and so"}
{"timestamp": "45:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess what I don't understand is how to do that"}

{"timestamp": "45:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh ,"}

{"timestamp": "46:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ? Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward"}

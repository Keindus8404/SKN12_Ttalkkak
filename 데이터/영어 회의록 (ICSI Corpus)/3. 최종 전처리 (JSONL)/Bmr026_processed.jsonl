{"timestamp": "38:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Gender - dependent , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:47", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "mmm , something like thirty hours ."}

{"timestamp": "39:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right . So At least a couple thousand hidden units ."}

{"timestamp": "39:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect ."}
{"timestamp": "39:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger ."}
{"timestamp": "39:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:54", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course . Yeah . It 's negligible , OK ."}
{"timestamp": "39:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference ."}

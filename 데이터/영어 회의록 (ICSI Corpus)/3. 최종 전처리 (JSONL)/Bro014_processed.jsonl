{"timestamp": "29:26", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "of the excitation , something like this ,"}

{"timestamp": "30:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So it 's it 's not really an excitation , but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation ."}
{"timestamp": "30:04", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "30:18", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah . So , well , for unvoiced portion we have something tha"}

{"timestamp": "30:31", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "But the variance seem quite high . So Mmm ."}
{"timestamp": "30:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . We , uh , use TIMIT on this ,"}

{"timestamp": "31:34", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "And , uh Yeah . Hopefully , I think"}
{"timestamp": "31:39", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "what we want to have is to put these features in s some kind of ,"}
{"timestamp": "31:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "um well , to to obtain a statistical model on these features and to or just to use a neural network"}
{"timestamp": "31:58", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "32:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "that seemed pretty encouraging . Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "32:03", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Except the variance is quite high . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , y I I don't know that I would trust that so much because you 're doing these canonical mappings from TIMIT labellings . Right ? So ,"}
{"timestamp": "32:08", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "32:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "really that 's sort of a cartoon picture about what 's voiced and unvoiced . So that could be giving you a lot of variance ."}
{"timestamp": "32:16", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "i it it may be that that you 're finding something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you 're getting your truth ."}
{"timestamp": "32:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "32:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So another way of looking at it is that"}

{"timestamp": "32:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "By going back to the FFT ,"}

{"timestamp": "33:40", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "well , using the th the FFT ,"}
{"timestamp": "33:44", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean . But So ,"}
{"timestamp": "33:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:54", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "this is why we we started to look by having"}

{"timestamp": "34:04", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "34:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,"}
{"timestamp": "34:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced , both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then ,"}
{"timestamp": "34:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said , that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect ."}

{"timestamp": "35:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Or , what 's the use of the the voiced - unvoiced detector ?"}

{"timestamp": "35:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "35:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh , no . No . No , the idea was , I guess , to to use them as as features ."}

{"timestamp": "35:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Features . I see ."}
{"timestamp": "35:54", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah , it could be , uh it could be a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection ,"}
{"timestamp": "36:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:01", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "but it could be in the also the big neural network that does phoneme classification ."}

{"timestamp": "21:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And also I just wanted to mention briefly that , um ,"}

{"timestamp": "21:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "see how well it can do"}

{"timestamp": "21:53", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking"}

{"timestamp": "22:02", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "where they 're speaking based on"}

{"timestamp": "22:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So ."}
{"timestamp": "22:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well that 's with the hand stuff ."}
{"timestamp": "22:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But how would you do that automatically ?"}

{"timestamp": "22:21", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "22:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do . So ."}
{"timestamp": "22:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "So why do you want to do echo cancellation ?"}
{"timestamp": "22:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation which I don't know enough about to talk about . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "22:33", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "22:33", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "It just it just to r to remove cross - talk . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But , right , um , and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do , but using"}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , you know , more than energy I I don't know"}
{"timestamp": "22:44", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "what exactly would go into it . So the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "22:45", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Yeah , sure ."}
{"timestamp": "22:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries"}
{"timestamp": "22:52", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "OK . So do sort of what he 's already what he 's trying to do ."}
{"timestamp": "22:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "of the individual speak"}
{"timestamp": "22:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right . Except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues , um , that you can use to do that ."}
{"timestamp": "22:56", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "OK , I s I see ."}
{"timestamp": "22:56", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Yeah , in another way , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "22:58", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:02", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "I see ."}

{"timestamp": "23:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And I guess Espen ? This is uh is he here too ? May also be working So it would just be ver that 's really the next step because we can't"}
{"timestamp": "23:14", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "do too much , you know , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem"}
{"timestamp": "23:24", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , until we can do that kind of processing ."}
{"timestamp": "23:29", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "23:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "some of yours , and @ @ we 'll move on ."}

{"timestamp": "23:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}

{"timestamp": "24:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Not names , but"}
{"timestamp": "24:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep . Yeah , names names in the names to I Ds , so you"}

{"timestamp": "24:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Great ."}

{"timestamp": "25:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Probably , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "25:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh I see . OK . Alright , I did know that ."}
{"timestamp": "25:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um , so the the only question is how much of it The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not ."}
{"timestamp": "25:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "25:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate ."}
{"timestamp": "25:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "25:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So ,"}
{"timestamp": "25:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal because disks don't crash very frequently , as long as you can regenerate it ."}
{"timestamp": "25:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Then put it all on scratch because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup ."}

{"timestamp": "26:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK . So , I mean , I guess th the other question was then ,"}
{"timestamp": "26:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It just depends on your tools ."}
{"timestamp": "26:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded ,"}
{"timestamp": "26:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything ."}
{"timestamp": "26:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "26:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We can downsample them ,"}

{"timestamp": "26:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "OK ."}

{"timestamp": "05:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um , it 's it 's gonna b it 's for reasons because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there . There 's more equipment in there ."}
{"timestamp": "05:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But there 's the idea is that there are these microphones on the table , there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and then that 's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there ."}
{"timestamp": "05:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors , so that so that it 's not open to fiddling ."}
{"timestamp": "05:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So that 's what 's gonna happen ."}
{"timestamp": "05:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "05:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That 's"}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that ?"}

{"timestamp": "05:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , I I can help them get done um one question is budget . Do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that ."}
{"timestamp": "05:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah !"}
{"timestamp": "05:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh I mean , I don't know . Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , how much are we talking about here ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "06:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I don't know . A cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars , two hundred dollars something like that ."}
{"timestamp": "06:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I mean , you know , we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it ."}
{"timestamp": "06:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean ."}
{"timestamp": "06:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean , I think um I 'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or"}
{"timestamp": "06:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you know ."}
{"timestamp": "06:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , I think our intention at this point is when we 're not using it to record a meeting we 'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on ."}
{"timestamp": "06:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So ."}
{"timestamp": "06:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But , well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible ."}
{"timestamp": "06:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , and there 's also the minor matter , it 'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say \"\" yes , this is where we do such - and - such \"\" ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and then be able to see uh ,"}

{"timestamp": "07:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So ."}
{"timestamp": "07:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean there 's one big issue with the equipment still ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "which is um"}
{"timestamp": "07:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "ultimately we 're gonna well the idea is to have"}
{"timestamp": "07:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "any number of these wired headsets , but"}
{"timestamp": "07:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "there 's this amplification problem ."}
{"timestamp": "07:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I built this thing , it 's that 's it 's very noisy . We 're actually recording I 'm I 'm going through it at the moment , but it 's so noisy that I am not using for this ."}

{"timestamp": "07:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But I 'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre - amp as an alternative ."}
{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , we should be able to just go buy some preamps , I would think ."}
{"timestamp": "07:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It 's just it eh"}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You see how clumsy this is right ? I have to use these batteries to bias them ."}
{"timestamp": "07:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "There are like three connectors in the circuit ."}
{"timestamp": "07:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The thing is , like ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it 's not s it 's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially , but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop ."}
{"timestamp": "07:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So it seemed like it was a good idea to make one ."}
{"timestamp": "08:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And I 'm still not sure . I mean , I think I probably know how to fix this . I can probably"}
{"timestamp": "08:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "build it better so it doesn't have such noise , but"}
{"timestamp": "08:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it 's kind of a buy ."}
{"timestamp": "08:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , ultimately we 're gonna need to build one anyway ."}
{"timestamp": "08:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Are we ?"}

{"timestamp": "19:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "19:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah so it might be four ."}

{"timestamp": "19:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff ."}

{"timestamp": "21:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , it 's OK , it 's only the first try . I what I 'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four , so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel ."}

{"timestamp": "27:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um"}

{"timestamp": "27:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And then we can"}
{"timestamp": "27:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , the the problem of course is that it 's you know , in in this meeting it 's three four five six seven eight , it 's nine transcripts , potentially ."}

{"timestamp": "27:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well ,"}
{"timestamp": "27:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually , right ? You would send I mean ,"}

{"timestamp": "28:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , that would be interesting ."}

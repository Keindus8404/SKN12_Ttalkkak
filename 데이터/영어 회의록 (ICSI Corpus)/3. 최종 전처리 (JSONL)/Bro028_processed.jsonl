{"timestamp": "05:13", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , the reason w why why we did that with the silence probability was that ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:23", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:24", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So there is the tandem network that e e e estimates the phone probabilities"}

{"timestamp": "05:51", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "maybe ,"}

{"timestamp": "09:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral"}

{"timestamp": "09:19", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "It was c it was just combined , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:22", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "by the acoustic model . So there was ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:25", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "no neural network for the moment . Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right . So , I mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there ,"}

{"timestamp": "09:33", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "09:35", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:41", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , and the other thing , that noise estimation and th um ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:49", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "tandem network , right now , is like i is using the noises from the Aurora task and"}
{"timestamp": "09:58", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "um ,"}
{"timestamp": "09:59", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "try to argue about that because"}
{"timestamp": "10:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So we have t n"}

{"timestamp": "10:21", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "10:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But it may be something else th at least you could say it was ."}
{"timestamp": "10:22", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And then if it doesn't hurt too much , though ."}

{"timestamp": "10:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . That 's a good idea ."}

{"timestamp": "11:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "There 's two problems there . I mean I mean , so so the first is"}
{"timestamp": "11:45", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "11:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "i i you 're you 're adding other degradation ."}

{"timestamp": "12:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "12:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and the second thing is which is"}

{"timestamp": "42:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different but ,"}
{"timestamp": "42:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that"}
{"timestamp": "42:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um ,"}
{"timestamp": "42:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints ."}

{"timestamp": "42:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And so in fact they 're multi - scale ."}
{"timestamp": "43:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . They use several of them . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "43:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "43:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , I mean , you don't have to but but but , uh , Hynek has ."}
{"timestamp": "43:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "43:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think he may have had people sometimes doing it on both simultaneously some two - D and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things ."}
{"timestamp": "43:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the feature selection thing , it 's a simple method ,"}
{"timestamp": "43:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis in which you which I think it 's used in social sciences a lot ."}
{"timestamp": "43:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , you you you you pick the best feature ."}
{"timestamp": "43:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it ."}
{"timestamp": "44:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And what what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right"}
{"timestamp": "44:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "set of features . Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it . So ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features ."}
{"timestamp": "44:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this"}
{"timestamp": "44:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "artificial question of of , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal , but it seems like a pretty good heuristic ."}
{"timestamp": "44:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff . And and and , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way ."}
{"timestamp": "44:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "44:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so so that , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "45:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and these different functions ,"}
{"timestamp": "45:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth ."}
{"timestamp": "45:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "45:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "45:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh , energy and fre and frequency . And some are emphasizing downward and"}
{"timestamp": "45:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "and so forth . So ."}
{"timestamp": "45:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at . But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what"}
{"timestamp": "45:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "branch out from there ."}
{"timestamp": "45:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And his advisor is"}
{"timestamp": "45:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "here , too , at the same time . So ,"}
{"timestamp": "46:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So ."}
{"timestamp": "46:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , like , if we have ,"}
{"timestamp": "46:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping ,"}

{"timestamp": "47:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "47:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all ,"}
{"timestamp": "47:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "because we are going into a a very powerful ,"}

{"timestamp": "48:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "you 've lost information and yet it does better"}
{"timestamp": "48:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered , then we would 've completely solved this problem long ago , because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms ."}
{"timestamp": "48:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "48:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh ,"}

{"timestamp": "49:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "49:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "so , uh , the big picture is k"}
{"timestamp": "49:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "um , come up with a set of ,"}

{"timestamp": "33:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I see ."}

{"timestamp": "34:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ?"}
{"timestamp": "34:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Thirty or forty ."}

{"timestamp": "34:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So it 's thirty dollars an hour , essentially , right ? But we can pay a graduate student"}

{"timestamp": "34:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate ."}

{"timestamp": "35:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time ."}
{"timestamp": "35:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And also we would have control"}

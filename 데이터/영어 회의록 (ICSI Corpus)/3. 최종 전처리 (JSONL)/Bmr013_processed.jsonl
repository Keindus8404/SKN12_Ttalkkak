{"timestamp": "05:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So it 's it 's just I have a file whi which has this information on it ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:43", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "05:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and then when you start using my scripts ,"}

{"timestamp": "05:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean , it 's easy to create the files and leave them blank , and so actually we could do it in either order ."}

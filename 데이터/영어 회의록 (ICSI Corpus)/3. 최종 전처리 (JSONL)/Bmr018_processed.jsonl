{"timestamp": "04:54", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Right ."}

{"timestamp": "05:34", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:35", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um ,"}

{"timestamp": "06:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I 'm just thinking that"}

{"timestamp": "06:13", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Oh , that 's right . So the first thing is the automatic thing ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "06:16", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up , and then it 's IBM ."}

{"timestamp": "06:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm - hmm , mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "06:21", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:26", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "and then , uh ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:28", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "you would give IBM whatever was"}
{"timestamp": "06:30", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "fixed ."}
{"timestamp": "06:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "06:34", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end , right ? So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM ."}
{"timestamp": "06:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "OK ."}
{"timestamp": "06:40", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Right ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:41", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "As of what point ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "I mean ."}
{"timestamp": "06:45", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "The I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM , or do we go ahead and send them a sample ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Why wouldn't we s @ @ w i if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't"}
{"timestamp": "06:59", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:02", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Well I I I mean , I don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "07:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That was the question ."}
{"timestamp": "07:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Though ."}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "So if we if we were ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:07", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:07", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing ."}
{"timestamp": "07:09", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Uh . That I agree . I agree ."}
{"timestamp": "07:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean , h"}
{"timestamp": "07:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "they they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm , I gue hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting ."}
{"timestamp": "07:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I would think , unless it 's a lot harder than we think it is , which it could be ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "certainly ."}
{"timestamp": "07:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "If it 's got like for speakers then"}

{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "We 're just doing the individual channels , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:35", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:39", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "um ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I guess there is this issue of , you know , if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch , on a particular channel , and there really was ,"}

{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "so , I mean , the question is \"\" should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it"}
{"timestamp": "08:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That 's what it seems to me too , in that"}
{"timestamp": "08:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And that cuts down the time ."}

{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "I don't see how that will work , though ."}
{"timestamp": "08:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "What what aspect ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:18", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So , they have the normal channeltrans"}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:25", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Should be pretty good , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Except for it doesn't do well on short things , remember . It will miss them . It will miss most of the really short things ."}
{"timestamp": "08:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh - huh ."}
{"timestamp": "08:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Like that ."}

{"timestamp": "08:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I 'll work on that ."}

{"timestamp": "08:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but presumably , most of those they"}

{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , and that 's what I 'm not sure about ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part ."}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I am too . And I think it 's an empirical question ."}
{"timestamp": "09:04", "speaker": "Speaker_F", "text": "Can't we uh couldn't we just have , um ,"}

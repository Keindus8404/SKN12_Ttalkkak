{"timestamp": "47:12", "speaker": "Speaker_G", "text": "Mm - hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "47:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So there are these decisions . And then"}
{"timestamp": "47:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "one half of this we talked about at little bit is"}
{"timestamp": "47:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "how if you had the right information , if you knew something about what was said and about th the something about"}

{"timestamp": "47:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Is it a castle , is it a bank ? Is it a s town square , is it a statue ?"}
{"timestamp": "47:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Whatever ."}
{"timestamp": "47:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So all that kind of information could be combined"}

{"timestamp": "48:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "he wants to take a picture ."}

{"timestamp": "48:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the idea that we 're really after"}

{"timestamp": "49:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , what we 're really trying to do"}

{"timestamp": "02:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour ."}
{"timestamp": "02:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . Um , so"}
{"timestamp": "03:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see ."}
{"timestamp": "03:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss ."}

{"timestamp": "03:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition .

{"timestamp": "04:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh-huh ."}
{"timestamp": "04:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board ."}
{"timestamp": "04:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "04:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice ."}
{"timestamp": "05:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised ."}
{"timestamp": "05:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?

{"timestamp": "06:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .

{"timestamp": "07:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget ."}

{"timestamp": "08:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that ."}
{"timestamp": "08:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button ."}
{"timestamp": "08:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it's uh actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money ."}
{"timestamp": "08:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think it's a good figure ."}
{"timestamp": "08:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh , okay . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?"}

{"timestamp": "09:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's not it doesn't say . We don't have the price up there , okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per"}

{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the L_C_D_ in , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration ."}

{"timestamp": "10:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down ."}

{"timestamp": "10:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "10:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding ."}

{"timestamp": "12:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one . No , no we g no , that's the same one . You have to go back and find another one ."}
{"timestamp": "12:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's no , I think it's the same one ."}
{"timestamp": "12:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Whatever name it popped up under ."}
{"timestamp": "12:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see ."}
{"timestamp": "12:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Functional ."}
{"timestamp": "12:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep , that's it . So we'll go screen by screen . Although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study ."}
{"timestamp": "12:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "S Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . Next screen ."}

{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No kidding , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mayb maybe they already expected something ."}
{"timestamp": "13:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers ."}
{"timestamp": "13:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "13:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . Okay ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "13:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production ."}
{"timestamp": "13:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . So , now we have to come up with a decision . Can the company sell two million units ? Can it sell it for fifty Euros ?"}

{"timestamp": "14:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Could could I go to findings ? Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . That way you have no storage , you have no um you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale . The point of sale is online ."}

{"timestamp": "14:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon , don't you think ? Or eBay , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "07:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Colour , size , sh"}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So you you think it's better if small"}
{"timestamp": "07:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "than bigger ."}
{"timestamp": "08:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , not too small , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like ."}

{"timestamp": "08:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , like a palm sized ."}

{"timestamp": "08:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame ."}
{"timestamp": "08:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place ."}

{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "08:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no ."}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , no screens , it's too complex ."}
{"timestamp": "09:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm . Too expensive , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . But no screens on remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "09:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And too expensive ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user ."}
{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like ."}
{"timestamp": "09:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Ye yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-mm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , for instance , mm ."}

{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So adaptable yeah something yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Adaptable . Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm huh ."}
{"timestamp": "09:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "On off ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working ."}
{"timestamp": "10:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations ."}
{"timestamp": "10:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a"}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Two ."}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Three buttons you mean ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Three option ."}

{"timestamp": "10:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "10:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm . If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may"}
{"timestamp": "10:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sh sure , sure ."}
{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time ."}
{"timestamp": "10:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else ."}
{"timestamp": "11:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five ."}
{"timestamp": "11:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm . You do this ?"}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I usually just change channels ."}
{"timestamp": "11:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Dash ."}
{"timestamp": "11:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was ."}
{"timestamp": "11:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool ."}
{"timestamp": "11:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh-huh . Go back button is good . I once had it ."}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah you can yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

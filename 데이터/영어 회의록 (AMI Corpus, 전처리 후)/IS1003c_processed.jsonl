{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object .

{"timestamp": "09:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe ."}
{"timestamp": "09:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you"}

{"timestamp": "09:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one ."}

{"timestamp": "09:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But you would still have the buttons . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . You can see they can switch form one modality to another ."}
{"timestamp": "10:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , so you yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "11:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think he need a control that is very reliable , so ."}
{"timestamp": "11:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "no one would would be interested ."}
{"timestamp": "11:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller ."}

{"timestamp": "11:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?

{"timestamp": "12:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "12:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No . No ."}
{"timestamp": "12:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Cause for example yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .

{"timestamp": "13:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And for all the person of the family maybe , so , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You don't need to tune it ."}
{"timestamp": "13:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller ."}
{"timestamp": "13:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google ."}

{"timestamp": "13:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller ."}
{"timestamp": "14:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use ."}

{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's the problem , yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so ."}

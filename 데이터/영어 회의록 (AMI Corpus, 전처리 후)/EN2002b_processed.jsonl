And then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built into Java , I mean to process X_M_L_ into like in just creates whatever file it's gonna be in . Uh it's been a f couple of years since I've looked into anything like this . But uh that might even be an easier way . And then that way we could even pre-process that before hand . I don't know , do well we don't wanna have to do that , right ? Although on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun ."}

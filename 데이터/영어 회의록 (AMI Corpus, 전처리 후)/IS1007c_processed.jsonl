{"timestamp": "02:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . But uh well"}

{"timestamp": "03:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .

{"timestamp": "03:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment ."}

The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . Yeah . Yeah . So ."}

{"timestamp": "09:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "09:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well ."}
{"timestamp": "09:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm"}
{"timestamp": "09:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "but this interface are kind of confusing ."}
{"timestamp": "09:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh basically there are too many buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "09:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right . Next one ."}
{"timestamp": "09:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So some people are propose voice recognition and"}
{"timestamp": "10:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that ,"}
{"timestamp": "10:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm mm mm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah fine ."}
{"timestamp": "10:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "supposedly . The next one ."}
{"timestamp": "10:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Next one ."}
{"timestamp": "11:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And some people propose a scroll button ."}

{"timestamp": "11:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , next one ."}
{"timestamp": "11:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So"}
{"timestamp": "11:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "mm"}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so there are a few aspects that I collected here ."}
{"timestamp": "11:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people ,"}
{"timestamp": "11:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "old people , and uh"}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh"}
{"timestamp": "11:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "mm yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect"}
{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point ."}
{"timestamp": "12:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The next one ."}
{"timestamp": "12:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover ."}
{"timestamp": "12:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "S a good idea ."}
{"timestamp": "12:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The next one . So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons . At I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . T_V_ remote controller where are you ? And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . Is it possible ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "13:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control ."}

{"timestamp": "13:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design ."}
{"timestamp": "14:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "14:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so ."}

{"timestamp": "15:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ ."}

{"timestamp": "15:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "A help button . So you are display on the screen . So on the T_V_ screen ."}

{"timestamp": "15:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "16:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . It's a psychology . Okay . And let us see what the market demands . We could just go to my presentation ."}

{"timestamp": "17:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Let's see the market demand ."}

So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .

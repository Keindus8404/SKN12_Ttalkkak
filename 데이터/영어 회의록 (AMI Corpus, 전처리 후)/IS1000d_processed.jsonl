{"timestamp": "25:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But as it is now , I w would say"}

{"timestamp": "33:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "thing ?"}
{"timestamp": "34:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it would need twelve buttons ."}

{"timestamp": "34:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So this comes to eighteen ."}
{"timestamp": "34:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . And that's without any special button supplements ."}
{"timestamp": "34:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need ."}

{"timestamp": "38:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty"}

{"timestamp": "35:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches ."}

{"timestamp": "35:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "35:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work ."}

{"timestamp": "36:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No uh uh ."}
{"timestamp": "36:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Maybe you should draw it very large like this ."}

{"timestamp": "37:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display ."}
{"timestamp": "37:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "37:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "38:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I is it if if this is from the side woah . Steady . Because there the screen goes up like that right ? So then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ?"}
{"timestamp": "38:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh from yeah yeah . Sorry ."}
{"timestamp": "39:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "39:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The the idea is that it has to flip up to here ."}
{"timestamp": "39:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble ."}
{"timestamp": "39:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "39:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because it do doesn't have to flip then ."}
{"timestamp": "39:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this ."}
{"timestamp": "39:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "True ."}
{"timestamp": "39:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism ."}
{"timestamp": "39:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Think so ."}
{"timestamp": "39:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah we keep the flip ?"}
{"timestamp": "39:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "39:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Keep the flip live ."}
{"timestamp": "40:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "40:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh the the shape is okay but yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "40:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "40:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button ."}
{"timestamp": "40:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? And then like i oh th doh ."}
{"timestamp": "40:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah and then h we sh mm ."}
{"timestamp": "40:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . So there's a layer of rubber on the side . So no flipping but just no ."}
{"timestamp": "40:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely ."}
{"timestamp": "40:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No flipping ?"}
{"timestamp": "41:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ?"}
{"timestamp": "41:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Throwing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually ."}
{"timestamp": "41:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's shaking ."}
{"timestamp": "41:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "41:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah true true ."}
{"timestamp": "41:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah just light on top ."}
{"timestamp": "41:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "41:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Safer ."}
{"timestamp": "41:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . Yeah okay that the target group ."}
{"timestamp": "41:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "41:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah okay . That's true ."}
{"timestamp": "41:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "41:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well . I just uh ended the meeting . You two go design ."}
{"timestamp": "41:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "41:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay wi"}
{"timestamp": "41:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "41:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote ."}
{"timestamp": "41:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "41:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh right ."}
{"timestamp": "41:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "41:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "41:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go ."}
{"timestamp": "41:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Good ."}
{"timestamp": "41:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So maybe you can include that somewhere ."}
{"timestamp": "41:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ?"}
{"timestamp": "42:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well ."}
{"timestamp": "42:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Let's see ."}
{"timestamp": "42:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "42:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "What the hell's that ?"}

{"timestamp": "42:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "42:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay that's the side ."}
{"timestamp": "42:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ?"}
{"timestamp": "42:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . I think we do ."}
{"timestamp": "42:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button ."}
{"timestamp": "42:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "42:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . No , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "42:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "42:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "42:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think ."}

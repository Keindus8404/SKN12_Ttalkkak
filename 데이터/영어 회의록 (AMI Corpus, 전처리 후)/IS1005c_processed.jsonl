Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria .

Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .

{"timestamp": "05:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Exactly ."}
{"timestamp": "07:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this ."}
{"timestamp": "08:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it ."}

Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . So at least seven to seven ."}

Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that .

{"timestamp": "17:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think ."}

{"timestamp": "19:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "19:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's it's quite innovative , yes ."}
{"timestamp": "19:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things ."}

{"timestamp": "19:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case .

For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen ."}

{"timestamp": "19:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "19:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier ."}

{"timestamp": "21:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , right . Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible ."}

{"timestamp": "29:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

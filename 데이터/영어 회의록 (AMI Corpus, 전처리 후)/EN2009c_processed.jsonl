{"timestamp": "39:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , but does um the duration of fixations count for anything ? 'Cause it if you're just adding the length of the blink to the fixation , you're not treating it as a saccade ."}

It's only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that um the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object , which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing .

{"timestamp": "41:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , it's not okay , I mean this is kinda what we were talking about before , this confusion about what's in the G_D_F_ . I mean you might see it as the initial G_D_F_ is just whatever straight-forwardly translates without , you know , without transforms , with just the data format changing from the ASCII . And then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in um augmented G_D_F_ format , you know , like this blink and the gaze and whatever else . And then you translate to N_X_T_ . So you might still wanna have everything in this one G_D_F_ file format that represents everything . And then the N_X_T_ thing is just a splitter . It's not doing any fancy analysis . So I see this as , you know , a bunch of little routines that take the the G_D_F_ without this information in it and add new information into th sub-script versions of the G_D_F_ file that contains these post-process analyses ."}

Yeah , the German stuff . Uh because that little utility um does things like t well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks , whether just to lump them in or or not . Uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be , sort of you have if it picks up t fixations less than say fifty milliseconds , you can tell it just to again lump them all together , that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation . Uh you can put in these sort of of things . So that's uh that's a bit of software that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well ."}

That you know , as part of the the and als Well why do I think this ?

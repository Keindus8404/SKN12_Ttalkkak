Are the rest of the y uh are is the rest of what you're to do with that software fairly clear ? 'Cause this is about the analysis . You really only need Robin , right , to to specify the rest ."}
{"timestamp": "29:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , yeah , so this yeah . Yes , yes . He'll he'll just be working with Robin on what analysis we need to get out of the G_D_F_ format . Um so I'm gonna c basically I've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ASCII to G_D_F_ converter . Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G_D_F_ output part to it . Um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video . Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X_M_L_ . So so that's that's what I'm gonna look at . And then once I've done that I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the G_D_F_ ."}

If you get that far , try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see . Um uh y Ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list , right . So so Yeah . So , but it'd be good to , you know , make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it . So um , you know , if we do talk about that , then it might be nice to have her along for it ."}

{"timestamp": "11:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?

{"timestamp": "11:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "12:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So it's frustrated me in the past , th that ."}
{"timestamp": "12:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this ."}
{"timestamp": "12:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like ."}
{"timestamp": "12:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah , okay . Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "13:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that"}
{"timestamp": "13:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume ."}

{"timestamp": "13:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah , n ."}
{"timestamp": "13:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream ."}
{"timestamp": "13:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and"}
{"timestamp": "13:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "you have a heart attack ."}
{"timestamp": "13:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "13:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah so you can Do you have something ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune ."}
{"timestamp": "14:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , that's true ."}

{"timestamp": "01:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple ."}

{"timestamp": "04:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "04:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed ."}
{"timestamp": "05:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "05:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And could it be adapted ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command ."}
{"timestamp": "05:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip"}

{"timestamp": "05:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "06:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it ."}

{"timestamp": "07:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "07:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "07:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder ."}

{"timestamp": "08:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "08:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .

{"timestamp": "08:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um . So ."}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage ."}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so ."}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle ."}

{"timestamp": "09:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? These are the basic thing ."}
{"timestamp": "09:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So it's only the central part ."}
{"timestamp": "09:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two ."}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part ."}
{"timestamp": "09:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have ."}
{"timestamp": "09:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "09:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way ."}
{"timestamp": "10:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . S"}
{"timestamp": "10:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Will be down or Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So that they're separate a bit , yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either ."}
{"timestamp": "10:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user ."}
{"timestamp": "10:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright , you won't yeah . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . Yeah . That you want to protect a bit ."}
{"timestamp": "10:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And I think it's uh it's reasonable ."}
{"timestamp": "10:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want ."}

{"timestamp": "10:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case ."}
{"timestamp": "11:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors ."}
{"timestamp": "11:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple ."}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect ."}

{"timestamp": "11:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that ."}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we can move to the Is there any question ? For"}

From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ?

{"timestamp": "12:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from ."}

{"timestamp": "17:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's very complex ."}
{"timestamp": "17:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not ."}

And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German .

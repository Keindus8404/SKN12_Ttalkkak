{"timestamp": "10:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh . Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c"}

{"timestamp": "10:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "05:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh it should okay , yeah . The user should know ."}

{"timestamp": "05:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . So ."}
{"timestamp": "05:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright ."}

So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside ."}

{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know"}

{"timestamp": "11:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?"}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , I don't think it will be too much ."}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . As it's yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "12:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know ."}
{"timestamp": "12:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some"}

{"timestamp": "12:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . This you will see in my presentation then ."}
{"timestamp": "13:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}

We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um ,"}
{"timestamp": "13:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "and see what was okay or not for them . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered ."}

{"timestamp": "13:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You mean the loo the look , the outside ? Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "14:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe ."}
{"timestamp": "14:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um"}
{"timestamp": "14:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh"}

{"timestamp": "14:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um"}

{"timestamp": "14:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh"}
{"timestamp": "14:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control ."}

{"timestamp": "15:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think ."}

{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide ."}
{"timestamp": "15:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay .

{"timestamp": "17:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then"}
{"timestamp": "17:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Then you you put the switch button , then it"}

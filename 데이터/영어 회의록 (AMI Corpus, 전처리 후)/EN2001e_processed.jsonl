Dave , I think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct . But that could be because of the input data .

I by the way , I read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type . Um that's basically it's it's t going on about this fancy called geometric mean , which effectively just means multiplying them . But I I have some good f information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors , because it's uh like it it's for something very similar . Somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together . And there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs . So there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way , but still a way that we can sort of justify ."}

So the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal , but that's something we have to sort out . But this is working in general .

Otherwise I can see if I can still understand , like I did it in my programme . It's uh it's really stupid .

{"timestamp": "03:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I suppose . But the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored , it prefers the first ones it sees ."}

{"timestamp": "04:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think proportion like I even though I'm I'm always getting myself confused about this , but I think sort of making the summary length thing generally proportion , like as a as a proportional factor of of its original length is a good way of going about it . Because anything with absolute length's sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff . So if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what I've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length . So yeah . And that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and like show 'cause that's that's functionality . Yeah , that's sort of like your level of the zoom . Of impending doom . Shall we quit here ? Anything to be discussed ?"}

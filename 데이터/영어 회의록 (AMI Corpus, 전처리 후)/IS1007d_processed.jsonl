And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material ."}

{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "15:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "16:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like ."}

{"timestamp": "16:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm mm ."}
{"timestamp": "16:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes .

{"timestamp": "16:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ?"}
{"timestamp": "17:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um ."}

{"timestamp": "17:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is"}

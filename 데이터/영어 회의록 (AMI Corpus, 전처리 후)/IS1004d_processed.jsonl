{"timestamp": "20:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No I said five ."}
{"timestamp": "20:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay just just do a sum ."}
{"timestamp": "20:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's not very promising but you know"}
{"timestamp": "20:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No because there are more yeah , we shouldn't sum like that ."}
{"timestamp": "20:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob"}
{"timestamp": "20:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell ."}
{"timestamp": "20:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "20:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well just leave it at that then ."}
{"timestamp": "20:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oops ."}
{"timestamp": "20:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it ."}
{"timestamp": "20:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No . I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so ."}
{"timestamp": "21:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So let's move uh let's move on . Okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five ."}
{"timestamp": "21:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , sure ."}
{"timestamp": "21:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells ."}
{"timestamp": "21:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "21:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh yeah finally we say no . Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . So hand dynamo . This something we didn't thought about ."}
{"timestamp": "21:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that ."}
{"timestamp": "22:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You mean , charging it by shaking the banana ."}
{"timestamp": "22:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Okay so we we stick to battery , one ."}
{"timestamp": "22:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No kinetic also . I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo ."}
{"timestamp": "22:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . Crazy . Okay . So those banana is falling ."}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "S"}
{"timestamp": "22:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Let's go ahead . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the ."}
{"timestamp": "22:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one ."}
{"timestamp": "22:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "22:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "23:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . No so we hin"}
{"timestamp": "23:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And we have sample speaker . Yeah . Yeah . the cost of that is very high ."}
{"timestamp": "23:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The beep ."}
{"timestamp": "23:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh-huh ."}
{"timestamp": "23:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so I'll remove it ."}

{"timestamp": "23:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And we have sev"}
{"timestamp": "23:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . So we we'll put some extras , if there is something ."}
{"timestamp": "23:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah maybe . We'll see later . Okay so in for the case um"}
{"timestamp": "23:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Because we have two things ."}
{"timestamp": "23:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "23:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well d yeah it's monotonic but"}
{"timestamp": "24:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "it's got but if you hold it"}
{"timestamp": "24:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "if you hold it that way that's two curved ,"}
{"timestamp": "24:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides ."}
{"timestamp": "24:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well ."}
{"timestamp": "24:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Actually what's the differen"}
{"timestamp": "24:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "What a what i if I put one here ."}
{"timestamp": "24:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "This is actually I mean this probably"}
{"timestamp": "24:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right . So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing ."}
{"timestamp": "24:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "24:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "24:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , it's too no ."}
{"timestamp": "24:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's too expensive ."}
{"timestamp": "24:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well when okay . Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in ."}
{"timestamp": "24:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We're already at eleven ."}
{"timestamp": "24:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so I put rubber one ."}
{"timestamp": "24:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We don't have any push buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "24:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , we have two push buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "24:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We have three ."}
{"timestamp": "24:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that ."}
{"timestamp": "24:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Huh ."}
{"timestamp": "25:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No no . We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "25:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Ah okay , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "25:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay it's gonna have to be plastic ."}
{"timestamp": "25:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here ."}
{"timestamp": "25:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No it's no chip . This is just radio frequency . Th This is no chip ."}
{"timestamp": "25:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah but"}
{"timestamp": "25:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No . There's no chip there . It just emits the signal . And the receiver accepts it and that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "25:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Fo i it does nothing actually ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No . Just only ."}
{"timestamp": "25:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just se sends the signal , that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "25:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "25:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well I actually did um"}
{"timestamp": "25:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class ."}
{"timestamp": "25:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that ."}
{"timestamp": "26:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So no L_C_D_ ,"}
{"timestamp": "26:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "so for we have no button supplements , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yep . No ."}
{"timestamp": "26:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "26:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so we are over budget ."}
{"timestamp": "26:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . So first thing which we should take care of is ,"}
{"timestamp": "26:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Make it plastic instead of rubber . And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents ."}
{"timestamp": "26:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "instead of rubber , let it be plastic ."}
{"timestamp": "26:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there ."}
{"timestamp": "26:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So mayb in fact n we have to put two here"}
{"timestamp": "26:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "because it cost nothing ."}
{"timestamp": "27:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff ."}
{"timestamp": "27:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "27:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah maybe ."}

{"timestamp": "27:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Excellent ."}
{"timestamp": "27:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So what do we do with the extra profits ?"}
{"timestamp": "27:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . The next fruit ."}
{"timestamp": "27:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to through to project evaluation ."}
{"timestamp": "27:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . Would yeah , would buy ."}
{"timestamp": "27:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Sorry ?"}
{"timestamp": "27:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it . We're n yeah . We're not in Milan or Paris ."}
{"timestamp": "27:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah would buy , yeah . Massively , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "28:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "28:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "28:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much ."}
{"timestamp": "29:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity ."}

{"timestamp": "29:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "29:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation ."}
{"timestamp": "29:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of"}

{"timestamp": "29:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "pointless ."}
{"timestamp": "29:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation"}
{"timestamp": "29:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing ."}

Might have to draw a face on it ."}
{"timestamp": "30:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "00:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components ."}
{"timestamp": "01:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes ."}
{"timestamp": "01:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes ."}
{"timestamp": "01:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?"}
{"timestamp": "01:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "01:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ? Everything fine ? That's nice ."}
{"timestamp": "01:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials ."}
{"timestamp": "02:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out ."}
{"timestamp": "02:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers ."}
{"timestamp": "02:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations ."}
{"timestamp": "02:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sure . I'll start off then ."}
{"timestamp": "03:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Doh ."}
{"timestamp": "03:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires ."}
{"timestamp": "03:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the"}
{"timestamp": "03:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor ."}
{"timestamp": "04:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "04:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal ."}
{"timestamp": "04:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much"}
{"timestamp": "05:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have ."}
{"timestamp": "05:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the"}
{"timestamp": "05:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "06:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station ."}
{"timestamp": "06:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped ."}
{"timestamp": "06:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well"}
{"timestamp": "07:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "people with less means ."}
{"timestamp": "07:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That would be all ."}

{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Any questions ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm no ."}
{"timestamp": "07:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ? Okay , we go on to the next one ."}
{"timestamp": "07:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh"}
{"timestamp": "08:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions ."}
{"timestamp": "09:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles ."}
{"timestamp": "10:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh"}
{"timestamp": "10:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine ."}
{"timestamp": "11:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "11:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "See ."}
{"timestamp": "12:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh"}
{"timestamp": "12:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh"}
{"timestamp": "13:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "13:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option ."}
{"timestamp": "13:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions ."}
{"timestamp": "14:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen ."}
{"timestamp": "14:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall ."}
{"timestamp": "14:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "15:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Thank you ."}
{"timestamp": "15:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts ."}
{"timestamp": "15:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So these are the points we have to discuss ."}
{"timestamp": "15:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um first"}
{"timestamp": "15:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um"}
{"timestamp": "16:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so"}
{"timestamp": "16:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think ."}
{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy ."}
{"timestamp": "16:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "16:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "16:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "You use it and it works ."}
{"timestamp": "16:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it ."}
{"timestamp": "16:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Nah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um"}
{"timestamp": "17:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "17:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "get great popularity for our product ."}
{"timestamp": "17:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But"}
{"timestamp": "17:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um wel"}
{"timestamp": "17:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries ."}
{"timestamp": "17:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there ."}
{"timestamp": "17:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "B b"}
{"timestamp": "17:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place ."}
{"timestamp": "18:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "18:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . That's true . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping ."}
{"timestamp": "18:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "18:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "18:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels ."}
{"timestamp": "18:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "18:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's safe ."}
{"timestamp": "18:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?"}
{"timestamp": "18:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . That's a good point ."}
{"timestamp": "18:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department ."}
{"timestamp": "18:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "18:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard ."}
{"timestamp": "19:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , sure . Go ahead ."}
{"timestamp": "19:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um so it was open here ."}
{"timestamp": "19:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um we also um"}
{"timestamp": "19:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control"}
{"timestamp": "19:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "19:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "19:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the"}
{"timestamp": "19:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "19:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "19:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "younger people ."}
{"timestamp": "19:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess ."}
{"timestamp": "19:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "19:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use ."}
{"timestamp": "20:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use ."}
{"timestamp": "20:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "20:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point ."}
{"timestamp": "20:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones ."}
{"timestamp": "20:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "20:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So pretty large ."}
{"timestamp": "20:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it ."}
{"timestamp": "20:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "20:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well ."}
{"timestamp": "21:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "21:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "21:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well ."}
{"timestamp": "21:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "21:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that's the best choice ."}
{"timestamp": "21:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip ."}
{"timestamp": "21:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced ."}
{"timestamp": "21:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just the advanced ."}
{"timestamp": "22:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , advanced chip ."}
{"timestamp": "22:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "22:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?"}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "22:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "22:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just"}

{"timestamp": "23:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "23:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?"}
{"timestamp": "23:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research ."}
{"timestamp": "23:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You don't know ?"}
{"timestamp": "23:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think so because Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape ."}

{"timestamp": "23:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So"}

{"timestamp": "23:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Change the cases . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well ."}
{"timestamp": "24:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah that is true ."}

{"timestamp": "24:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though ."}
{"timestamp": "24:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Costs ."}
{"timestamp": "24:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a"}

{"timestamp": "24:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones"}
{"timestamp": "24:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example ."}
{"timestamp": "24:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um"}
{"timestamp": "25:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Remote ."}
{"timestamp": "25:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one ."}

{"timestamp": "25:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem ."}
{"timestamp": "25:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So everybody's okay with the changing covers ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "25:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think that's a good uh good option ."}

{"timestamp": "25:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ?"}

{"timestamp": "25:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases ."}
{"timestamp": "25:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And what would single curved and double curved mean ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality ."}
{"timestamp": "25:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "26:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So we can pretty much just do whatever we want ."}
{"timestamp": "26:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Pick one you like , yes ."}

{"timestamp": "33:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And to put uh the the buttons for um"}
{"timestamp": "34:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top ."}

So let's say we play the whole au phrase , but then in addition to that , we have some information that says minus that part of something . That's okay , that we can do ."}

{"timestamp": "17:12", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , maybe even I mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get . If maybe if we realise that there's massive differences in in gain or in something , you can probably just make some simple simple normalization , but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary . Yeah , if like I d I don't know anything about audio and I have never seen the player . So if you find that the player accepts some n input from memory , and if it's easy to do , then I guess that's that's fairly doable .

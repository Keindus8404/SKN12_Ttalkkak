And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds .

{"timestamp": "11:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know .

{"timestamp": "12:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one ."}

Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh .

And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those ."}

Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users ."}

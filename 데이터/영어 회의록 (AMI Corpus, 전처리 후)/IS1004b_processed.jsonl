{"timestamp": "06:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .

{"timestamp": "08:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "cut out some a lot of your market ."}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . Sorry ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well maybe it could be a universal design . A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sorry ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:24", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The first and the third point , they are clashing ."}
{"timestamp": "09:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand ."}

{"timestamp": "09:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then ."}
{"timestamp": "09:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something ."}
{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? Little sleek , longer ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And it should fit the hand ."}
{"timestamp": "09:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No no I was thinking of so like something yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Something with the shape of the palm ?"}

{"timestamp": "10:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget"}
{"timestamp": "10:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "would be large enough ."}
{"timestamp": "10:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology ."}
{"timestamp": "10:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "10:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "11:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "11:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Excellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now"}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product ."}
{"timestamp": "11:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah yeah . Sure sure . So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco"}
{"timestamp": "11:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yep . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Sorry , what is your ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh participant three ."}
{"timestamp": "12:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so ."}
{"timestamp": "12:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah . Yeah uh channel fifty ."}
{"timestamp": "12:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No it could be command control kind of thing . It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated ."}
{"timestamp": "12:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . Otherwise it's just lying idle ."}
{"timestamp": "12:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay Michael ."}
{"timestamp": "13:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Sorry ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . Thanks ."}
{"timestamp": "13:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The wheel doesn't work ."}
{"timestamp": "13:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh"}
{"timestamp": "13:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "14:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times ."}
{"timestamp": "14:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . Now um"}
{"timestamp": "15:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Change the channels . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy ."}
{"timestamp": "15:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability ."}
{"timestamp": "15:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but"}
{"timestamp": "15:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel ."}
{"timestamp": "16:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price ."}
{"timestamp": "16:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions ."}
{"timestamp": "16:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "17:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . Because the same button is doing too many things ."}
{"timestamp": "17:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah well we w"}
{"timestamp": "17:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um"}

{"timestamp": "19:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?"}
{"timestamp": "19:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , but yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing ."}
{"timestamp": "19:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well ."}
{"timestamp": "19:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "19:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room ."}
{"timestamp": "20:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics ."}
{"timestamp": "20:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Okay , thanks ."}
{"timestamp": "20:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yep . So yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I yeah , it should be ."}
{"timestamp": "21:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "This one ?"}
{"timestamp": "21:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Great . No , not that one ."}
{"timestamp": "21:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Two ."}
{"timestamp": "21:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can"}
{"timestamp": "21:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing ."}
{"timestamp": "21:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel ."}
{"timestamp": "21:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces . Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking ."}
{"timestamp": "22:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "22:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "22:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote ."}
{"timestamp": "22:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . That increases the the cost also ."}
{"timestamp": "23:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that ."}
{"timestamp": "23:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?"}
{"timestamp": "23:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough ."}
{"timestamp": "23:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc"}
{"timestamp": "23:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . So it could be s a few centimetres ."}

{"timestamp": "24:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No no . Components . Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there ."}
{"timestamp": "24:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ? Components ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver ."}
{"timestamp": "25:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in ."}
{"timestamp": "25:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "To have different technologies . So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . So these are the slight problems ."}
{"timestamp": "26:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So your"}

{"timestamp": "27:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .

{"timestamp": "27:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .

Maybe this is something we can stick to it ."}
{"timestamp": "27:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .

{"timestamp": "28:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well it depends though well it depends . If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus .

{"timestamp": "29:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible . But but I dunno , I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics .

{"timestamp": "34:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop"}
{"timestamp": "34:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know ."}
{"timestamp": "34:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right ."}

{"timestamp": "35:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}

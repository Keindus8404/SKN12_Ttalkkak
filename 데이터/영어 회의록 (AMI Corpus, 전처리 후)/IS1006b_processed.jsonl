{"timestamp": "03:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And next please ."}
{"timestamp": "03:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "03:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "First of all , they find it very ugly . Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking ."}
{"timestamp": "03:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um ."}
{"timestamp": "04:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "04:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another ."}
{"timestamp": "04:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using ."}
{"timestamp": "04:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um next please . Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is ."}
{"timestamp": "05:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? Like uh something to to like t I think phones .

{"timestamp": "05:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Agree ."}
{"timestamp": "05:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls ."}

{"timestamp": "07:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course .

{"timestamp": "08:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so ."}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet ."}

{"timestamp": "08:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "09:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want ."}
{"timestamp": "09:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant ."}
{"timestamp": "09:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down .

{"timestamp": "10:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?"}

{"timestamp": "20:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices ."}

{"timestamp": "21:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Alright ? Thanks for your attention ."}
{"timestamp": "21:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now the technical aspects of this new device ."}
{"timestamp": "21:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "21:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Two ."}
{"timestamp": "22:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera ."}
{"timestamp": "22:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "23:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that ."}
{"timestamp": "23:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device ."}
{"timestamp": "23:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It's generally in the form of infrared or"}
{"timestamp": "23:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want ."}
{"timestamp": "23:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want ,"}
{"timestamp": "24:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format ."}
{"timestamp": "24:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device ."}
{"timestamp": "24:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things ."}
{"timestamp": "24:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "24:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "24:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh ."}
{"timestamp": "24:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good ."}
{"timestamp": "24:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes ."}
{"timestamp": "25:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device ."}
{"timestamp": "25:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them ."}
{"timestamp": "25:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip .

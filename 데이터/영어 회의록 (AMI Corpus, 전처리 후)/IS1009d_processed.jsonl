And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . So we have to get some input from those people . And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it .

I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it ."}

The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors ."}

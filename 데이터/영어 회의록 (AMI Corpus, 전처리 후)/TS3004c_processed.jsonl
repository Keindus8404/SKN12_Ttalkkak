{"timestamp": "11:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's the most important part , I think . But And the home base is something like that , something simple ."}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "11:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , maybe the teletext tel"}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well ."}

{"timestamp": "12:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up"}
{"timestamp": "12:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "much more than that part . So the focus is on these two parts ."}
{"timestamp": "12:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So you don't see all the buttons you else need ."}
{"timestamp": "12:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . So you can't use your thumb for it ."}
{"timestamp": "12:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Here uh Well we have volume ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it is on uh on the bottom too ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , down there ."}
{"timestamp": "12:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But it's not not the best best ."}
{"timestamp": "12:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls ."}
{"timestamp": "13:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , okay . Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too ."}
{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . Yeah , why not ."}
{"timestamp": "13:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more ."}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Scroll ."}
{"timestamp": "13:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "By just putting the volume on the side . And and just channel buttons here ."}

{"timestamp": "13:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control ."}
{"timestamp": "13:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Basically it's it's here ."}
{"timestamp": "13:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom ."}
{"timestamp": "13:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , that's better ."}
{"timestamp": "13:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "They're on top ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom ."}
{"timestamp": "13:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons ."}

{"timestamp": "13:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh okay . Well , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three ."}
{"timestamp": "14:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So maybe we can put that on the bottom ."}
{"timestamp": "14:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time ."}
{"timestamp": "14:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be"}
{"timestamp": "14:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "should be easy to ."}
{"timestamp": "14:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top ."}
{"timestamp": "14:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there ."}
{"timestamp": "14:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use ."}
{"timestamp": "14:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half ."}
{"timestamp": "14:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . But uh we we can switch those two , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open ."}
{"timestamp": "15:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Yeah , that's cool ."}
{"timestamp": "15:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "15:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No ."}

{"timestamp": "18:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well one of the options . You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . So you can just replace them I think ."}

{"timestamp": "18:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , we could do that ."}

{"timestamp": "22:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , a recharger maybe ."}

{"timestamp": "22:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . Not a separate Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one ."}
{"timestamp": "22:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , just rechargeable batteries ."}
{"timestamp": "23:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda ."}
{"timestamp": "23:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah cool ."}
{"timestamp": "23:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So if you hold it , it gets powered ."}
{"timestamp": "23:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch ."}
{"timestamp": "23:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "If you hold it ."}
{"timestamp": "23:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's dark in the room . No . It's just batteries , that's cheaper ."}
{"timestamp": "23:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth ."}

{"timestamp": "23:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons ."}

{"timestamp": "32:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well ."}
{"timestamp": "32:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "32:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then ."}
{"timestamp": "32:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Which w"}
{"timestamp": "32:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Here you see one that's very round ."}
{"timestamp": "32:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh yeah , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "32:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So I think that can be all kind of shapes ."}
{"timestamp": "32:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit ."}
{"timestamp": "33:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's all . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Of the remote control ?"}
{"timestamp": "33:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just round it up ."}
{"timestamp": "33:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No . Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "More rounded ."}
{"timestamp": "33:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's This is also rounded . I think i"}
{"timestamp": "33:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , just just the corners ."}
{"timestamp": "33:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "33:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes ."}
{"timestamp": "33:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Shapes ."}
{"timestamp": "33:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new ."}
{"timestamp": "33:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Not in depth ."}
{"timestamp": "33:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but Yeah , if if we want to make it"}
{"timestamp": "33:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "kind of , yeah , new ."}
{"timestamp": "33:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done ."}
{"timestamp": "33:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?"}
{"timestamp": "34:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "34:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "34:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving ."}
{"timestamp": "34:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh it's very annoying . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "34:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "34:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I dunno if it's handy ."}
{"timestamp": "34:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "This ? The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing ."}
{"timestamp": "34:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "34:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here"}
{"timestamp": "35:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "35:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Curves , curves ."}
{"timestamp": "35:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "35:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You've more there as well ."}
{"timestamp": "35:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "35:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It wasn't very small one ."}
{"timestamp": "35:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "35:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That is for elderly ."}
{"timestamp": "35:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have ."}
{"timestamp": "35:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "35:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "35:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours ."}
{"timestamp": "35:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "35:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player ."}
{"timestamp": "35:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And you have the scroll button inside . Okay . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well ."}
{"timestamp": "36:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes . Just a simple scrollb"}
{"timestamp": "36:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Doesn't have to be ."}
{"timestamp": "36:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Yeah , it's cool ."}
{"timestamp": "36:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Rubber spongy ."}
{"timestamp": "36:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "spongy and fruity . But yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Spongeball kinda ."}
{"timestamp": "36:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square ."}
{"timestamp": "36:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff ."}
{"timestamp": "36:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It The th th"}
{"timestamp": "36:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "36:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public ."}
{"timestamp": "37:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , they're all the same ."}
{"timestamp": "37:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction ."}
{"timestamp": "37:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "37:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , we could do that ."}
{"timestamp": "37:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Could ."}
{"timestamp": "37:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow ."}
{"timestamp": "37:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "37:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , I think Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "37:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's right ."}
{"timestamp": "37:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . So it will just be a small"}
{"timestamp": "37:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "37:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much ."}
{"timestamp": "37:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly ."}
{"timestamp": "38:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So maybe you have to ask her ."}
{"timestamp": "38:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "38:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint ."}
{"timestamp": "38:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I'll be able to do a better job ."}
{"timestamp": "38:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here ."}
{"timestamp": "38:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Doesn't work ."}
{"timestamp": "38:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I'll see it ."}
{"timestamp": "38:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Is that okay ?"}
{"timestamp": "38:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod ."}
{"timestamp": "38:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition ."}
{"timestamp": "38:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a"}
{"timestamp": "38:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "advanced chip ."}
{"timestamp": "38:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "38:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh strange that I received the information about that ."}
{"timestamp": "39:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said ."}
{"timestamp": "39:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , okay ?"}
{"timestamp": "39:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The function of that in there . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "39:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then ."}
{"timestamp": "39:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Fine ."}
{"timestamp": "39:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , we probably do ."}
{"timestamp": "39:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ?"}
{"timestamp": "39:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "39:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But we don't have any f information about the cost ."}
{"timestamp": "39:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "39:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "We started with information about the cost was now th"}
{"timestamp": "39:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip ."}
{"timestamp": "39:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question ."}
{"timestamp": "40:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Doesn't say . Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample ."}
{"timestamp": "40:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning ."}
{"timestamp": "40:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No . Does it say does it say something back ?"}
{"timestamp": "40:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah uh th that's just It's a No . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it ."}
{"timestamp": "40:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But i it's a separate chip ."}
{"timestamp": "40:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well ."}
{"timestamp": "40:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "40:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I don't know anything about this , but Nah ."}
{"timestamp": "40:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult ."}
{"timestamp": "40:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well it it would be would be a good feature feature ."}
{"timestamp": "40:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "40:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . We have to stop now . Okay , just We have to stop it now ."}
{"timestamp": "40:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . No no worries about the cost , etcetera . And there's a chip in it that will Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "40:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Fine ."}

[00:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[00:33] Speaker_A | So we are here for the concept design meeting .
"[00:38] Speaker_A | So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken ."
[00:48] Speaker_A | Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
[00:59] Speaker_A | So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .
"[01:12] Speaker_A | We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting ."
"[01:25] Speaker_A | So , last time we decided to have a simple interface ."
[01:31] Speaker_A | We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple .
"[01:48] Speaker_A | We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ ."
"[01:55] Speaker_A | We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features ."
"[02:11] Speaker_A | So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert ."
[02:25] Speaker_C | Abdul al-Hasred is my name .
[02:37] Speaker_A | So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .
[02:44] Speaker_A | So this is the presentation .
"[02:47] Speaker_B | Uh , I_D_ you want ?"
[02:52] Speaker_A | Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .
[02:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:00] Speaker_B | um just this .
"[03:03] Speaker_B | On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously ,"
[03:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:11] Speaker_B | you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
[03:19] Speaker_B | and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .
"[03:24] Speaker_B | So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button ."
"[03:36] Speaker_B | And um yeah we can change directly . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive ."
[03:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:59] Speaker_B | And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .
[04:10] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:11] Speaker_B | Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .
[04:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:17] Speaker_A | But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .
[04:17] Speaker_C | Mm .
[04:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[04:29] Speaker_A | So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?"
[04:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:48] Speaker_C | Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?
[04:55] Speaker_B | Um that's all yeah . I haven't chec
[04:58] Speaker_C | No ?
[05:00] Speaker_C | Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
[05:08] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[05:19] Speaker_A | And could it be adapted ?
[05:21] Speaker_C | I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .
[05:28] Speaker_A | Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?
"[05:30] Speaker_C | Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip"
[05:34] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:37] Speaker_C | then we we could use it .
[05:38] Speaker_A | Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .
[05:44] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[05:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r"
"[05:58] Speaker_B | wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that ."
[06:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:05] Speaker_B | We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .
[06:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[06:15] Speaker_C | I have a question about that actually . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?"
[06:27] Speaker_A | You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
"[06:33] Speaker_C | Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?"
"[06:37] Speaker_A | It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?"
"[06:43] Speaker_C | But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it ."
[06:45] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[06:47] Speaker_C | You can see the buttons better , of course . Yeah ."
[06:49] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[06:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . True .
[06:54] Speaker_B | Yeah . Actually .
[06:54] Speaker_C | But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .
[07:02] Speaker_B | As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
"[07:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?"
[07:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . Again .
[07:10] Speaker_C | Yeah no it's too expensive .
[07:19] Speaker_C | Okay .
[07:21] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[07:24] Speaker_C | Extra . Yeah , okay ."
[07:27] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[07:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah ."
[07:41] Speaker_C | Mm .
[07:44] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[07:46] Speaker_A | But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?"
[07:51] Speaker_A | To have the light always on ?
"[07:51] Speaker_B | Yeah , a little bit ."
[07:54] Speaker_B | A little bit .
[07:54] Speaker_C | Mm .
[07:55] Speaker_A | Well we will discuss that after maybe
[07:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:58] Speaker_C | Okay . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder ."
[07:59] Speaker_A | the other presentations .
[08:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:04] Speaker_C | So .
[08:06] Speaker_C | It was last time I saw it .
[08:10] Speaker_A | And it is .
[08:16] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[08:21] Speaker_C | So , just move to the next slide ."
[08:22] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:32] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
"[08:34] Speaker_C | So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler ."
[08:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:52] Speaker_C | Um . So .
[08:53] Speaker_A | And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .
"[08:57] Speaker_C | Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so ."
"[09:05] Speaker_C | We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle ."
[09:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:10] Speaker_C | So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? These are the basic thing ."
[09:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:26] Speaker_A | Yeah . So it's only the central part .
"[09:29] Speaker_C | So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two ."
[09:34] Speaker_A | Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
"[09:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have ."
[09:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:52] Speaker_C | And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
[09:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[09:57] Speaker_C | you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way ."
[10:01] Speaker_A | Okay . S
[10:07] Speaker_A | Okay . Will be down or Okay .
"[10:07] Speaker_C | So that they're separate a bit , yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either ."
"[10:18] Speaker_C | Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user ."
[10:22] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:25] Speaker_C | Alright , you won't yeah . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . Yeah . That you want to protect a bit ."
[10:34] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:39] Speaker_C | And I think it's uh it's reasonable .
[10:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:45] Speaker_C | Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want ."
[10:47] Speaker_A | Mm .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[10:54] Speaker_C | Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
[11:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:04] Speaker_A | Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .
[11:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[11:10] Speaker_A | Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .
[11:15] Speaker_A | So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .
[11:20] Speaker_B | To s
[11:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[11:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that ."
[11:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:31] Speaker_A | So we can move to the Is there any question ? For
"[11:37] Speaker_A | designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ?"
[11:54] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:54] Speaker_D | Okay , I can go ?"
[11:56] Speaker_D | Can I ?
[11:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:08] Speaker_D | So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative ."
[12:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[12:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_D | after .
"[12:49] Speaker_D | And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures ."
[13:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:13] Speaker_B | I support an apple .
[13:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:26] Speaker_C | Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? Yeah ."
[13:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . Yeah , because it's robust ."
[13:37] Speaker_C | You can throw it to the television .
"[13:38] Speaker_D | Okay It's robust , yeah ."
[13:39] Speaker_B | Yeah . Me too .
"[13:41] Speaker_C | Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off ."
[13:49] Speaker_C | When it d uh takes a shock .
[13:51] Speaker_A | Yeah uh sorry ?
[13:52] Speaker_B | Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also .
"[13:55] Speaker_D | An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use ."
[13:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:00] Speaker_A | No .
[14:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:03] Speaker_A | Before ?
[14:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . Has it ?
[14:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:19] Speaker_D | Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
[14:25] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .
[14:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[14:30] Speaker_D | Innovative . Mm .
[14:34] Speaker_C | How do we make it look cool is the question .
"[14:37] Speaker_A | Cool , fancy ?"
[14:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:44] Speaker_D | Yeah . Mm .
"[14:46] Speaker_A | Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that ."
"[14:50] Speaker_D | Oh , colour , yeah ."
"[14:53] Speaker_C | Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess ."
"[15:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well ."
[15:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:07] Speaker_A | A pear .
[15:07] Speaker_C | The banana is also ergonomic .
[15:10] Speaker_A | Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
[15:12] Speaker_D | Or a fruit like that . I dunno .
[15:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?
[15:18] Speaker_C | Is there any fruit that is spongy ?
[15:31] Speaker_A | Something like that .
"[15:31] Speaker_B | And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,"
[15:37] Speaker_B | with blue L_E_D_ inside ?
"[15:40] Speaker_A | But that's not in the trend . . The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits ."
[15:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[15:45] Speaker_C | It's not hard , the metal ."
[15:53] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[15:54] Speaker_A | So , I think we can keep the wheel"
"[15:57] Speaker_A | because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have ."
[15:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:30] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[16:34] Speaker_B | Banana I think , it's a nice idea ."
[16:36] Speaker_A | Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
[16:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:45] Speaker_C | Two of the button , yeah ."
[16:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:57] Speaker_A | I think it's a good idea , yeah ."
"[16:57] Speaker_C | Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , no ?"
[17:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .
[17:17] Speaker_C | You can put also vibrator inside .
[17:17] Speaker_B | And everybody knows what is a banana . Basically . If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha
[17:23] Speaker_C | Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:32] Speaker_A | Yeah it's really uh really a good point .
[17:47] Speaker_C | Now who are recording this meeting ?
[17:54] Speaker_A | One second .
"[18:16] Speaker_A | we have to think about those aspects , sorry ."
[18:19] Speaker_B | So we will just use a a standard battery ?
[18:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:23] Speaker_B | And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?
"[18:32] Speaker_A | I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape ."
[18:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:36] Speaker_B | Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it ."
[18:43] Speaker_C | The only th
[18:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:49] Speaker_C | Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot ."
[18:51] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah . Yeah .
[18:57] Speaker_B | Spongy also .
"[19:08] Speaker_C | So if we try to push the buttons , it You think it's possible ?"
[19:08] Speaker_B | Oh no I think it's possible .
"[19:10] Speaker_A | No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover ."
[19:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:16] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:34] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[19:44] Speaker_C | Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?"
[19:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:52] Speaker_A | So it have to it has to be symmetrical .
"[19:55] Speaker_C | Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel ."
[20:06] Speaker_B | Yep . Yep .
[20:12] Speaker_A | Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .
[20:15] Speaker_C | This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? Should have the two sides .
[20:17] Speaker_A | Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .
[20:20] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:24] Speaker_C | the op
[20:25] Speaker_A | I think you can turn it this way also .
[20:28] Speaker_A | You can do both with both hands .
"[20:28] Speaker_C | Wheel Wheel buttons . Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side ."
[20:31] Speaker_A | I think it's okay .
[20:36] Speaker_C | So you cannot see them .
"[20:38] Speaker_A | Well , you you will get used to it . And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons ."
[20:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:51] Speaker_C | Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side ."
[20:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[21:00] Speaker_A | No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty ."
"[21:08] Speaker_A | I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well ."
[21:15] Speaker_A | I think this doesn't change that much .
[21:19] Speaker_C | Okay .
[21:20] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[21:22] Speaker_C | Okay . Maybe .
[21:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:26] Speaker_A | So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side ."
[21:40] Speaker_A | and uh a wheel on the top .
[21:42] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:51] Speaker_A | So the colour is yellow .
[21:55] Speaker_A | I think it's uh we defined everything according to
"[22:00] Speaker_A | what we should what the decision we should take , yeah ."
[22:06] Speaker_A | So maybe we can um
[22:09] Speaker_A | we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision .
[22:23] Speaker_A | And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product .
"[22:30] Speaker_A | That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use ."
[22:50] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[22:54] Speaker_A | to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh
"[23:05] Speaker_A | be better , I think ."
[23:10] Speaker_A | And so uh
"[23:12] Speaker_A | you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual ."
[23:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yes master .
[23:17] Speaker_A | So do you need to add anything ?
[23:23] Speaker_C | No .
[23:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:26] Speaker_A | You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ?
[23:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:34] Speaker_C | No .
[23:37] Speaker_C | Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay .
[23:44] Speaker_B | Thank you .
[23:45] Speaker_A | See you .

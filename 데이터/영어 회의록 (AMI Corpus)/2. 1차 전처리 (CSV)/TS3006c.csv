[01:14] Speaker_D | Hello .
"[01:21] Speaker_D | Yes , I made it ."
[01:31] Speaker_A | Yeah just testing .
[01:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:35] Speaker_A | Mm ?
[01:38] Speaker_A | English .
[01:42] Speaker_C | So annoying .
[01:44] Speaker_A | Break is over .
[01:45] Speaker_D | Ooh it works .
[01:46] Speaker_A | Whoo . Spicy .
[01:52] Speaker_D | Where are are all the other presentations ?
[02:04] Speaker_D | Ah . Because I see only my own presentation yeah .
"[02:08] Speaker_C | No no no , can you go back one ?"
"[02:11] Speaker_C | Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it ."
[02:14] Speaker_D | This ?
"[02:18] Speaker_A | So , he's coming ."
[02:22] Speaker_D | Or not .
[02:24] Speaker_B | Okay .
[02:25] Speaker_A | Oh okay .
"[02:29] Speaker_A | Ah . She . You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else ."
[02:39] Speaker_D | Move to meeting room .
[02:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:46] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[02:47] Speaker_D | Yeah me too , ."
[02:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:58] Speaker_A | Yeah . Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . So who wants go .
[03:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:15] Speaker_D | Yes . Me first again or yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or no . Ah .
[03:16] Speaker_A | Yes ?
[03:16] Speaker_C | Who wants to start ?
[03:18] Speaker_A | Yeah sure . Doesn't matter .
[03:18] Speaker_B | Oh . No . Yeah . No problem
[03:24] Speaker_A | No .
[03:28] Speaker_D | Ah .
[03:31] Speaker_D | Yes .
[03:43] Speaker_D | So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching .
"[04:07] Speaker_D | Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea ."
[04:27] Speaker_D | Um well the developments ? Uh development one . Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface .
"[04:47] Speaker_D | And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , so I don't expect that to be a problem ."
[05:04] Speaker_C | Sound .
[05:06] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah uh uh .
"[05:18] Speaker_D | Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . So um that kind of gets you this ratios . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention ."
[05:27] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[05:36] Speaker_D | Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part . That this will be a crux . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left ."
[05:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:07] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
[06:07] Speaker_B | Do you want to go first ? Okay . Yeah .
[06:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:22] Speaker_A | Cool .
[06:24] Speaker_D | Alright .
[06:24] Speaker_C | Alright .
[06:28] Speaker_C | Uh components .
[06:31] Speaker_A | Yeah layout .
[06:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:34] Speaker_C | Oh no .
[06:35] Speaker_A | Yeah okay .
[06:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . It's okay .
[06:36] Speaker_A | You probably opened it .
[06:40] Speaker_A | F_ five .
[06:41] Speaker_D | F_ five .
"[06:43] Speaker_C | Alright . So I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first ."
"[07:08] Speaker_C | Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type ."
"[07:33] Speaker_C | If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier ."
[08:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[08:23] Speaker_C | And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . So uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . So that's not cool either ."
[08:28] Speaker_D | Wi an indoors . Oh .
[08:31] Speaker_A | Yeah okay .
[08:33] Speaker_A | Calculator's can do it .
[08:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:41] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[08:43] Speaker_C | So um for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now ."
[09:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:07] Speaker_C | Uh the case materials . Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays ."
[09:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:22] Speaker_C | Um poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . So that's not really interesting ."
[09:39] Speaker_B | Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah .
[09:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:46] Speaker_C | Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think"
"[10:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it ."
[10:27] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . As an optional uh feature .
[10:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:33] Speaker_B | Or combine uh both with a with one uh
[10:36] Speaker_D | I guess we can only choose one .
[10:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[10:40] Speaker_C | I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again ."
[10:50] Speaker_D | Yeah . And it's more fun .
[10:50] Speaker_A | Yeah I didn't receive any info uh .
"[10:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , so it's a perfect combination I guess ."
[10:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:01] Speaker_A | S yeah it's safe .
[11:03] Speaker_C | Yeah y exactly . You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . So that's the end of it .
[11:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:09] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:14] Speaker_C | Uh go ahead .
[11:14] Speaker_A | 'Kay next .
"[11:20] Speaker_C | No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah ."
[11:28] Speaker_D | Mm .
[11:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:34] Speaker_D | Also in in height ? Yeah okay .
[11:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:49] Speaker_B | Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control .
[11:57] Speaker_C | Design ?
[12:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . Just yeah . I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . So I don't think you have to design anything else for that .
[12:06] Speaker_B | So okay .
[12:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:15] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:15] Speaker_D | Yeah with the programme .
[12:22] Speaker_A | Both .
[12:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:38] Speaker_B | Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's
[12:46] Speaker_B | yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control .
[12:57] Speaker_B | And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .
"[13:03] Speaker_D | And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess ."
[13:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:29] Speaker_A | That would be the back .
[13:31] Speaker_B | The back .
[13:31] Speaker_D | Yeah . Back and okay .
[13:31] Speaker_A | Back and okay .
[13:34] Speaker_A | You did read the minutes I wrote ? You did read the minutes I wrote ?
[13:36] Speaker_B | What ?
[13:40] Speaker_B | A little bit I think but not not everything w
"[14:00] Speaker_B | I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option ."
[14:14] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:30] Speaker_B | Um that was it .
[15:16] Speaker_D | No .
[15:19] Speaker_D | Rubber material .
[15:19] Speaker_C | And rubber . Rubber material .
[15:20] Speaker_A | Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left .
[15:26] Speaker_C | Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function .
"[15:36] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more ."
[15:37] Speaker_A | Advanced chip . Okay .
[15:38] Speaker_D | Wow .
[15:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:42] Speaker_D | Alright . Kinetic . Double curved .
"[15:43] Speaker_C | I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , to be able to m"
[15:43] Speaker_A | Too .
[15:51] Speaker_C | So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . That's gonna be difficult huh ?
[15:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:56] Speaker_D | The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ?
[16:00] Speaker_A | I have total here .
[16:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:03] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_B | We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem .
[16:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:12] Speaker_A | Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ?
[16:15] Speaker_D | Um well the interface type supplements .
[16:20] Speaker_B | Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah .
[16:21] Speaker_A | Ooh .
[16:26] Speaker_A | No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ?
[16:32] Speaker_A | And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder .
[16:34] Speaker_C | Um let me see . Wait a sec .
"[16:36] Speaker_D | If you go to your homepage or something , you should"
[16:38] Speaker_C | Yeah I'm going there now .
[16:40] Speaker_D | get your own information .
[16:42] Speaker_C | Inspiration .
[16:51] Speaker_D | No . Too less time .
"[16:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , also the menu . Yeah that that w"
[17:00] Speaker_B | Yeah . This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at .
"[17:03] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu ."
[17:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:07] Speaker_A | Arrow . Yeah .
[17:08] Speaker_B | Arrow yeah .
[17:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah perfect .
[17:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:16] Speaker_C | Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that ."
[17:16] Speaker_A | 'S the target group .
[17:17] Speaker_B | S yeah .
[17:18] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:37] Speaker_A | Oh okay . I see . Yeah also like this . So you can hold it .
[17:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:52] Speaker_B | But it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people .
[17:59] Speaker_C | It ha
[18:00] Speaker_A | The children's story . Yeah I've got it .
[18:03] Speaker_A | Distinction . Yeah .
"[18:19] Speaker_B | Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it ."
[18:26] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:31] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[18:32] Speaker_C | There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . Maybe we should consider this function . To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera ."
[18:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:47] Speaker_A | Different .
[18:51] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:56] Speaker_A | Camera .
[18:58] Speaker_D | Yeah . Cool . S underwater uh yeah .
[19:04] Speaker_C | Personally I think it's really ugly .
[19:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:07] Speaker_C | Just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe I'm too old for this stuff . Yeah .
[19:09] Speaker_B | Very cheap uh cheap look .
[19:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:10] Speaker_A | Yeah but this this the is for the .
[19:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:16] Speaker_C | So those I think are all my oh .
[19:19] Speaker_A | Ah yeah bright colours .
"[19:20] Speaker_C | And this is , this is with the curved that I mean ."
[19:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:25] Speaker_A | That's singly curved .
[19:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah ?
[19:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:28] Speaker_D | That should be nice .
[19:28] Speaker_A | Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort .
[19:35] Speaker_C | A compromise between what ?
[19:37] Speaker_A | Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved .
[19:42] Speaker_A | So to appeal a little more to the all the public .
[19:42] Speaker_D | So s
"[19:43] Speaker_C | This , this would be uh single curved uh ?"
[19:46] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[19:46] Speaker_D | Yeah there's only in in this dimension . Like this . So curvy or not . Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?
[19:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:51] Speaker_C | Yeah . Exactly . Exactly .
[19:51] Speaker_A | Also .
[19:55] Speaker_A | Yeah that would be an option . I don't know what you think .
[19:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:07] Speaker_A | Yeah I'd agree .
[20:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[20:18] Speaker_B | Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons ."
[20:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:33] Speaker_C | Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that .
[20:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:38] Speaker_C | Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . That would be a nice way to use it but I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think ."
[20:41] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:44] Speaker_B | That's yeah .
[20:46] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:53] Speaker_A | Different .
[20:55] Speaker_A | Stands out .
[20:58] Speaker_A | Oh yeah a one hand uh solution .
[20:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:16] Speaker_D | Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more
[21:22] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it .
"[21:23] Speaker_D | towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here ."
[21:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[21:46] Speaker_C | Yeah I understand what you mean .
[21:55] Speaker_A | If you can uh flip .
[22:02] Speaker_C | Yeah . Something like that .
[22:13] Speaker_A | So and you want to be able to
[22:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:18] Speaker_A | make this
[22:20] Speaker_C | No uh like I would draw it like this .
"[22:26] Speaker_C | Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean . So that it would come up like that ."
[22:36] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
"[22:38] Speaker_A | Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way ."
"[22:42] Speaker_C | Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons ."
[22:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:48] Speaker_D | Oh the advanced buttons . Right .
[22:48] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea .
[22:51] Speaker_B | That's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu .
[22:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:57] Speaker_B | But you you want okay . You just want to hide them all ? The oh .
[22:57] Speaker_C | F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? So w w
[22:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:01] Speaker_A | No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . And the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically ."
[23:07] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah .
[23:18] Speaker_C | Activate and th the yeah .
[23:19] Speaker_D | So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open .
[23:24] Speaker_A | Why ? You could just make it mechanical .
[23:32] Speaker_B | That's but it's it's not
[23:34] Speaker_C | Yeah . Exactly .
[23:36] Speaker_B | it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time .
[23:40] Speaker_D | True . It uh c it can go open .
"[23:41] Speaker_C | Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever ."
[23:43] Speaker_A | If you cover it with rubber .
[23:50] Speaker_D | An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that .
[23:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
[23:50] Speaker_A | Mm .
[23:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . So it can bounce .
[23:55] Speaker_C | Exactly . Exactly . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . Th it's very solid yeah .
[23:58] Speaker_D | It's very no it's very strong . Yeah .
[24:01] Speaker_A | Yeah okay so that that may work .
[24:04] Speaker_A | Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape .
"[24:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th"
[24:15] Speaker_A | Harder .
"[24:16] Speaker_D | Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there ."
"[24:19] Speaker_C | Okay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that ."
"[24:25] Speaker_C | With your uh wrist . That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f"
"[24:35] Speaker_B | But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem ."
[24:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:38] Speaker_C | Uh yeah . Yeah of course . Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . Like like you drew here .
[24:39] Speaker_A | Maybe can design two versions .
[24:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:47] Speaker_C | And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . Anyway .
[24:51] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . And ergonomical shape . Yeah .
[24:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:05] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . Some uh k esk uh yeah .
[25:12] Speaker_B | Okay .
[25:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:13] Speaker_C | Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape ."
[25:17] Speaker_B | Some yeah .
[25:19] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
"[25:20] Speaker_C | And also the screen , you cannot mould it . You know kind of thing ."
[25:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[25:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:30] Speaker_C | You can place the screen here , which can come ."
"[25:34] Speaker_A | Yeah . So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?"
[25:40] Speaker_D | Spongey .
"[25:40] Speaker_C | I would do the arrows here , kind of thing ."
[25:46] Speaker_D | Yeah . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ?
[25:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:53] Speaker_B | No the arrow's over here . Yeah .
[25:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:55] Speaker_D | Yeah and then numbers .
[25:56] Speaker_A | Buttons .
[25:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright .
[26:00] Speaker_D | Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy .
[26:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:29] Speaker_A | Orange or something .
[26:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:44] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[26:44] Speaker_C | Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow ."
[26:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:47] Speaker_B | Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you we uh yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more uh yeah for the people ."
[26:53] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah okay yeah .
"[27:06] Speaker_D | Mm . That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess ."
[27:11] Speaker_D | Oh . What's this ?
[27:12] Speaker_A | Yeah it's text .
[27:14] Speaker_D | Right .
[27:16] Speaker_D | Hm .
[27:22] Speaker_D | Yeah . Two hours further .
[27:28] Speaker_B | So that's blue .
[27:31] Speaker_D | Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ?
[27:33] Speaker_A | Mm .
[27:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . That's what I call painting . So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . It's pretty nice .
[27:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:35] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:41] Speaker_A | Yeah and then on top of that .
[27:48] Speaker_A | Some yellow .
[27:50] Speaker_A | Banana colour .
"[27:52] Speaker_C | And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often ."
[28:07] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[28:19] Speaker_D | How do you mean ?
"[28:21] Speaker_A | Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically ."
[28:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:24] Speaker_C | Yeah . Exactly .
[28:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:29] Speaker_D | Yeah an orange . Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high ."
[28:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:42] Speaker_D | So uh yeah . That would be a nice uh nice device I guess .
[28:51] Speaker_A | Who ?
"[28:52] Speaker_D | I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J"
[28:54] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[28:57] Speaker_A | And then you can use yellow or semething .
[29:04] Speaker_A | Aye .
[29:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:06] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[29:12] Speaker_C | As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . So that people with uh with
[29:18] Speaker_B | Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ?
[29:18] Speaker_A | Like this .
"[29:22] Speaker_D | White backlight , and dark ."
"[29:24] Speaker_B | Dark uh letters , yeah ."
[29:25] Speaker_D | Yeah . Whatever which is visible . I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno .
[29:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:34] Speaker_C | And also for people who are a bit colourblind .
[29:36] Speaker_A | Colourblind yeah .
[29:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . True .
[29:38] Speaker_A | No so that's mostly red and green I believe .
[29:41] Speaker_D | Which which uh colour should the buttons be ?
[29:45] Speaker_B | That's adjustable .
[29:47] Speaker_A | Woah .
[29:49] Speaker_D | Why adjustable ?
[29:49] Speaker_A | All all buttons ?
[29:50] Speaker_B | Yeah ? Or not .
[29:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:53] Speaker_B | That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy .
[30:04] Speaker_A | Blue .
[30:05] Speaker_A | Maybe green .
"[30:06] Speaker_C | But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Like the pictures I showed you guys . Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy ."
[30:15] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[30:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm flashy .
[30:23] Speaker_A | Mm bzz .
[30:25] Speaker_D | Doesn't work very well . Uh . More like this colour .
"[30:29] Speaker_C | Yeah something like that , something that stands out more ."
"[30:30] Speaker_D | And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ?"
[30:35] Speaker_B | Mm .
[30:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:44] Speaker_A | Red maybe .
[30:46] Speaker_A | Black .
[30:49] Speaker_C | The green ?
[30:50] Speaker_A | Why ?
"[30:50] Speaker_D | Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side ."
[30:50] Speaker_B | Yeah . I dunno .
[30:54] Speaker_C | It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment .
[30:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:58] Speaker_D | My couch is in that colour .
[30:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
[31:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:04] Speaker_D | Well it works pretty well .
[31:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:08] Speaker_D | And then time was up .
[31:11] Speaker_A | Uh not yet .
[31:14] Speaker_A | Yeah within five minutes yeah .
[31:16] Speaker_C | Alright .
[31:17] Speaker_A | Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out .
"[31:20] Speaker_D | So something like this . That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . Because the of the green ."
[31:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:28] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
[31:29] Speaker_C | No that's actu
[31:30] Speaker_B | But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?
[31:34] Speaker_A | They have LEDs but they have a colour .
[31:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:39] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[31:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:49] Speaker_B | Okay .
[31:49] Speaker_D | Okay .
[31:51] Speaker_C | I think .
[31:51] Speaker_D | So red buttons are okay ?
[31:53] Speaker_C | I think so .
[31:54] Speaker_B | Okay . That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons .
[31:54] Speaker_A | You can make them red .
[32:08] Speaker_D | How do you mean ? Yeah .
"[32:09] Speaker_A | Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think ."
[32:17] Speaker_D | No that's that's too busy I guess .
[32:17] Speaker_A | 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background . Each number is transparent .
[32:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:24] Speaker_A | Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . So you can't
[32:27] Speaker_B | Okay .
[32:30] Speaker_D | You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . So just an extra
[32:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
[32:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:39] Speaker_A | Bit of light .
"[32:39] Speaker_C | You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . So that the whole button will shine"
[32:39] Speaker_D | bit of light and attention .
[32:40] Speaker_A | Bit of feedback .
[32:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:51] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:13] Speaker_A | Don't mean to discourage you but uh basically
"[33:24] Speaker_C | Ah , right ."
[33:25] Speaker_D | Alright .
[33:28] Speaker_A | You will do the evaluation .
[33:30] Speaker_D | Of the product ? Which we don't have yet .
[33:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:37] Speaker_A | Yeah I don't know . You probably get a mail .
[33:39] Speaker_D | Oh okay . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just because you are going to design it on this board right ?
[33:46] Speaker_A | Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah .
[33:49] Speaker_A | Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know .
[33:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:04] Speaker_A | About . Yeah . You have the basic idea .
[34:06] Speaker_D | I've a basic idea .
[34:07] Speaker_A | And you two uh are going to do this .
[34:10] Speaker_C | So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? Alright . Thanks .
[34:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:13] Speaker_A | Yeah . Good luck . So I uh make new page and uh be creative .
[34:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:25] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[34:25] Speaker_B | But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?"
[34:27] Speaker_A | Yeah you have uh thirty minutes .
[34:29] Speaker_C | Thirty minutes .
[34:31] Speaker_B | Okay .
[34:32] Speaker_A | Then we have to uh see something which we can uh
[34:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:35] Speaker_B | Yeah . Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ?
[34:35] Speaker_C | Alright .
[34:37] Speaker_A | show to the management .
[34:41] Speaker_A | I would yeah .
[34:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:45] Speaker_A | Next .
"[34:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , I just make a new one . Alright ."
"[34:48] Speaker_B | Oh , next ."
[34:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:51] Speaker_A | Oh and save this uh board .
[34:54] Speaker_C | Huh ? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there .
[34:55] Speaker_A | Just save it .
[35:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:00] Speaker_A | It'll be fine .
[35:01] Speaker_D | On the left .
"[35:02] Speaker_D | S so , yeah ."
[35:07] Speaker_C | Uh sorry .
[35:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:25] Speaker_B | And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface .
"[35:28] Speaker_C | Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches ."
[35:30] Speaker_D | This ?
[35:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:34] Speaker_D | Uh pretty accurate .
[35:40] Speaker_D | Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press .
[35:43] Speaker_B | Yep .
[35:44] Speaker_A | Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work .
[35:47] Speaker_D | Light only button user ca user interaction .
[35:47] Speaker_B | Oh no it's it's okay .
[35:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:53] Speaker_A | That's included . Yeah okay .
[35:56] Speaker_C | figure .
[36:02] Speaker_C | I'm not so good at drawing .
[36:05] Speaker_C | Excuse me ?
"[36:06] Speaker_D | Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable ."
[36:14] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[36:17] Speaker_C | No uh uh .
[36:19] Speaker_D | Maybe you should draw it very large like this .
[36:21] Speaker_B | Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly .
[36:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[36:24] Speaker_A | Sensitive .
[36:24] Speaker_D | Oh right .
[36:26] Speaker_C | How do we uh uh or insert text ?
[36:28] Speaker_D | Erase ?
[36:34] Speaker_A | I dunno . Maybe just start typing .
[36:41] Speaker_C | Oh that's a bit big . Yeah .
[36:48] Speaker_A | You also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view .
[36:52] Speaker_C | Yeah . Ex exactly .
"[36:55] Speaker_B | L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view ."
[37:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:08] Speaker_A | Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . Yeah .
"[37:10] Speaker_D | Much easier , yeah ."
[37:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:13] Speaker_B | The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand .
[37:14] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[37:26] Speaker_B | Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display ."
[37:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:36] Speaker_B | The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah .
[37:36] Speaker_C | The th
[37:38] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[37:42] Speaker_C | Oh . This is hard . What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ?
[37:47] Speaker_B | No it's it's uh it's okay .
[37:49] Speaker_C | Wait . Let me try it one more time .
[37:52] Speaker_C | Maybe I've uh it's easier if I draw it in once .
[38:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[38:15] Speaker_C | This'll take forever .
"[38:18] Speaker_C | It's fun to work with this pen . Um so , larger ."
[38:25] Speaker_D | Oh . Wrong one .
[38:27] Speaker_B | Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah .
[38:27] Speaker_C | And yeah . So side .
[38:35] Speaker_A | Five minutes left before the meeting ends .
[38:37] Speaker_C | 'Kay . Um other views ?
[38:40] Speaker_D | Alright .
[38:42] Speaker_B | Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit .
[38:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[38:49] Speaker_B | That's the question .
[38:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[38:56] Speaker_D | I is it if if this is from the side woah . Steady . Because there the screen goes up like that right ? So then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ?"
[38:57] Speaker_C | uh from yeah yeah . Sorry .
[39:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[39:07] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
[39:16] Speaker_C | The the idea is that it has to flip up to here .
[39:19] Speaker_B | May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble .
[39:26] Speaker_C | Okay .
[39:26] Speaker_B | Because it do doesn't have to flip then .
[39:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah .
"[39:34] Speaker_D | It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this ."
[39:35] Speaker_C | True .
[39:47] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[39:49] Speaker_D | Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism .
[39:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[39:54] Speaker_C | Think so .
[39:55] Speaker_A | Yeah we keep the flip ?
[39:57] Speaker_C | Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno .
[39:57] Speaker_A | Keep the flip live .
[40:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[40:06] Speaker_B | Uh the the shape is okay but yeah ?
[40:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[40:22] Speaker_B | Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button ."
[40:29] Speaker_D | Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? And then like i oh th doh .
[40:31] Speaker_B | Yeah and then h we sh mm .
"[40:47] Speaker_D | Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . So there's a layer of rubber on the side . So no flipping but just no ."
[40:55] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely .
[40:59] Speaker_A | No flipping ?
[41:01] Speaker_C | Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ?
[41:10] Speaker_D | Throwing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually .
[41:10] Speaker_A | It's shaking .
[41:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[41:12] Speaker_C | Yeah true true .
[41:15] Speaker_A | Yeah just light on top .
[41:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:19] Speaker_A | Safer .
[41:20] Speaker_A | Mm . Yeah okay that the target group .
"[41:21] Speaker_D | Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes ."
[41:24] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . That's true .
[41:28] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah ?
[41:30] Speaker_A | Well . I just uh ended the meeting . You two go design .
[41:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah .
[41:34] Speaker_B | Okay wi
[41:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[41:41] Speaker_A | I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote .
[41:44] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[41:44] Speaker_C | Oh right .
[41:48] Speaker_C | Alright .
[41:51] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright .
[41:54] Speaker_C | Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go .
[41:57] Speaker_D | Good .
[41:57] Speaker_A | So maybe you can include that somewhere .
[41:59] Speaker_D | Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ?
[42:01] Speaker_C | Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well .
[42:06] Speaker_C | Let's see .
[42:06] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yes .
[42:08] Speaker_C | What the hell's that ?
[42:09] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[42:14] Speaker_B | Yep .
[42:16] Speaker_B | Okay that's the side .
[42:18] Speaker_B | Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ?
[42:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think we do .
"[42:27] Speaker_B | Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button ."
[42:33] Speaker_C | Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . Yeah ?
"[42:42] Speaker_B | Yeah . No , yeah ."
"[42:44] Speaker_C | Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons ."
[42:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[42:58] Speaker_C | I think .
[42:59] Speaker_B | Mm .

[01:01] Speaker_D | Great man . Who starts ?
"[01:04] Speaker_A | Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting ."
"[01:06] Speaker_D | Alright , great ."
[01:10] Speaker_D | Alright .
[01:16] Speaker_A | I've put some uh new things in the in the map .
[01:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:23] Speaker_A | This is it .
"[01:25] Speaker_A | I don't know the shortcut , so Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it ."
[01:33] Speaker_C | Mm .
[01:37] Speaker_D | Yes .
[01:50] Speaker_A | Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you .
[01:57] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[01:57] Speaker_A | I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?"
"[01:59] Speaker_C | Well , yeah ."
[02:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[02:12] Speaker_A | Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh"
[02:16] Speaker_C | Oh .
[02:16] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[02:23] Speaker_A | smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be ."
[02:28] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[02:43] Speaker_C | We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ?
"[02:45] Speaker_A | Uh yeah , I think so . Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet ."
[02:47] Speaker_C | Alright .
[02:54] Speaker_D | Alright .
[02:55] Speaker_A | Um now I'll look at show this board .
"[03:06] Speaker_A | Well uh notes , first meeting ."
[03:11] Speaker_A | Now .
[03:12] Speaker_A | I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So
[03:22] Speaker_A | we said that uh
"[03:24] Speaker_A | we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television ."
[03:28] Speaker_D | Right .
[03:36] Speaker_C | Huh ?
"[03:50] Speaker_A | Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar ."
"[04:03] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , now it's right ."
[04:13] Speaker_A | It should be uh recognisable at all times . Yes . Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
[04:16] Speaker_B | Mm .
[04:16] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[04:21] Speaker_A | And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it ."
[04:30] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[04:35] Speaker_A | Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail"
"[04:41] Speaker_A | from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext ."
[04:46] Speaker_B | Oh .
[04:48] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[04:49] Speaker_C | I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess ."
[04:54] Speaker_A | the second is a bit
"[04:58] Speaker_A | sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project ."
[05:00] Speaker_B | Oh .
[05:03] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[05:05] Speaker_C | Oh , alright ."
"[05:06] Speaker_B | Oh , that's a shame ."
"[05:07] Speaker_A | So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years ."
[05:16] Speaker_A | Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .
[05:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:28] Speaker_D | But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on ."
[05:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[05:32] Speaker_A | Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company ."
[05:50] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[05:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , we are a real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course ."
[06:02] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[06:03] Speaker_D | Mm .
[06:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:13] Speaker_A | Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics ."
[06:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:23] Speaker_D | Right .
[06:23] Speaker_A | So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . You want to start ? Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . Well s then start .
[06:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[06:33] Speaker_D | Yeah . I think I have to start . Oh no , no problem . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry ."
[06:39] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:46] Speaker_D | I think it's this one .
[06:49] Speaker_D | But I'm not sure .
[07:00] Speaker_D | Hmm ? Yeah . S
[07:03] Speaker_D | Right .
"[07:05] Speaker_D | Yes . This is it . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ?"
[07:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[07:17] Speaker_D | Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use ."
"[07:48] Speaker_D | Well , um the first findings are that people um"
[07:54] Speaker_D | think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
"[08:08] Speaker_D | They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control ."
"[08:33] Speaker_D | well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy ."
"[08:55] Speaker_D | Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Yeah , yeah right ."
[09:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:13] Speaker_D | Right .
[09:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:33] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[09:40] Speaker_A | It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . No you can click it on your television ."
[09:53] Speaker_D | Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ?
[09:57] Speaker_D | Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
[10:03] Speaker_D | Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room .
[10:09] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[10:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:12] Speaker_D | Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
"[10:12] Speaker_A | Well we'll have a look at it , yeah ."
[10:37] Speaker_D | Yeah but people don't read manuals .
"[10:38] Speaker_C | I didn't read it ? Oh , alright . users to uh add one ? Do you think ?"
[10:40] Speaker_D | No .
[10:40] Speaker_B | No .
"[10:44] Speaker_D | I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual ."
[10:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright .
[10:51] Speaker_A | Yep .
[10:55] Speaker_D | Yeah . Right .
"[10:56] Speaker_A | Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short ."
[10:57] Speaker_D | And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
"[10:58] Speaker_B | Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think ."
[11:03] Speaker_A | Yes okay .
[11:04] Speaker_C | Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?
[11:04] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[11:14] Speaker_D | And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think ."
"[11:22] Speaker_A | Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point ."
[11:23] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[11:26] Speaker_D | Yeah right , right ."
[11:29] Speaker_A | Well we'll have a look . Um yes ?
[11:44] Speaker_C | Consider the m
[11:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[11:50] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[12:20] Speaker_D | I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs ."
[12:36] Speaker_C | It's going to be expensive . Yeah .
[12:37] Speaker_B | No .
[12:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:52] Speaker_C | Well we'll uh consider it uh .
"[13:00] Speaker_C | No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ?"
[13:09] Speaker_B | I think that's uh difficult to realise also .
[13:15] Speaker_D | it it might be important for the sale .
[13:17] Speaker_C | We have very demanding clients .
[13:20] Speaker_B | No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think .
[13:22] Speaker_D | Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens .
[13:22] Speaker_A | We sh
[13:26] Speaker_A | Yeah absolutely .
[13:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . We don't rule them out uh yet ."
[13:35] Speaker_D | Alright .
[13:35] Speaker_A | Yep .
[13:38] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[13:41] Speaker_A | Alright .
[13:43] Speaker_D | I think
[13:45] Speaker_D | it is sensible
[13:48] Speaker_D | to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can Right .
[13:51] Speaker_A | Yes .
[13:54] Speaker_A | Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation .
[13:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . Right .
[14:02] Speaker_C | Shall I give a technical talk ? Alright .
[14:03] Speaker_B | Oh you go .
[14:04] Speaker_A | Yes . Well go ahead .
[14:09] Speaker_C | Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .
[14:16] Speaker_A | Yip .
[14:21] Speaker_A | F_ five .
[14:38] Speaker_D | Oh right .
[14:41] Speaker_D | Purple .
"[14:43] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit ."
[14:52] Speaker_D | Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts .
[14:56] Speaker_C | And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page .
"[15:02] Speaker_C | Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set ."
"[15:03] Speaker_B | Yeah , go ahead ."
[15:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:26] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[15:27] Speaker_C | And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Very basic ."
[15:46] Speaker_A | Yep .
[15:49] Speaker_C | Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed .
"[16:05] Speaker_C | The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . So well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course ."
"[16:29] Speaker_C | Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task ."
[16:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:09] Speaker_C | This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um"
"[17:26] Speaker_C | uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Yeah ."
[17:43] Speaker_D | Right .
"[17:44] Speaker_D | Can I say something ? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences ."
[17:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[18:11] Speaker_D | Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press ."
"[18:14] Speaker_A | Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ ."
[18:14] Speaker_C | You don't have to look and and search for them .
[18:16] Speaker_D | Right .
"[18:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , right . Right ."
"[18:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . We"
"[18:32] Speaker_C | Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course ."
[18:35] Speaker_A | No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would
[18:42] Speaker_A | reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .
"[18:43] Speaker_B | Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ?"
[18:52] Speaker_A | Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .
"[18:54] Speaker_D | But is that is that useable ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?"
"[19:03] Speaker_D | It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it ."
[19:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:09] Speaker_B | Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . Eighty per cent would ."
"[19:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . That's very irritating , I think . Well . No ."
"[19:14] Speaker_C | Well , ."
"[19:20] Speaker_D | Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah , that's right . Yeah ."
[19:22] Speaker_B | Yeah that's true .
"[19:26] Speaker_C | But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time ."
"[19:44] Speaker_C | Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you ."
[19:45] Speaker_A | Yep .
[19:51] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[19:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right ."
"[19:55] Speaker_C | So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh"
[19:59] Speaker_A | Yep .
[20:05] Speaker_D | Alright .
[20:11] Speaker_C | don't look at it please . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . That's the most important thing .
[20:12] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[20:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's clear ."
[20:17] Speaker_A | Nice .
[20:18] Speaker_A | Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .
[20:24] Speaker_C | Right .
[20:30] Speaker_A | Wha Yeah .
[20:30] Speaker_D | About twenty minutes ago ?
"[20:33] Speaker_A | Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on ."
[20:41] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[20:45] Speaker_B | Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but"
[20:50] Speaker_D | I don't think so .
[20:51] Speaker_B | obviously that's not the case .
"[20:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links . Yeah ."
[20:57] Speaker_A | Oh yeah ?
[20:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:58] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[20:59] Speaker_A | Uh ?
"[21:06] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer ."
[21:09] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[21:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:22] Speaker_D | These are already in use ?
"[21:27] Speaker_D | Alright , okay ."
"[21:30] Speaker_B | This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . This one is user-centred ."
[21:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:37] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[21:38] Speaker_D | Well Yeah , me too ."
[21:38] Speaker_A | I like user-centred . Yeah .
[21:40] Speaker_B | I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best .
[21:44] Speaker_A | We also do that .
"[21:47] Speaker_B | Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff ."
[21:56] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[22:03] Speaker_D | But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?"
[22:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:11] Speaker_D | Alright .
[22:13] Speaker_B | I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .
"[22:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , right ."
[22:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:30] Speaker_C | Uh you can draw it if you Yeah .
[22:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[22:40] Speaker_A | Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh"
[22:50] Speaker_A | make someone w
"[22:53] Speaker_A | No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone ."
[23:02] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[23:04] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right ."
"[23:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's a must . We must have that ."
[23:10] Speaker_C | We can put it on the on the back side .
[23:14] Speaker_B | S something like this . It's recognisable .
[23:15] Speaker_A | Yes .
[23:17] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[23:18] Speaker_D | We can make a symbol of the company right here . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah ."
[23:21] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
"[23:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah ."
"[23:24] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah . Something like that , in the Yeah ."
[23:24] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah yeah . Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . Those kind of things . Yes . Okay .
[23:29] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[23:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:42] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[23:44] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[23:53] Speaker_C | Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?"
[24:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
[24:06] Speaker_B | We should go with that concept I think .
[24:10] Speaker_B | I know .
[24:10] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[24:10] Speaker_D | I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people ."
[24:12] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[24:18] Speaker_B | Mm .
[24:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[24:39] Speaker_A | Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do ."
[24:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:06] Speaker_D | Clip aren't used much .
[25:11] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[25:16] Speaker_D | Yeah but Yeah .
"[25:18] Speaker_D | Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control ."
"[25:26] Speaker_D | Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . The concurrent ? Competitors , right . So , I do think we have to uh have some features ."
[25:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Uh .
[25:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah .
"[25:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Yeah ."
[25:47] Speaker_D | Even though they cost a little more .
[25:55] Speaker_D | Right . Right .
[26:03] Speaker_D | Like a ticker-tape . Which programme you are l watching or something .
"[26:07] Speaker_A | Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s ."
"[26:14] Speaker_A | And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching ."
"[26:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , right . Yeah right ."
[26:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:33] Speaker_A | For example .
[26:35] Speaker_A | It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
[26:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[26:44] Speaker_D | No not clickable . Nah , no no no . Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top ."
[26:45] Speaker_A | Well maybe .
[26:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[26:59] Speaker_D | Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea .
[26:59] Speaker_A | R_D_S_s or something .
"[27:02] Speaker_C | But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing ."
[27:10] Speaker_B | Wa Yeah .
"[27:18] Speaker_D | Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . So I don't think that's the issue ."
[27:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:23] Speaker_A | No .
[27:23] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[27:24] Speaker_D | Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?"
[27:28] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[27:33] Speaker_A | We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that .
[27:34] Speaker_B | Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah .
[27:37] Speaker_D | Next time . Yeah right .
"[27:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , I understand what you're saying ."
[27:58] Speaker_D | We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .
"[28:04] Speaker_A | I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions ."
[28:14] Speaker_D | Right .
[28:14] Speaker_A | So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special .
[28:17] Speaker_D | At the top .
[28:21] Speaker_B | At the top or at the bottom ?
[28:22] Speaker_A | Yes .
[28:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:27] Speaker_D | When you s How do you zap ? You just sit in your chair ?
[28:31] Speaker_C | Huh ?
[28:32] Speaker_D | With the remote ?
[28:34] Speaker_A | That thing is terrible .
"[28:40] Speaker_D | Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Yeah , I dunno ."
"[28:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , no Mm ."
"[28:51] Speaker_D | No Um he thinks Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top ."
[29:01] Speaker_C | Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?
"[29:04] Speaker_B | Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . I c"
"[29:13] Speaker_C | But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface ."
[29:23] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
"[29:24] Speaker_A | Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . So and and I I like to use the ones"
[29:27] Speaker_B | Yeah . Power button always Yeah .
[29:33] Speaker_C | Bottom .
[29:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:35] Speaker_B | Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah ."
"[29:40] Speaker_C | Well that's a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you ."
[29:41] Speaker_D | We're making a remote with with a few functions you know . We
"[29:46] Speaker_C | It's it's also more recognisable . It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the"
[29:56] Speaker_B | Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote .
[30:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[30:13] Speaker_C | I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh"
[30:14] Speaker_D | Width .
[30:14] Speaker_A | Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ?
[30:18] Speaker_C | it's more familiar that way .
[30:19] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[30:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's off ."
[30:33] Speaker_D | Where ?
[30:34] Speaker_A | It's special pen .
[30:37] Speaker_A | Yeah . No .
"[30:41] Speaker_D | I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand ."
[30:48] Speaker_C | Yeah . I I agree .
"[30:50] Speaker_A | I think it should be at the button , bottom ."
"[30:52] Speaker_B | At the bottom ? In a few minutes Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah ."
[30:52] Speaker_A | Bottom . The L_C_D_ .
[30:54] Speaker_D | At the bot
[30:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:59] Speaker_A | Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . Because we have to decide this ."
[31:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:04] Speaker_D | Right . Great .
"[31:05] Speaker_C | Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button ."
[31:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:17] Speaker_A | Yes .
[31:19] Speaker_C | Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh
"[31:22] Speaker_C | While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . Yeah ."
"[31:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , right ."
"[31:25] Speaker_D | Alright , let's keep it central ."
"[31:31] Speaker_C | Channel , yeah ."
[31:34] Speaker_B | Volume ?
[31:34] Speaker_C | Volume control .
[31:35] Speaker_A | Yes .
[31:41] Speaker_D | Mm .
[31:42] Speaker_A | Uh the mute button . I h love that one .
[31:47] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
"[31:55] Speaker_B | The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ?"
[31:57] Speaker_A | Yes .
[31:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design .
[32:00] Speaker_B | And and a volume control also in it .
[32:03] Speaker_A | Yes .
[32:05] Speaker_D | Right .
[32:08] Speaker_A | Well h ho
"[32:16] Speaker_D | You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance ."
[32:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:23] Speaker_B | I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
"[32:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_"
"[32:29] Speaker_D | was t kinda true . When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other ."
[32:50] Speaker_A | Apart .
[32:52] Speaker_A | So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ .
"[32:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . Y Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah ."
"[33:02] Speaker_A | That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place ."
[33:06] Speaker_B | Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . They they need to be centred .
[33:06] Speaker_A | Yes ?
[33:10] Speaker_C | No but now y W would we have to choose a
"[33:14] Speaker_D | Frequency of uh button use . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down ."
[33:15] Speaker_C | way in middle ?
[33:16] Speaker_A | Yes .
[33:22] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[33:32] Speaker_B | No I don't think .
[33:33] Speaker_A | Up and down far apart from each other ?
"[33:48] Speaker_C | I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together ."
"[33:54] Speaker_A | Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone But the buttons is way . So that one can be put away ."
[34:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Right .
[34:10] Speaker_D | Yeah . I agree .
[34:16] Speaker_D | And should and should be red .
[34:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , well five minutes left . Yep ."
"[34:22] Speaker_D | Right , just make some decisions ."
[34:28] Speaker_A | Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
"[34:29] Speaker_C | C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing ."
[34:34] Speaker_A | Well I have it here .
"[34:38] Speaker_D | I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready ."
[34:38] Speaker_A | Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . Yes .
[34:41] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[34:43] Speaker_C | Mm . Alright .
[34:44] Speaker_A | Yes .
[34:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:06] Speaker_A | Yes .
[35:08] Speaker_D | Top or bottom ?
[35:13] Speaker_A | Yes it is .
"[35:18] Speaker_A | Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?"
[35:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[35:25] Speaker_A | Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
[35:25] Speaker_C | Yeah d
"[35:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , right . Okay ."
[35:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:28] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[35:29] Speaker_A | Alright these functions . The number f Well yes , that's alright . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?"
"[35:30] Speaker_C | As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . So that's"
"[35:33] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[35:35] Speaker_C | that's enough . Yeah .
[35:43] Speaker_B | No .
[35:45] Speaker_A | How do you want it to do then ?
[35:47] Speaker_C | There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
[35:48] Speaker_A | It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
"[35:53] Speaker_B | No , if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ."
[35:58] Speaker_A | Yes .
[35:58] Speaker_C | They'd recognise it . Th that's the most That that's very easy . Yeah .
[36:00] Speaker_A | Alright so no button for that .
[36:02] Speaker_D | No .
[36:04] Speaker_A | Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?
[36:10] Speaker_C | I think these are the the most important functions .
[36:12] Speaker_D | Do you still have the pictures over there ?
[36:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[36:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's about it ."
"[36:35] Speaker_D | Alright , alright uh Now okay ."
[36:46] Speaker_D | Right .
"[36:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's most useable this way ."
[36:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[36:55] Speaker_A | Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing .
[37:06] Speaker_A | And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
[37:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:16] Speaker_D | Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
[37:17] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
"[37:20] Speaker_A | Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ?"
[37:24] Speaker_A | Th that's a bit uh waste .
[37:24] Speaker_B | We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .
[37:28] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[37:29] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay , right ."
[37:32] Speaker_B | Or at Yeah alright then .
[37:38] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[37:43] Speaker_B | Oh , they can be small or round like buttons ."
[37:45] Speaker_C | Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .
"[37:53] Speaker_C | Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Above or down ?"
[37:56] Speaker_A | Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
"[38:00] Speaker_C | And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah ."
[38:10] Speaker_B | Why go to video ?
"[38:12] Speaker_A | Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ ."
[38:17] Speaker_C | The the video channel uh ?
[38:18] Speaker_B | That's just zero . Yeah .
[38:21] Speaker_C | No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .
[38:21] Speaker_A | Well l n no not at not at my remote .
[38:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[38:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ ."
[38:28] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[38:29] Speaker_B | Yes , I think th"
"[38:31] Speaker_B | No , then you press ninety nine . I think go to video is"
"[38:32] Speaker_D | Ah uh well whatever , ."
[38:35] Speaker_A | Th that's the button uh No .
"[38:37] Speaker_C | But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button ."
[39:01] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[39:04] Speaker_A | These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote ."
"[39:09] Speaker_C | Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width ."
[39:09] Speaker_B | Yeah well y you must have .
[39:21] Speaker_D | Right . That's the only one we put uh in there .
[39:26] Speaker_A | So we still have one uh four ?
[39:28] Speaker_D | For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .
[39:30] Speaker_A | Ch ch
[39:32] Speaker_C | Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .
"[39:34] Speaker_D | Programme , right ."
"[39:35] Speaker_A | Okay . Oh the Okay button ? Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Menu button ."
[39:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[39:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , alright ."
[39:45] Speaker_C | You should Yeah . I think that's important . Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .

"[40:05] Speaker_C | Where ? I don't see it . Oh Menu , alright ."
[40:08] Speaker_A | Here .
"[40:09] Speaker_B | I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah ."
"[40:13] Speaker_C | In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah ."
[40:19] Speaker_A | Alright .
[40:20] Speaker_B | Or the volume or something like that .

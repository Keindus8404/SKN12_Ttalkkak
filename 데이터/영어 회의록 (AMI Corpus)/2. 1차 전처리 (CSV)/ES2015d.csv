[00:58] Speaker_A | Okay . Here we go .
"[01:04] Speaker_A | Alright , the agenda for thi oh ."
"[01:07] Speaker_A | Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave"
[01:43] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:45] Speaker_A | So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?
"[01:50] Speaker_B | Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them ."
[01:52] Speaker_A | Alright .
[01:55] Speaker_B | Thank you .
"[02:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , here we are ."
[02:18] Speaker_A | On ? A mango . Okay .
[02:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the
"[02:27] Speaker_C | infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah ."
[02:28] Speaker_B | The L_E_D_ .
[02:32] Speaker_A | Oh . Okay .
[02:34] Speaker_D | I'm sorry . What was the where's the L_E_D_ ?
[02:34] Speaker_A | Oops .
[02:36] Speaker_C | It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be
[02:37] Speaker_D | Oh . Okay .
[02:45] Speaker_B | So it's palm-held .
[02:45] Speaker_C | accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the
[02:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[02:51] Speaker_C | buttons are accessible from your thumb .
[02:53] Speaker_A | Notice you have a number ten button .
"[02:56] Speaker_C | Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? Right no , that's a zero . Take that one off ."
[03:11] Speaker_C | And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
"[03:15] Speaker_C | thirt the plus . You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah ."
[03:20] Speaker_A | Oh . You press a plus button ?
[03:23] Speaker_A | Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .
"[03:34] Speaker_B | Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two ."
[03:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[03:49] Speaker_D | Oh , there's no e okay ."
[03:50] Speaker_C | So the plus and then yeah .
[03:50] Speaker_A | Oh .
[03:53] Speaker_D | Okay .
[03:56] Speaker_A | Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?
"[03:59] Speaker_C | No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um"
"[04:08] Speaker_A | Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards ."
[04:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:15] Speaker_C | Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine ."
"[04:20] Speaker_A | Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?"
[04:23] Speaker_D | Sixty .
[04:25] Speaker_C | You p
[04:29] Speaker_C | Oh .
[04:33] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[04:40] Speaker_B | Well I don't mind , we can further define that ."
[04:43] Speaker_A | I th
"[04:46] Speaker_B | I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five ."
[04:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:51] Speaker_A | Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .
[04:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:52] Speaker_B | But I suppose it's not as snappy .
[04:54] Speaker_D | Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . So as long as you hit them dada
[04:56] Speaker_C | Oops .
[04:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:02] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , that yeah ."
[05:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:08] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:15] Speaker_C | A channel .
[05:16] Speaker_D | Channel up volume up . Okay cool .
[05:18] Speaker_A | C_ and V_ .
"[05:20] Speaker_A | Right , where um where's the power button ?"
[05:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:23] Speaker_D | It's the R_ .
[05:23] Speaker_B | It's the bigger R_ .
[05:25] Speaker_A | Oh okay .
[05:26] Speaker_B | So it's just like . We deci
"[05:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote ."
[05:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:33] Speaker_B | Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Yeah .
[05:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[05:45] Speaker_A | Oh okay .
[05:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[05:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic ."
"[05:53] Speaker_B | It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? How it fits in the palm of your hand ?"
[05:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:06] Speaker_A | The spon yeah .
[06:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel .
[06:24] Speaker_A | Yes . I would .
"[06:39] Speaker_B | Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination ."
[06:42] Speaker_C | Of Play Doh yeah .
"[06:58] Speaker_B | Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish ."
[07:08] Speaker_A | Oh right .
[07:20] Speaker_A | Think like vanilla and banana would .
"[07:23] Speaker_B | Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black ."
[07:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:28] Speaker_A | Okay yeah .
"[07:29] Speaker_B | So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal ."
"[07:35] Speaker_A | Kinda Christmas , you know ."
[07:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:44] Speaker_C | The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor ."
[07:48] Speaker_A | Cool .
[07:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:58] Speaker_B | Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb ."
[08:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:16] Speaker_B | Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it ."
"[08:22] Speaker_A | Alright , thank you very much . Good work everyone ."
"[08:28] Speaker_A | Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . So , I have"
[08:38] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[08:46] Speaker_A | Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ?
[08:50] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .
[08:54] Speaker_A | What time is it anyw
[08:56] Speaker_A | Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Yeah .
[08:56] Speaker_D | Evaluation cri Okay . That's me .
[09:05] Speaker_D | Hello .
[09:07] Speaker_D | Oh there we go .
[09:28] Speaker_D | Okay . Come on my computer . Come on .
[09:38] Speaker_A | Just press um function eight again .
[09:40] Speaker_D | Last time I did that it sh
[09:44] Speaker_D | Okay . You're right .
[09:46] Speaker_A | And then again I think .
[09:48] Speaker_A | One more time .
[09:49] Speaker_D | Oh . Still not there .
[09:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[10:01] Speaker_D | Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen ."
"[10:13] Speaker_D | Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do ."
[10:29] Speaker_D | Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
[10:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:56] Speaker_A | Ooh .
[10:57] Speaker_D | Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?
[11:03] Speaker_C | Mm .
[11:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:09] Speaker_A | The look is a little bit more playful .
[11:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:13] Speaker_D | Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional yeah ."
[11:16] Speaker_A | Oh definitely different yeah .
[11:22] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[11:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:34] Speaker_A | Oh you were only given red and black ?
[11:37] Speaker_A | Oh okay .
"[11:37] Speaker_C | Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway ."
[11:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:58] Speaker_C | Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .
[11:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:07] Speaker_D | Yeah . I kinda I like the potato look . It's very different . It's what ? Oh sorry the mango the mango look . Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood ."
[12:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .
[12:20] Speaker_D | So I myself would say a one or a two .
[12:22] Speaker_A | Yeah . I would say two . Personally .
[12:24] Speaker_D | It's a two ?
[12:24] Speaker_C | I w I'd say two I think .
"[12:26] Speaker_D | Okay , and p"
[12:26] Speaker_B | For the
[12:27] Speaker_C | Fanciness .
[12:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:32] Speaker_D | Two . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative ."
[12:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_B | Yeah and the use of the rubber .
"[12:49] Speaker_D | Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ ."
[12:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:50] Speaker_B | For the anti-R_S_I_ .
[12:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:53] Speaker_B | The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . In some aspects it is , like we said ."
[12:57] Speaker_C | Mm .
[13:03] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:09] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'd say maybe three .
[13:11] Speaker_C | I'll go for three as well .
"[13:11] Speaker_D | Yeah . And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal ."
[13:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . Though it was our specification .
"[13:17] Speaker_C | No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah ."
[13:17] Speaker_A | Yeah we want it simple .
[13:23] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:29] Speaker_A | I think so . Yeah .
[13:30] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[13:30] Speaker_C | Yeah very . I think one for that . Yeah . No .
[13:31] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . S
"[13:33] Speaker_D | Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . But once that's figured out , it should be fine ."
[13:34] Speaker_A | Yeah . One .
[13:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:39] Speaker_A | The plus number thing .
[13:40] Speaker_C | Yeah that's the only thing yeah .
[13:44] Speaker_D | Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
[13:45] Speaker_B | Mm .
[13:50] Speaker_B | Again I think the colour comes into this .
[13:52] Speaker_A | Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .
[13:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:55] Speaker_A | I think that the logo could be smaller .
[13:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[13:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:59] Speaker_A | And maybe not such a prominent way . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of ."
[14:04] Speaker_C | Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
[14:08] Speaker_D | Whoops .
[14:08] Speaker_A | Oh it just had to be on there I guess .
[14:09] Speaker_D | Should just not touch it . This time it's the three I killed . I was just wondering if it should be like flatter .
[14:21] Speaker_B | I suppose I've got quite big hands .
[14:22] Speaker_A | I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
[14:25] Speaker_C | Yeah . But you know what I've just thought of there now . What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?
"[14:32] Speaker_A | Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like"
[14:34] Speaker_D | Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
[14:35] Speaker_C | Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .
[14:37] Speaker_A | round .
[14:39] Speaker_D | Oh . That's true .
[14:40] Speaker_A | It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .
"[14:42] Speaker_B | Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly ."
"[14:42] Speaker_D | Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Like that ."
[14:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:50] Speaker_A | Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .
"[14:52] Speaker_B | Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha ."
[14:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:53] Speaker_D | I g
[14:57] Speaker_B | H it's got higher centre of gravity like that .
"[15:03] Speaker_C | Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes ."
[15:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:09] Speaker_A | I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two ."
[15:14] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
"[15:16] Speaker_B | I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours ."
[15:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:24] Speaker_D | Okay , so should we say two for that ? Yeah ?"
[15:27] Speaker_A | Sure .
[15:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:29] Speaker_D | Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy ."
"[15:41] Speaker_C | I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it ."
[15:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[15:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:52] Speaker_D | Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .
[15:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:07] Speaker_C | Oh no the plus . You're use the zero . Make a new one .
"[16:09] Speaker_D | No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ?"
"[16:16] Speaker_C | I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?"
[16:22] Speaker_D | But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . So we'll market it that way too .
[16:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:25] Speaker_B | Mm , yeah , that's true ."
[16:25] Speaker_A | Oh . Exactly . Exactly .
[16:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . Good point .
[16:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . I would give it a two still though .
[16:34] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[16:35] Speaker_C | Mm .
[16:44] Speaker_A | Mm .
[16:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:46] Speaker_C | I think it does very well .
[16:47] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
"[16:48] Speaker_B | Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . And it's just you won't have to think about it . You don't have to look down to find them . They're clearly there , easy to use . Simple ."
[16:53] Speaker_C | The zap yeah .
[16:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[16:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:02] Speaker_D | Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . But they're not you and I really . So . Okay so one ? Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?"
[17:07] Speaker_B | Yeah . Mm .
[17:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:21] Speaker_A | We have the alarm system .
"[17:29] Speaker_B | Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm ."
[17:38] Speaker_C | It'll be again in the marketing .
[17:39] Speaker_A | I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .
[17:41] Speaker_C | Yeah . The light it will .
[17:43] Speaker_A | Or or was it gonna make a noise ?
[17:47] Speaker_A | You press the button it makes a noise right ?
[17:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . Awesome . Awesome .
"[17:55] Speaker_B | Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up ."
[18:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:08] Speaker_C | It would have to be in the market
[18:09] Speaker_A | I though w it was gonna make a noise .
[18:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself ."
[18:11] Speaker_C | Yeah but you still couldn't see it .
[18:15] Speaker_C | It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
[18:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Sorry .
[18:21] Speaker_A | Oh okay . Whoo . Okay .
"[18:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , totally ."
[18:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear .
"[18:30] Speaker_A | No problem , mm ."
"[18:31] Speaker_D | Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on ."
[18:38] Speaker_A | Totally .
"[18:39] Speaker_C | So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?"
[18:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:46] Speaker_B | Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use ."
[18:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:54] Speaker_D | Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .
"[19:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter ."
[19:04] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:07] Speaker_A | Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .
"[19:08] Speaker_D | You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah ."
[19:09] Speaker_C | Oh okay . Right .
"[19:10] Speaker_A | And then like twelve , enter ."
"[19:10] Speaker_B | And or sixty six enter , y"
"[19:12] Speaker_C | Alright , aye ."
[19:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:18] Speaker_D | Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? Okay ."
[19:21] Speaker_C | I'd say w yeah one . Yeah .
[19:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:24] Speaker_B | Ooh . Mm .
"[19:27] Speaker_D | Question number nine . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Um , which affected over a quarter of users ."
[19:27] Speaker_B | Oh .
[19:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:32] Speaker_B | Injury .
[19:40] Speaker_C | But if you're zapping yeah . I don't think it will f
"[19:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about ."
"[19:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , the biology ."
[19:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:49] Speaker_A | But it is soft .
[19:50] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[19:51] Speaker_A | And that's kind of what the um
[19:52] Speaker_C | Mm .
[19:54] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:01] Speaker_D | I don't know what other options there are .
[20:02] Speaker_B | I think we're getting that's true .
[20:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:05] Speaker_D | Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control ."
[20:09] Speaker_B | Mm .
[20:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .

[21:01] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think this is the
[21:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:04] Speaker_B | the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
[21:07] Speaker_D | Okay .

"[21:09] Speaker_A | Mm , yeah ."
[21:16] Speaker_D | Yeah . And the buttons in the middle .
[21:17] Speaker_C | That isn't rubber .

[27:56] Speaker_A | Pushed for creativity ?
"[27:57] Speaker_B | I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . So I think we could've done with a bit more time ."

[28:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:30] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . So that did limit"

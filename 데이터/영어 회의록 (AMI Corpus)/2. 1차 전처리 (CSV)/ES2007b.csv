[00:09] Speaker_B | Mm .
[00:09] Speaker_C | Right it was function F_ eight or something .
[00:13] Speaker_C | This one right there .
[00:17] Speaker_B | Okay . Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ?
[00:17] Speaker_C | Okay .
[00:22] Speaker_C | Huh .
[00:22] Speaker_B | You will as well ?
"[00:24] Speaker_C | Oh I thought we all were . Yeah , I have one too , okay ."
[00:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[00:45] Speaker_B | Yep .
[01:12] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[01:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea ."
[01:17] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:20] Speaker_B | I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_
[01:27] Speaker_B | I_N_E_ .
"[01:29] Speaker_A | Okay , and Gabriel ."
[01:33] Speaker_C | Uh Gabriel .
[01:38] Speaker_A | E_L_ is it ?
[01:39] Speaker_C | E_L_ .
[01:42] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[01:44] Speaker_D | I am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ .
"[01:50] Speaker_D | Double S_ A_ , yeah yeah . Sorry ."
[01:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[02:00] Speaker_A | 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . Uh , right ."
[02:03] Speaker_B | Right .
[02:05] Speaker_B | True .
[02:11] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay .
"[02:12] Speaker_A | Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to"
"[02:59] Speaker_A | wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . Um ."
[03:16] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[03:19] Speaker_A | Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it ."
[03:34] Speaker_B | How long is the meeting ?
"[03:35] Speaker_A | This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can ."
[03:40] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:22] Speaker_D | I'm fine . Yeah .
"[04:26] Speaker_D | I uh yeah , yeah . D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation ."
[04:27] Speaker_C | Think she's finishing up her presentation .
[04:33] Speaker_D | Uh I'm done . Okay .
"[04:34] Speaker_A | Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first ."
[04:43] Speaker_D | Mm .
[04:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:55] Speaker_B | Okay . Um just connecting this .
[05:13] Speaker_B | Are we getting i
[05:14] Speaker_A | You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go .
[05:26] Speaker_B | Uh .
[05:30] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[05:32] Speaker_B | So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've oh no , you can't see a thing . Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um the idea is that we've got the"
[05:48] Speaker_A | Ah .
"[05:57] Speaker_B | energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . Uh and then"
[06:14] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[06:26] Speaker_B | then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh"
"[06:39] Speaker_B | an infra-red signal ,"
[06:44] Speaker_B | um which will be sent by an electronic chip .
[06:54] Speaker_B | And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface .
[07:02] Speaker_B | So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .
[07:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:22] Speaker_B | Um and that's it really for the working design .
[07:28] Speaker_A | Great . Okay .
[07:35] Speaker_A | I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . Yeah .
[07:37] Speaker_B | Really ? Cool .
"[07:42] Speaker_A | Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?"
[07:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[07:50] Speaker_B | Or suggestions ?
[07:55] Speaker_D | Is a battery like
"[08:00] Speaker_B | Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s"
"[08:26] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know ."
[08:26] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah .
"[08:30] Speaker_C | One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream ."
[08:46] Speaker_A | How far away is your television ?
[08:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:49] Speaker_A | It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall ."
[09:01] Speaker_C | That's true .
"[09:08] Speaker_B | Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it ."
[09:16] Speaker_B | I didn't think about that
"[09:22] Speaker_D | Instead of using infra-red ,"
[09:24] Speaker_D | use Bluetooth .
[09:26] Speaker_B | Why not ?
[09:29] Speaker_D | Isn't that a better signal ?
[09:29] Speaker_B | I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it .
"[09:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . You know we don't need it ."
[09:36] Speaker_D | Mm .
[10:02] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[10:02] Speaker_B | Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i"
[10:09] Speaker_D | 'S just an idea .
[10:12] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:32] Speaker_A | Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things ."
[10:39] Speaker_C | Okay .
[10:42] Speaker_B | Do you need the border ?
[10:43] Speaker_C | Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .
[10:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:08] Speaker_C | Technical . Okay .
[11:31] Speaker_D | Adjusting .
"[11:31] Speaker_C | Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh ."
[11:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:35] Speaker_C | So I'm doing the user interface design .
[11:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[11:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at"
"[11:47] Speaker_C | looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there ."
[12:13] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[12:14] Speaker_C | Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that ,"
[12:18] Speaker_C | the basic functionality that people want .
"[12:22] Speaker_C | Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control ,"
"[12:29] Speaker_C | um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility ."
[12:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:56] Speaker_C | And so in the research that I was doing
"[12:59] Speaker_C | there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you uh ."
"[13:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um ."
[13:23] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[13:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:37] Speaker_A | Great .
"[13:51] Speaker_C | So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . So uh , yeah , that's me ."
[14:06] Speaker_D | Mm .
[14:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:37] Speaker_C | No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business .
[14:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:51] Speaker_C | I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality ."
"[14:55] Speaker_C | I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?"
[15:03] Speaker_A | I would say
"[15:11] Speaker_A | If it's simple to do ,"
"[15:14] Speaker_A | which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ ."
[15:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:22] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[15:25] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[15:32] Speaker_C | Right .
[15:56] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[15:57] Speaker_A | You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um ."
[16:04] Speaker_C | Right .
[16:05] Speaker_C | And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .
[16:07] Speaker_A | We put the fashion in electronics . There you go .
[16:08] Speaker_D | Mm .
[16:09] Speaker_C | I think I think we have to carry that mental .
"[16:11] Speaker_A | So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be ."
[16:18] Speaker_C | Mm .
[16:23] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[16:24] Speaker_C | Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean ."
[16:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Great .
"[16:35] Speaker_C | Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um ."
"[16:46] Speaker_A | Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby ."
[16:50] Speaker_D | Okay .
[16:55] Speaker_D | Where does it go into ?
[16:58] Speaker_D | Here ? The blue thing .
[16:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up ."
"[17:14] Speaker_D | Well , function F_ eight ."
"[17:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , it just takes a second uh ."
"[17:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while ."
[17:26] Speaker_D | Come on .
"[17:33] Speaker_D | Right . Okay . . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user ."
"[18:24] Speaker_D | So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't"
"[18:28] Speaker_D | like match how people behave . Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel ."
"[18:55] Speaker_D | Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like ."
[18:57] Speaker_A | I think that's k flicking quickly between channels .
"[19:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess ."
[19:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:21] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[20:00] Speaker_D | So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote ."
"[20:15] Speaker_A | So there you go , yeah ."
"[20:33] Speaker_C | No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah ."
"[20:44] Speaker_A | People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it ."
"[20:55] Speaker_A | Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent ."
"[21:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , that would be my guess as well ."
[21:14] Speaker_D | These guys are growing up .
[21:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:26] Speaker_A | I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .
[21:27] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[21:30] Speaker_D | Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense Huh ?"
[21:53] Speaker_A | So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .
[21:58] Speaker_D | Yeah maybe not so hard .
[21:59] Speaker_C | Mm .
[22:02] Speaker_C | Mm .
[22:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:12] Speaker_A | Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury ."
"[22:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh ."
[22:21] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[22:24] Speaker_A | Yeah . They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting ."
[22:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:34] Speaker_C | I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements ."
[22:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:40] Speaker_D | Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something ."
[22:44] Speaker_C | Mm .
[22:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:50] Speaker_A | Okay . That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . Um okay , so we've basically"
[22:50] Speaker_D | So that is me .
[23:03] Speaker_A | we've decide we've d
"[23:05] Speaker_A | we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . It's gotta be cheap . S um ."
[23:15] Speaker_D | Mm .
[23:21] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[23:23] Speaker_A | Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um ."
[24:11] Speaker_B | Yep .
[24:15] Speaker_A | I think we're all um pretty sussed on that .
[24:20] Speaker_A | anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ?
[24:24] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[24:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page ."
"[24:29] Speaker_A | Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?"
"[24:45] Speaker_D | Well , just questionnaires ."
[24:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , stuff . Um okay . Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?"
"[25:00] Speaker_D | Yeah , you can ."
[25:01] Speaker_A | Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ?
[25:02] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[25:05] Speaker_D | I think he's participant one , aren't you ?"
"[25:10] Speaker_C | Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah ."
[25:12] Speaker_A | Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?
"[25:17] Speaker_B | You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . You want to have friends , don't you ?"
"[25:21] Speaker_A | Send me , yeah yeah , okay ."
"[25:36] Speaker_C | Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves ."
"[25:41] Speaker_A | Okay . Well ,"
[25:44] Speaker_A | maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ?
[25:46] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[25:47] Speaker_D | Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ?"
[25:51] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[25:51] Speaker_A | Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product ."
"[25:59] Speaker_D | But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it ."
[26:00] Speaker_C | Mm .
[26:03] Speaker_A | There's loads of companies that called R_R_ .
[26:04] Speaker_C | Mm .
[26:06] Speaker_D | Whoa .
"[26:07] Speaker_A | This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type ."
"[26:10] Speaker_C | And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them ."
[26:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:16] Speaker_D | So we have to have it one colour .
"[26:17] Speaker_A | Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it ."
"[26:18] Speaker_C | Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable ."
[26:22] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[26:23] Speaker_A | Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps ."
[26:31] Speaker_D | Mm .
[26:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:56] Speaker_D | Mm .
[26:57] Speaker_B | If .
[26:57] Speaker_A | Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department .
"[27:03] Speaker_A | Mm okay . Well , well done everybody . And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now ."
"[27:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now ."
[27:14] Speaker_D | Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?
[27:16] Speaker_A | We might possibly have done .
[27:18] Speaker_B | Cool .
"[27:19] Speaker_C | Alright , see you all soon ."
[27:33] Speaker_D | 'Kay uh .
"[27:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , there you go ."

"[01:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , mine doesn't stick today either ."
"[01:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , seems slippery ."
[01:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[01:31] Speaker_D | What day is it ?
[01:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[01:48] Speaker_B | Who wants to write summary ?

"[01:53] Speaker_D | Um no . No , just the summary . No , that was just summary . No . Um no um okay ."
[01:58] Speaker_B | Oh .
[01:58] Speaker_B | I'll do it .
"[02:03] Speaker_D | Oh , write the sum okay , right ."
"[02:06] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[02:07] Speaker_B | Um have you changed the the file yet ?
[02:09] Speaker_D | I did I was trying to I didn't have privileges to get in to update your file . I w I actually meant to I meant to send the email and then I was just c didn't get around to it .
[02:15] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[02:15] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , I forgot that actually ."
"[02:19] Speaker_B | Yeah . No , when we um when you said at the beginning I thought must check the read-write and then I never did it ."
"[02:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , I had yeah , 'cause I forget mine as well , and it's just like , you know , every time put something in there . Um so yeah , I was j yeah . That was the main thing , so um as soon as that's in it'll be right out . I was making a couple of little change as well . So so those will be able to play with . Still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well . So that's that's sorta tonight as well . So Um yeah . Other than that it's sorta coming along . Um getting a better feel for all these NITE objects ."
[02:25] Speaker_B | No ? Alright .
[02:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:53] Speaker_B | Mm g yeah . Uh .
[03:14] Speaker_C | Seems unlikely .
[03:23] Speaker_B | There is a file in the directory called disful .
[03:28] Speaker_B | I ho what is it ?
[03:29] Speaker_D | I th
[03:29] Speaker_C | It's an Excel s S_X_ dot X_S_L_ .
[03:45] Speaker_D | Oh really ? Okay .
"[03:48] Speaker_B | Oh right . Yeah , that's right , yeah , yeah ."
[03:53] Speaker_B | Oh right . Well
[04:00] Speaker_D | No . G
"[04:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , I know it . Tons , tons . All those objects , yeah ."
[04:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . Shoulda run the I_L_ in that directory . Yeah .
"[04:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's uh it's about yeah , it's so I think there's about eight gigs on there . So yeah , it's no problem . It's just much bigger than all of our home directories combined , isn't it ? ."
"[04:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , something like that , yeah ."
"[04:36] Speaker_D | Yeah , exac exactly ."
[04:40] Speaker_D | Um I don't know . How's everything else going ?
[04:40] Speaker_A | Sounds good .
[04:42] Speaker_B | Has anyone had time to to play with it ?
"[04:45] Speaker_C | Yeah . I had a play with it um yesterday . Uh no , it was good really . Yeah , I liked it . Um"
[04:46] Speaker_A | Oh .
[04:48] Speaker_B | Any comments ?
"[05:01] Speaker_D | Do we wanna keep that ? Like are we keeping that how that happens ? It just prints everything out in the in the shell as well , like as it does everything , it just kinda I guess that's its default behaviour anyway . So it's just kinda doesn't really do anything . So , okay ."
[05:02] Speaker_B | Oh right .
"[05:10] Speaker_B | Might as well , yeah . I mean yeah . The thing is that , yeah , there is as I said a while ago , there is still this one error which is a bug in in N_X_T_ um that r r always generates these . I think when you when you left-click or right-click or something , I can't remember now ."
[05:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:28] Speaker_B | Um but if it's a real error , then it it stops , so you can't do any any more . Good . Good . Good ."
"[05:32] Speaker_C | Uh yeah , I didn't discover any of those , yeah . I did have a look . I prodded it to see if it'd break , but it didn't break too m I didn't play that long , but um it seemed alright really , yeah . And it the the th the start-up's great , looks quite good , looks alright . And so yeah , yeah ."
[05:35] Speaker_D | 'Kay . Right .
[05:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:47] Speaker_D | Yeah . I was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what I was doing , so I didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet . But uh I can do that . That's well , right after this , yeah ."
[05:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[05:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , be good . Is there any any comments you have about just like wording and or some sort of minor things ?"
[05:56] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'll do it .
[06:03] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[06:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[06:21] Speaker_D | If you if you ch if you change your window manager , it might look a little bit nicer . Just yeah . Oh yeah ? Okay , right ."
[06:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:36] Speaker_B | But that took me so long to do this bloody start window . Nasty . So I'm quite glad that it looks , you know , ni nice on one or this kind of thing ."
[06:41] Speaker_D | Oh yeah ? Okay .
[06:45] Speaker_D | Were you using like a GUI builder or just all from code ?
"[06:48] Speaker_B | No , this is just yeah ."
[06:54] Speaker_C | Well the um the um speaker characterisation is finished .
[06:58] Speaker_D | Oh yeah ? Wow . Okay .
[06:59] Speaker_B | Alright .
[07:00] Speaker_A | It's good .
"[07:11] Speaker_B | That's odd , yeah ."
"[07:14] Speaker_D | Well well can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there ? Just yeah . I don't know . I've done stuff like that before , it's insane , it's insane . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ."
"[07:38] Speaker_C | I saw that , yeah . I saw that it it doe it's tells tells you what speakers uh are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah , something like that , yeah ."
"[07:46] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah . But it's good , your your stuff is really coo good . It's got a good interface and easy to use . It's nice ."
[08:08] Speaker_D | Mm .
[08:16] Speaker_B | Right .
[08:20] Speaker_D | Right .
[08:20] Speaker_B | Well wouldn't won't we include that then ? Yeah .
[08:21] Speaker_A | Who ?
[08:22] Speaker_C | So I got rid of that . And then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back-channel . Well I don't know what that means . Who knows what back-channel .
[08:28] Speaker_D | What was it ?
[08:28] Speaker_A | What ?
"[08:29] Speaker_B | It's when they say mm , uh-huh , yeah ."
[08:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:35] Speaker_D | Well , it's kinda boring , yeah . Exactly ."
"[08:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . Some people don't though . There are some people who don't do that . Actually yeah , you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list . Yeah . I know . Some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time , yes no questions . Um uh what else comes up ?"
[08:40] Speaker_B | Really ?
"[08:55] Speaker_B | So which you know , suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list . Like three or four or something ."
[09:08] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[09:09] Speaker_D | Oh yeah , cool ."
[09:09] Speaker_B | Very nice .
[09:34] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[09:37] Speaker_D | Okay , right . Or I don't know , if we have like uh a choice , so they can filter those out f the the top most common , just say okay all show all or show , you know , only the im interesting ones ."
[09:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:50] Speaker_C | Dialogue acts per b
"[09:53] Speaker_D | Yeah . I don't know , yeah , it doesn't really matter . Well , if we just automatically filter these out ."
"[10:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker's got top a top whatever , and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker , and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts ."
[10:12] Speaker_D | They're boring . .
[10:21] Speaker_B | For the speaker . Yeah .
"[10:33] Speaker_B | No , I wouldn't yeah ."
"[10:35] Speaker_C | Or you could have no , you don't need that . So you s 'cause it's 'cause it's a speaker window , the speaker characterisation window comes up . So you've got the global one there , and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting . And then then the top five in that meet in global , the top five this meeting , and then the rest is r obvious , isn't it . Yeah ."
"[10:39] Speaker_B | Exactly , yeah ."
[10:43] Speaker_B | Yep . Yeah .
[10:45] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[10:45] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[10:46] Speaker_D | Right .
[10:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:00] Speaker_C | That occur .
"[11:02] Speaker_C | But you th some often the interesting ones don't occur , things like joke don't occur very often . Well they do sometimes , but they're not that common . One guy has top five joke . One of them is joke . He's an undergrad . That's quite funny . Yeah . Yeah , it's interesting , isn't it ? Yeah . He's the joker ."
"[11:14] Speaker_D | Okay . Actually yeah . This is good for browsing though . It's perfect . I mean that's sorta exactly what you wanna do and look at these things . And so Yeah , who's doing what ."
"[11:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , see , and that's what speaker characterisation gives you ."
[11:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:29] Speaker_B | Who's the one who dr
[11:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:00] Speaker_C | What percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes , in the meeting and globally separately , so once globally . Yeah ."
[12:03] Speaker_B | Are jokes . Yeah . Yeah .
[12:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[12:10] Speaker_C | Um I think most things are coded with a dialogue act . A lot of them are coded with Z_ , which means no label . So I just ignored that as well . 'Cause that's boring ."
[12:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:48] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
"[12:51] Speaker_D | Okay , that sounds real so that's sort of implemented now or is that or is it close ? Wow . Super . Okay . Like to test that ."
"[12:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's all done , yeah . All done , yeah ."
"[12:56] Speaker_C | Um yeah , I just have to I'll just finish there might be some polishing . I can't remember . But I think it's pretty much complete done . So I'll do that tonight . Just put it up there . So you can us start using that whenever ."
"[13:11] Speaker_B | You will , yeah ."
[13:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:16] Speaker_B | Sounds good .
"[13:22] Speaker_B | Yeah , I was thinking that um it sort of turned out that way a bit , didn't it ?"
[13:25] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . Well that's sorta what I was doing . It Like for your stuff do you have no .
"[13:29] Speaker_C | No , I just well it's called meeting and speaker . Well , I can judge it if you want ."
"[13:31] Speaker_D | Oh okay , alright ."
[13:33] Speaker_B | I don't know . Does it matter ?
[13:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:38] Speaker_C | We could put it in a sep in a p package .
"[13:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true too ."
[13:41] Speaker_C | If you can be bothered .
"[13:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , doesn't matter ."
[13:44] Speaker_C | Well it doesn't seem to make any differ I've never ever used Java packages . Doesn't even make any difference . As long as in the same directory it works . So sod it . Right .
[13:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[13:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:56] Speaker_B | I have one one m one little question that I reckon we should have a little icon for our browser .
[14:09] Speaker_D | Oh yeah . Yeah .
"[14:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , it will have something else . Just borrow a little Microsoft GIF like that ."
[14:15] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[14:31] Speaker_C | M_B_ .
"[14:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , anything you like , yeah ."
"[14:58] Speaker_B | I mean it's tiny , so we can't really put more than one character really or one sort of simple GIF ."
"[15:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly ."
[15:03] Speaker_D | I know . Anybody have any um artistic talent ? No ? No ? Ok
"[15:08] Speaker_B | No . Well , I can dr"
[15:09] Speaker_A | Oh .
[15:25] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:26] Speaker_B | Otherwise I'll I'll make up some M_ .
"[15:28] Speaker_D | How do you s add that to the to the Java programme ? Is it just basic little Okay . Uh-huh , yeah ."
[15:32] Speaker_B | I'm not sure actually . I'm thinking yeah .
[15:33] Speaker_C | That's really easy . You do it in um one of the w whatever the main is it you set w GIF or some Set f set set picture or something . It's really simple .
[15:39] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[15:42] Speaker_D | So just in the main frame . Okay . Okay , right ."
"[15:46] Speaker_D | Right , okay ."
"[15:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , probably ."
"[15:50] Speaker_D | Oh , so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's bigger ? Oh cool . Nice . Super ."
"[15:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , it just sticks it in the corner . Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[15:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_A | Sorry .
"[16:14] Speaker_D | Can we get sound on these machines ? Yeah . I wish Actually have you ever managed N oh yeah , you must have , yeah , got play any sort of music on the DICE machines ? Right , okay ."
"[16:23] Speaker_C | Not no , but I think if you put headphones in , it will just play just normally ."
"[16:26] Speaker_D | Oh right right . They have them on the front too , I think . Yeah ."
"[16:29] Speaker_B | if the sound-card is registered to your name , which it usually is not , and you have to re-boot , and sometimes it still doesn't work , then yeah ."
"[16:32] Speaker_D | Mm . Okay , right ."
[16:33] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[16:37] Speaker_D | Right .
"[16:38] Speaker_C | Sometimes it works , yeah ."
[16:39] Speaker_D | Damn .
[16:50] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Yeah . Yeah .
[17:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:13] Speaker_D | Are we gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and I don't know , still haven't found out if it's um"
[17:20] Speaker_A | Yeah we'll think about that .
[17:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:45] Speaker_C | I still can't make it run T_N_T_ from Java . Yeah , you try it . If you can make it work , then I'll be well chuffed ."
[17:45] Speaker_A | C_ .
[17:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , seriously ."
"[18:15] Speaker_C | Course , yeah ."
[18:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , good . That's my belief as well ."
[18:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:30] Speaker_C | So what does . Yeah . And it uh it's was apparently generated by going to d generate JavaDoc and it just went Spat it all out and they never bothered to uh d comment anything .
[18:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
"[18:45] Speaker_C | Yeah . At least get to know what methods are there . So without having to look at the source codes . Yeah , yeah ."
[18:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:51] Speaker_C | What ?
[18:51] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[18:52] Speaker_C | Yes , that's it right here ."
"[18:58] Speaker_D | So c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done ? I thought I thought we said th I thought we ch yeah , I thought we change it to the tenth or something . Um 'cause the thing is I mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh Oh , well we should do this or do this . Should we Um"
[19:03] Speaker_B | Friday ?
"[19:04] Speaker_C | Today , wasn't it ? It's the eighth ."
[19:05] Speaker_B | I thought it was Friday .
"[19:21] Speaker_D | so I don't know , do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like did when exactly were we gonna start the evaluation ?"
"[19:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think we both should , yeah ."
"[19:29] Speaker_B | Well that's the problem , because Steve hasn't given us any details , has he ?"
"[19:33] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay . Well we yeah , I guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah , come up with scenarios , that sort of thing . I mean that's that's fairly straight-forward . And could actually be fun . Yeah , exactly . That's true , just brain-storm , yeah . Yeah ."
[19:40] Speaker_B | That's true .
[19:44] Speaker_B | I I'm sure we could do that in like a meeting
[19:47] Speaker_B | and make it up together . Yeah .
"[19:53] Speaker_B | the thing is yeah , we had the the deadline last Friday , but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway , so I think we could set Monday ."
[19:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:00] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , yeah ."
[20:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:05] Speaker_D | Right .
[20:05] Speaker_B | And that would give us the whole weekend .
"[20:07] Speaker_D | To work on it as well . Yeah . . No , I've I've got my D_N_L_G_ presentation on Monday . I have to read the paper . Yeah ."
"[20:09] Speaker_A | What ? Oh yeah , you have your presenta Right , whatever . It's too much now . Well but yeah , Monday"
[20:21] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .

[20:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:35] Speaker_A | Just sh like w
"[20:36] Speaker_D | I'll probably just have a regular Tuesday meeting with him . Like we can send him an email , but I don't know if he's around even . He's not around this week , is he or that's why I think that's why we didn't have the the meeting ."
[20:44] Speaker_B | I don't know . I think it was .
"[20:46] Speaker_C | Don't know . Maybe it's just a day , I don't know ."
[20:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , 'kay ."
[20:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .

[20:54] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah .
[20:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:02] Speaker_A | Well so he's supposed to give us test subject . Did he say that or what ?
[21:05] Speaker_C | He said he might he would try .
[21:08] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:19] Speaker_B | Yes . Um I think if we if we don't get anything from him , then we should just do our friends basically ."
[21:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[21:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , if they have time . It's hard finding people ."
[21:34] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[21:39] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , that's true . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Yeah ."
[21:40] Speaker_B | But it's not gonna take long . It's only only gonna be half an hour maybe .
"[21:58] Speaker_B | Maybe , yeah . Well it will be . Yeah . It'll have to be , yeah ."
[22:05] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[22:09] Speaker_D | Uh no , I think like three or four maybe . Bet that would be a good yeah , I think that d No , that's that's a lot . No . Yeah , exactly . Like the thing like did an H_C_I_ course a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah , there's three people . Yeah . And that was fine . Then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people . Yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah . S We don't want to ."
"[22:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
[22:25] Speaker_B | Really ?
[22:30] Speaker_B | Really ?

[23:17] Speaker_D | Okay .
[23:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:21] Speaker_A | I think so .

[23:31] Speaker_C | The twenty fourth then .
"[23:32] Speaker_D | I thought it said twen I thought he said twenty fifth . Even though it's Good Friday , I thought okay . Yeah . Oh yeah . Easter two days yeah . No . Well it wasn't originally either . So Um Yeah , okay . Okay . So that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation . No evaluation I was gonna say . And report ."
[23:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .

[23:47] Speaker_A | No .
[23:52] Speaker_A | Can have a look .
[24:08] Speaker_A | I thought we would .
"[24:11] Speaker_C | Mm . oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway , I think . Otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise ."
"[24:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's probably c Like , it's a good target . It's a good Yeah ."
[24:19] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[24:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , you might be right ."
"[24:30] Speaker_D | Mm , right ."
"[24:36] Speaker_C | We have to write the report , yeah , and everything . We have to write everything ."
[24:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:38] Speaker_D | Actually it's fun No . No , it's it just funny that , you know , have it finish by Monday . 'Cause after Monday I'm pretty much free for about a week or so . It's like it's like if we had , you know , a bit more time . Yeah ."
"[24:45] Speaker_B | Exactly , me too . That's the point ."
"[24:49] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Well , I'm not free after this Monday , but I'm free at like after the eighteenth ."
[24:53] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[24:54] Speaker_D | Oh the next one , okay . See , I'm yeah I'm free this after this Monday , and it's well , why ? What else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff . I mean I'm not even worried about that . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay ."
[24:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Oh we have three ? S_P_ two .
[25:02] Speaker_B | Because because I don't have anything after the eighteenth apart from this .

[25:10] Speaker_D | Oh .
[25:10] Speaker_B | Well that's in on the eighteenth . Mm-hmm .
[25:17] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
[25:19] Speaker_B | Ooh .
[25:22] Speaker_A | In our uh timeline we r put in twenty fifth and that's the Friday I think .
"[25:26] Speaker_D | Okay . Maybe that was us then , not him . No actually I might have this stuff here ."
[25:29] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'm just that's why I'm trying to find his his dates . Whatever .
"[25:35] Speaker_D | Schedule . Yeah , Thursday twenty fourth ."
[25:40] Speaker_D | Deadline for submission of final report .
[25:51] Speaker_D | So twenty fourth so it we sh
[25:53] Speaker_B | Anyone fancy writing him an email ?
"[25:55] Speaker_A | Oh , it's actually twenty fourth ."
"[26:06] Speaker_D | We should have it done anyways . But okay , yeah . Sure ."
"[26:11] Speaker_D | Hopefully , but yeah . Is is that is that a part of the demonstration , did they want that information , the evaluation as part of yep ."
[26:11] Speaker_B | But it's still important to know . So we would def
[26:21] Speaker_D | Right .
[26:26] Speaker_B | What was the other one .
"[26:28] Speaker_B | Basically , how is how is it going with your evaluation proposal . Have you got people yet for us , or what are you thinking , and when ?"
[26:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:35] Speaker_D | Oh right .
[26:47] Speaker_B | No .
"[26:47] Speaker_D | Um there are a f a few little things . Um just made some comments the last meeting . Just general , like how it all integrates , blah blah blah , all this kind of stuff . But yeah ."
[26:55] Speaker_B | Do we know did he ever say how long it was supposed to be ?
[26:58] Speaker_D | No . I'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages .
[27:01] Speaker_B | Mm it's gonna be a lot .
"[27:03] Speaker_D | Although it's fifty percent of the mark I think , is it ? I think ."
[27:07] Speaker_B | But we can write a lot . I mean I think we should we should write everything .
[27:11] Speaker_D | Exactly . Well we have a bit of time to do the writing up .
"[27:11] Speaker_A | Yeah . 'Cause this I mean We have interim report of seven pages , and that's we can y yeah . We could p probably just expand that ."
[27:14] Speaker_D | So that'll be good .
[27:20] Speaker_B | Seven pages ? Oh .
[27:26] Speaker_A | I mean 'cause it I mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing .
[27:28] Speaker_D | Yeah . Just a fine-tuned or detailed and yeah .
[27:30] Speaker_B | True .
[27:33] Speaker_D | More stuff .
"[27:35] Speaker_B | Yeah , we can n"
"[27:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , that could be yeah , that could easily be five or six pages ."
[27:39] Speaker_A | So I don't think
"[27:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , should be good ."
[27:42] Speaker_A | page is gonna be problem .
[27:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
[27:50] Speaker_B | So do you wanna write him an email then ? That'd be good .
[27:52] Speaker_D | Sure .
"[27:58] Speaker_B | And uh when I get home today , which will be before"
[28:14] Speaker_D | Although just to get it out of the way . So I'll try and remember to do that to my own s
[28:19] Speaker_B | Well I will I will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if I had them by tomorrow evening .
[28:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:28] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[28:29] Speaker_B | Oh , I was gonna ask um"
"[28:32] Speaker_B | at the moment your search window ,"
[28:35] Speaker_B | how is it organised ?
[28:37] Speaker_D | Just basic um pretty much like the interim do you wanna do you have the interim stuff ? Just um sorta like Google type thing and just um Oh .
"[28:44] Speaker_B | But at the beginning , it when you haven't searched yet , is it is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty ? Okay ."
[28:51] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[28:55] Speaker_D | Then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there .
[29:02] Speaker_D | It doesn't do anything yet . S like that's that's the other big part . I mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows .
[29:04] Speaker_B | Okay .
[29:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:18] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah .
[29:20] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[29:30] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[29:35] Speaker_B | Um , yeah , maybe you wanna do um left-handed um yeah , one left-click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open ."
[29:48] Speaker_B | Which other ones ?
"[29:49] Speaker_B | Um yeah . Usually one left click , it's highlights it cross-highlights everything , I think . Yeah ."
"[29:58] Speaker_D | If you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour , then like just find it in the programme and just say , okay , just how this one does it . So if it's like the topic window or the whatever ."
"[30:23] Speaker_B | Mm no , that's difficult . Because it the transcription window does cross-highlighting ."
[30:30] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[30:32] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[30:37] Speaker_B | And um when you when you g um right-click on a topic , it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop po topic . And um and that works when you when you left-double-click on a topic oh , on a meeting , sorry , then it loads it ."
[30:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[30:54] Speaker_B | So you could
[30:56] Speaker_B | you could take that for loading .
[30:58] Speaker_D | Right .
"[30:59] Speaker_B | So if we have that um the same on this one , at least that you if you double-left-lick , then it loads ."
[31:07] Speaker_D | Okay .
[31:12] Speaker_A | Mm .
[31:14] Speaker_B | Mm .
[31:15] Speaker_D | So one left click just highlights Is that ?
[31:25] Speaker_D | The transcript or whatever it is .
[31:33] Speaker_A | Can I have it ?
"[31:34] Speaker_B | Because you n you don't you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be op I well I suppose if you have a if you have a local search , then it could cross-highlight ."
"[31:35] Speaker_A | Well , the one meeting ."
[31:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . That should be possible .
"[31:49] Speaker_B | Because you know , if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open , then you can't cross out anything ."
[31:49] Speaker_D | Right .
[31:52] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
"[31:55] Speaker_D | Although , yeah , this this will uh this is actually different from how we print it up here . Like if we're doing a global search , then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms . And then we'll either , you know , multi-select or , you know , choose the one we wanna actually do this wi I think multi-select would make the most sense . Well just um if there's like three of the top meetings , like like we said before , language , we're looking for the l word language and get the highest-rated ones . To actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six I mean or seventy five , whatever it is . Um so the r the results from that will , you know , narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search . Then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen . And if we can yeah . So it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least . Yep ."
[32:06] Speaker_B | Okay .
[32:12] Speaker_B | What do you mean by multi-select ?
"[32:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Oh , okay ."
"[32:36] Speaker_B | Oh , I see what you mean , yeah . Okay ."
"[32:52] Speaker_D | Yes , yes . Exactly , yep ."
"[33:04] Speaker_A | Um it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries fro using that text extractor thingy you wrote , Ray ."
[33:05] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[33:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , you have to start again . It's just do topics instead of seg yeah , you have to get the topics out instead of the segments . Uh yeah ."
[33:16] Speaker_A | You just like or
[33:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:23] Speaker_A | Excuse me . I just realised I haven't done that part yet .
[33:24] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[33:27] Speaker_B | Is it d very difficult to make another another GUI , but only for a global search ?"
"[33:39] Speaker_B | Just just take that away , the the local check-box . Because um hmm ?"
[33:44] Speaker_A | To have for the start-up . Oh . To have for the start-up . Uh-huh .
"[33:50] Speaker_D | You know , local anyways , yeah . No , that's easy . Sure , yep . That's that's quite t straight-forward ."
"[33:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , would you make that ? That'd be really handy . Everything else can just stay the same , you know . In fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check-box ."
[33:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:09] Speaker_C | To you're gonna be able to do a global search for topics ?
[34:16] Speaker_D | Yeah . Exactly .
[34:22] Speaker_A | What ?
[34:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:39] Speaker_C | Well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the Yeah , but at at the very least ."
"[34:42] Speaker_D | Okay . But we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics , since they don't have labels . Probably ? Okay . La label all the label ones I'll open 'em . Yeah , all the label twos , yeah . I don't know . Okay . Mm ."
[34:43] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[35:08] Speaker_C | Would , yeah . But if I collate yeah . Yeah , if I create X_M_L_ files , but if I m I'm not gonna do that . Um I did have a look at trying to create X_M_L_ files . It did look like a quite a a mission really . I suppose it's not it's it's as straightforward as writing in X_M_L_ files . But it's but it's organising the segment data though . It would just looks so complicated to get it from"
[35:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:35] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[35:47] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[35:49] Speaker_C | So I don't know really what we're gonna do about that .
[35:59] Speaker_B | Okay .
[36:00] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . I guess we just
[36:00] Speaker_B | Are we done ?
[36:04] Speaker_A | see what Steve says about the re-evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need
[36:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:09] Speaker_D | Yep .

[36:13] Speaker_A | anything . I guess we will see you on Thursday .
[36:17] Speaker_A | And Monday .
[36:19] Speaker_A | D_N_L_G_ .
"[36:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , we don't . Do we need another meeting this week ?"
[36:23] Speaker_D | Hmm . Probably not . I mean just get work done . I think that's what I've gotta do .
[36:30] Speaker_C | Mm .
[36:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:32] Speaker_C | Mm .
[36:33] Speaker_B | Hmm .

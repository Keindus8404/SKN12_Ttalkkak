"[00:38] Speaker_A | Is everyone ready to start ? Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running ."
[00:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[00:59] Speaker_A | Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint ."
[01:24] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:30] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:37] Speaker_B | Thank you .
[01:40] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[01:53] Speaker_B | Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen ."
[01:58] Speaker_B | That says go here .
"[02:02] Speaker_B | Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit ."
"[03:02] Speaker_A | Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?"
"[03:07] Speaker_B | Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well ."
[03:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[03:37] Speaker_B | Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed ."
[04:04] Speaker_A | What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
"[04:10] Speaker_A | Just every , every once in a while ?"
[04:13] Speaker_A | Just every once in a while or constantly ?
[04:15] Speaker_A | Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
"[04:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way ."
[04:49] Speaker_A | Right .
"[04:56] Speaker_B | Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Because you can't really see which way round it is ."
[05:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
[05:30] Speaker_A | Right .
"[05:30] Speaker_B | Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects ."
[05:46] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[06:08] Speaker_B | Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads ."
[06:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:37] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[06:39] Speaker_A | Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um"
"[06:46] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's true . And that would lead to an advanced yeah . If we have yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton ."
"[06:46] Speaker_A | display , and the glow in the dark thing"
[06:51] Speaker_A | might be difficult .
[06:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:58] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[07:22] Speaker_B | Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Sounds brilliant to me ."
[07:30] Speaker_A | Right .
[07:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[08:00] Speaker_B | Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one ."
[08:00] Speaker_A | Uh .
"[08:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as"
[08:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[08:41] Speaker_A | like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .
"[08:44] Speaker_B | I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . Yeah ."
"[08:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way ."
[09:01] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:12] Speaker_B | Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable ."
"[09:24] Speaker_C | Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top"
[09:25] Speaker_B | Yeah . Like I can't think of what .
[09:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:28] Speaker_C | Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . It's yeah ."
"[09:32] Speaker_B | Yeah . Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . Yeah ."
[09:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:32] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:37] Speaker_D | Like the skin ? Yeah .
[09:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:49] Speaker_D | So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . Okay . And the buttons obviously are rubber .
[09:52] Speaker_B | And then yeah . Yeah .
[09:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:56] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:59] Speaker_A | That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?"
[10:06] Speaker_B | As far as I know . It should be .
"[10:08] Speaker_A | Okay , we'll just say yeah . Yes , just why not . Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um"
"[10:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , tha"
[10:22] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:32] Speaker_A | Yeah . Just for environmental reasons .
[10:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:36] Speaker_D | I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .
[10:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:39] Speaker_D | So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
[10:42] Speaker_B | Yeah . Like as a backup for something .
[10:44] Speaker_C | Backup . Yeah .
[10:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:51] Speaker_C | That would be good yeah .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .
[10:55] Speaker_D | Right .
[11:06] Speaker_B | That's true . I just thought of that . Yeah . Yeah . May maybe that could be the backup . Instead of a battery . Like solar backup .
[11:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:14] Speaker_D | Although it needs some light , doesn't it ?"
"[11:17] Speaker_C | Do , do those calculators yeah ."
"[11:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then ."
"[11:21] Speaker_B | But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . It can be stored . It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . Like a few hours a day . ."
[11:21] Speaker_C | I don't know how it works .
[11:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:34] Speaker_A | I think that might be a little impractical though .
"[11:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah ."
[11:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:42] Speaker_A | Like people don't wanna have to worry about that .
"[11:43] Speaker_B | Yeah . I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . And it works . Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and ."
[11:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:57] Speaker_A | Yeah . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .
"[12:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , I suppose ."
[12:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:05] Speaker_A | Alright . Cool .
[12:06] Speaker_B | K okay .
[12:08] Speaker_A | 'S that the end of your presentation . Alright . Thank you .
[12:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:16] Speaker_B | There we go .
[12:17] Speaker_C | Thanks .
[12:29] Speaker_C | Oh .
[12:48] Speaker_C | You don't know why ? Oh okay .
[12:53] Speaker_C | Is it that one ?
[12:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:56] Speaker_C | Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user ."
[13:19] Speaker_C | And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
"[13:30] Speaker_C | Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about ."
[13:46] Speaker_A | Oh . Okay . Yeah .
[13:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:49] Speaker_C | I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Or maybe it's
[13:54] Speaker_B | Mm .
[14:01] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[14:05] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want ."
[14:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[14:17] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[14:19] Speaker_C | So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen ."
"[14:26] Speaker_B | I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume ."
[14:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:57] Speaker_B | I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that ."
[15:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:02] Speaker_D | So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?
[15:07] Speaker_A | Hmm ?
"[15:08] Speaker_C | No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per"
[15:16] Speaker_B | For inp
"[15:17] Speaker_C | Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen ."
[15:20] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .
[15:22] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:23] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:23] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:26] Speaker_C | But um
[15:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[15:44] Speaker_A | What do you mean ?
"[15:53] Speaker_C | Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . Yeah , something y"
"[15:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , as a button though . So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? Okay . Yeah . I like that idea ."
[15:58] Speaker_D | Mm .
[16:02] Speaker_C | Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .
"[16:06] Speaker_C | Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly ."
"[16:20] Speaker_C | Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple ."
[16:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .
[16:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:37] Speaker_A | A bit more too , yeah ."
"[16:45] Speaker_C | We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful ."
[17:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:13] Speaker_C | And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand ."
[17:27] Speaker_C | And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
[17:35] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:37] Speaker_B | Yep .
[17:38] Speaker_C | Does anyone have any questions ?
"[17:42] Speaker_A | Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look ."
[17:48] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[17:50] Speaker_D | I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons ."
[17:56] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[18:04] Speaker_A | But what about the lighting up effect ?
"[18:09] Speaker_A | Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up ."
[18:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:22] Speaker_D | Oh I see what you're saying .
[18:24] Speaker_D | Well y
"[18:24] Speaker_A | If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber ."
[18:26] Speaker_D | Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
[18:34] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[18:34] Speaker_D | But , but I guess , you mean from the back . Okay ."
[18:35] Speaker_A | Oh . Where would the light come from ?
"[18:38] Speaker_B | I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something ."
[18:41] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:47] Speaker_D | Right .
"[18:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of ."
"[18:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[18:51] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:52] Speaker_B | It should be able to mm-hmm .
"[18:55] Speaker_C | In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ? 'Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it ."
[19:05] Speaker_B | Li yeah .
[19:12] Speaker_A | Oh .
[19:15] Speaker_D | Okay .
[19:18] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[19:20] Speaker_C | I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?"
[19:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[19:27] Speaker_A | Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more"
[19:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:28] Speaker_A | Okay . Alright .
[20:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:31] Speaker_A | If it's do-able we can do . Yeah , sounds good to me ."
"[20:34] Speaker_C | So that's everything , then ?"
[20:37] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[20:37] Speaker_A | Alright , thank you ."
[20:42] Speaker_D | Okay is that my turn then ?
[20:43] Speaker_A | That means you're up . Yeah .
[20:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:45] Speaker_D | Alright .
[20:56] Speaker_D | Uh .
[21:02] Speaker_B | You're not plugged in yet .
"[21:26] Speaker_D | Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go ."
"[21:38] Speaker_D | Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed ."
"[21:55] Speaker_D | Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying ."
"[22:20] Speaker_D | face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use ."
"[22:40] Speaker_D | Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons ."
"[22:51] Speaker_D | So , my personal preferences here ,"
"[22:55] Speaker_D | um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen ."
[23:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:09] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[23:12] Speaker_D | Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness ."
"[23:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only"
"[23:26] Speaker_A | area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really"
[23:29] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[23:29] Speaker_B | It is strange .
"[23:33] Speaker_A | um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control ."
[23:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:51] Speaker_A | But they still need to um fit into people's decor though .
[23:51] Speaker_D | Or colour schemes .
[23:55] Speaker_D | Right .
"[23:55] Speaker_B | I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit ."
"[24:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[24:18] Speaker_D | The essence of strawberry . Yeah .
[24:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:46] Speaker_A | Tone it down . Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product ."
"[24:46] Speaker_D | I guess , yeah ."
[24:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:50] Speaker_D | One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog ."
[25:01] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[25:01] Speaker_D | Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind ."
[25:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[25:16] Speaker_D | Pretty straightforward ?
[25:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[25:22] Speaker_A | Alright , given that information ,"
[25:26] Speaker_A | we need to start making some more specific decisions .
[25:31] Speaker_A | So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .
[25:38] Speaker_D | There you go .
[25:51] Speaker_D | Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay .
[25:57] Speaker_A | But it's still around right ? Okay .
[25:59] Speaker_C | Where do you have to save it to ?
[26:03] Speaker_C | Okay .
[26:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:20] Speaker_A | I'm just trying to make this pop up now .
[26:31] Speaker_A | Alright . Here we go .
"[26:34] Speaker_A | Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we oh ."
[26:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:43] Speaker_A | Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .
[26:43] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[26:50] Speaker_A | Um , yeah ."
[26:51] Speaker_C | Just escape I think .
[26:51] Speaker_D | The PowerPoint ?
"[26:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Okay , so that's good ."
[27:01] Speaker_B | Kinetic yeah . Are we going to have a backup ?
[27:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:07] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[27:12] Speaker_A | But would a backup really be necessary ?
"[27:18] Speaker_A | I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,"
"[27:22] Speaker_B | I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and"
[27:22] Speaker_A | if there is backup .
"[27:29] Speaker_B | be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . I think yeah . I think no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Go for it ."
[27:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?"
[27:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points .
[27:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:44] Speaker_B | It could be fully kinetic energy . Yeah .
[27:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Environmentally conscious or something .
[27:48] Speaker_D | So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? Okay .
[27:49] Speaker_B | Is everyone happy with that ?
[27:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:55] Speaker_A | Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means ."
"[28:08] Speaker_A | Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?"
"[28:11] Speaker_B | Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons ."
[28:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:20] Speaker_A | I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?"
[28:22] Speaker_C | Yeah . I don yeah .
"[28:23] Speaker_B | Uh , so that's the simple ."
[28:23] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[28:24] Speaker_A | Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?"
[28:31] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[28:33] Speaker_A | Okay . That's called medium , or regular ?"
[28:38] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[28:40] Speaker_B | Regular chip .
"[28:41] Speaker_D | Oh , is regular not simple ?"
"[28:43] Speaker_C | Yeah . It's for the lighting , yeah ."
[28:43] Speaker_B | Lighting . Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .
[28:46] Speaker_D | Right right right .
"[28:48] Speaker_A | Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?"
[28:51] Speaker_B | So th
"[28:55] Speaker_B | I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber ."
[29:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:01] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Plastic with rubber"
[29:04] Speaker_B | Rubber . Yeah . Plastic rubber coat .
[29:04] Speaker_C | Yeah plastic coat .
[29:09] Speaker_A | coating and interchangeable
"[29:14] Speaker_B | Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that . Yeah ."
"[29:15] Speaker_A | yeah , interchangeable plates . Okay ."
[29:25] Speaker_A | User interface concept .
[29:27] Speaker_A | This is your time to shine .
"[29:29] Speaker_C | We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um"
[29:36] Speaker_B | Your screen ?
[29:38] Speaker_D | Think it was called command interface .
"[29:40] Speaker_A | Oh , yeah . Yeah ."
"[29:41] Speaker_D | Command interface , ."
[29:42] Speaker_C | The command inter
[29:43] Speaker_A | Command interface .
[29:43] Speaker_B | Ouch .
[29:45] Speaker_C | The command line interface yeah .
[29:46] Speaker_A | Did you say command line ? Okay .
[29:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:51] Speaker_A | Line interface .
"[29:56] Speaker_A | Alright , and supplements ."
[29:59] Speaker_A | What's that all about ?
"[30:00] Speaker_C | Um ,"
[30:02] Speaker_C | I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
"[30:08] Speaker_C | what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have ."
[30:27] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[30:31] Speaker_C | We haven't really decided what to do about that .
"[30:35] Speaker_A | Um , what are our choices here ?"
[30:43] Speaker_C | w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
"[30:50] Speaker_A | You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?"
[30:53] Speaker_B | The power .
[30:55] Speaker_B | Volume .
[30:56] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[30:58] Speaker_C | So pretty just just the basic button functions .
"[31:09] Speaker_A | Um , yeah ."
[31:14] Speaker_D | one of my presentations . About how often it was used . Do you remember that ?
"[31:17] Speaker_B | Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l"
[31:17] Speaker_A | Yep .
[31:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:19] Speaker_A | Yeah , it was hardly ever used really ."
[31:23] Speaker_A | Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .
"[31:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , each television ."
[31:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay , well we know we want numbers ."
[31:35] Speaker_D | The ch t
[31:38] Speaker_D | Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every once every two hours .
"[31:45] Speaker_D | Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that ."
"[31:50] Speaker_B | Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote ."
"[31:52] Speaker_C | You don't change that often , yeah ."
"[31:57] Speaker_A | Yeah , it does ."
[31:57] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[32:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , and different televisions . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of"
[32:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[32:07] Speaker_B | Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,"
[32:08] Speaker_A | changes like that .
[32:12] Speaker_A | Volume .
"[32:15] Speaker_D | The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Um , relevance of two ."
[32:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:28] Speaker_B | Mm .
[32:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:35] Speaker_A | Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .
[32:42] Speaker_D | Well that didn't some up on mine .
[32:43] Speaker_A | Should we have audio ?
[32:46] Speaker_A | It only comes up on mine usually .
"[32:47] Speaker_C | It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though ."
[32:48] Speaker_D | Oh .
[32:54] Speaker_C | Do you know ?
"[32:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same ."
"[33:08] Speaker_D | Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power ."
[33:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:15] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah uh I brilliant ."
[33:16] Speaker_C | That could be a sales pitch .
[33:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:21] Speaker_D | Okay .
[33:22] Speaker_A | Alright .
[33:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:23] Speaker_A | Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um ,"
"[33:33] Speaker_A | you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design ."
[33:37] Speaker_A | Wait a minute . Is that right ?
[33:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[33:40] Speaker_A | Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product ."
"[33:48] Speaker_A | Um ,"
"[33:49] Speaker_A | Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay ."
"[33:54] Speaker_A | And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen ."
"[33:59] Speaker_B | Okay . Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?"
"[34:01] Speaker_A | Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ?"
[34:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .

[34:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:38] Speaker_B | Y Yeah .
[34:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:40] Speaker_C | What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle ."
[34:50] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[34:52] Speaker_D | Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true ."
[34:54] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[34:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:11] Speaker_B | Tricky . A lot of things to consider . Hm .
[35:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:14] Speaker_A | Lots of yeah .
[35:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:17] Speaker_A | Alright .

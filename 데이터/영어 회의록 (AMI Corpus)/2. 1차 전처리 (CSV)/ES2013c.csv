"[00:54] Speaker_A | Hi Kate . Okay , carry on . Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay ."
[01:52] Speaker_A | minutes of the previous meeting .
"[02:00] Speaker_A | Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition ."
"[02:30] Speaker_A | And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um"
"[03:25] Speaker_A | So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held ."
[04:16] Speaker_A | Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?
[04:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:22] Speaker_C | Yes .
[04:22] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[04:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:33] Speaker_A | That one .
[04:41] Speaker_A | Go back .
[04:44] Speaker_A | Um the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ?
"[04:54] Speaker_A | Is that alright with everybody else ? Especially since Kate asked to be last . Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ ."
[04:55] Speaker_C | Yep .
[04:55] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[05:07] Speaker_A | You respond to whatever you get , huh ? Okay ."
"[05:29] Speaker_A | Ah , there it is ."
"[05:32] Speaker_D | Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things ."
[05:33] Speaker_A | Ta-da .
[05:53] Speaker_C | Right .
[06:07] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
[06:27] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[06:53] Speaker_D | Spongy . And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics"
[07:08] Speaker_A | Mm .
[07:27] Speaker_D | and some of the bold colours into a simple
[07:33] Speaker_D | handset . So . I also did a little research on um
[08:39] Speaker_D | I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .
[08:54] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[08:55] Speaker_A | It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone ."
[08:58] Speaker_D | Exactly .
[09:13] Speaker_A | Mm .
[10:11] Speaker_D | This is what I'm thinking .
[10:14] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[10:17] Speaker_A | Uh-huh mm .
"[10:20] Speaker_A | In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote ."
"[10:24] Speaker_D | Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers ."
[10:32] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[10:57] Speaker_A | Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so ."
[11:01] Speaker_D | Uh yeah .
[11:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:06] Speaker_D | Yeah . So this is an idea and I I you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg ."
"[11:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid ."
[11:22] Speaker_D | Thanks .
[11:27] Speaker_C | Yep .
[11:27] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[11:30] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[11:33] Speaker_C | as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable"
[11:41] Speaker_C | components . Is this to the market ?
"[11:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah ."
[11:55] Speaker_B | I was thinking titanium myself .
"[11:56] Speaker_C | I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny ."
[12:02] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[12:06] Speaker_D | They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh"
[12:19] Speaker_D | call it something that's fruit and veg
[12:27] Speaker_A | Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate
[12:37] Speaker_A | product ?
[12:43] Speaker_A | Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .
"[12:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ?"
[12:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:57] Speaker_A | Wo would that be agreeable ?
[12:57] Speaker_D | And then we could keep it titanium .
"[12:58] Speaker_B | Yeah . W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do ."
[13:14] Speaker_A | Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?
[13:17] Speaker_C | I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
[13:44] Speaker_D | Yeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy
"[13:48] Speaker_D | Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . It's hot on the streets , guys ."
"[14:09] Speaker_B | I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? No . Um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Right . This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface ."
[14:45] Speaker_A | Mm .
[14:50] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[14:53] Speaker_B | And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver ."
"[15:25] Speaker_B | So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment ."
"[15:51] Speaker_B | We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark ."
[16:13] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[16:16] Speaker_A | Remember , we only have forty minutes"
[16:19] Speaker_D | Mm .
[16:23] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[16:30] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[16:35] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[16:38] Speaker_B | Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um"
[16:57] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[17:13] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[17:14] Speaker_B | Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to"
[17:24] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[17:34] Speaker_B | select something . Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display ."
"[18:22] Speaker_B | And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . And well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um"
[18:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[19:06] Speaker_B | that may or may not be a good thing . Sorry . Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . So , thank you ."
[19:28] Speaker_D | That sounds good . Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?
"[19:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um"
"[19:47] Speaker_B | manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid ."
[19:51] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[19:51] Speaker_D | Hmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one . You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry ."
"[20:14] Speaker_C | Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it ."
[20:29] Speaker_C | But um
"[20:33] Speaker_C | I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise ."
[20:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:46] Speaker_D | But yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit ."
"[20:47] Speaker_B | We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier ."
[20:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:01] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[21:02] Speaker_C | Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available ."
[21:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:12] Speaker_B | Yep .
[21:12] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[21:15] Speaker_D | Thank you , Kate ."
"[21:17] Speaker_A | Thank you , Kate ."
[21:19] Speaker_D | Mm .
[21:20] Speaker_C | You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So so mine's a bit pointless .
"[21:33] Speaker_C | F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ?"
[21:36] Speaker_A | Yes .
[21:53] Speaker_A | There we go .
[21:55] Speaker_C | I don't have it on mine though .
[22:00] Speaker_D | Oh I think um
[22:02] Speaker_D | Florence resolved it by
[22:06] Speaker_D | F_ eight again .
"[22:09] Speaker_A | Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both ."
[22:25] Speaker_C | Should I do it again ?
[22:28] Speaker_D | Maybe .
[22:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:34] Speaker_A | This time it should come up both .
[22:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[22:55] Speaker_C | that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh"
[23:04] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[23:13] Speaker_C | like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,"
[23:15] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[23:21] Speaker_C | um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual"
"[23:40] Speaker_C | Well , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . So I was thinking that uh um a really simple"
[23:59] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[24:00] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[24:05] Speaker_C | a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
[24:16] Speaker_C | Like I guess an existing
"[24:20] Speaker_C | Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching"
[24:36] Speaker_C | the same channel on the screen .
"[24:39] Speaker_C | Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,"
[24:46] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[24:47] Speaker_C | um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So"
[25:02] Speaker_C | what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have
"[25:09] Speaker_C | a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching ."
[25:41] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[25:41] Speaker_A | Mm .
[25:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:49] Speaker_C | And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it"
"[26:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea ."
"[26:19] Speaker_C | colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too"
[26:24] Speaker_C | futuristic .
"[26:26] Speaker_B | It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately ."
[26:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:33] Speaker_C | Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .
[26:40] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[26:55] Speaker_C | And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the"
[26:57] Speaker_D | It's a duplication .
[26:57] Speaker_B | There is that .
[27:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[27:10] Speaker_C | you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . I don't think that's to taxing to uh"
[27:19] Speaker_C | s engineer . Um .
[27:22] Speaker_C | But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the
[27:29] Speaker_C | to the picture of the kiddie one .
"[27:35] Speaker_C | And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with"
[27:48] Speaker_C | buttons arranged in a
"[27:51] Speaker_C | kind of circle . Up , down , left , right ."
[27:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[27:53] Speaker_B | Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
"[27:55] Speaker_C | I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d uh describe it . you see"
"[28:08] Speaker_C | on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right ."
[28:11] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:32] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology ."
[28:38] Speaker_C | If I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right .
[28:43] Speaker_D | Oh nice .
"[28:45] Speaker_C | Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . What else have we got ?"
[28:45] Speaker_D | Um Hmm .
[28:51] Speaker_A | Huh .
[28:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:55] Speaker_D | Mm .
[28:58] Speaker_D | Wow .
"[29:06] Speaker_C | It's not quite a scroll wheel , but"
[29:09] Speaker_A | It's a selection wheel .
"[29:10] Speaker_C | it's a kind of selection in this circle , which I think is a really good idea ."
"[29:13] Speaker_B | But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper ."
"[29:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , like up , down , left and right ."
"[29:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down ,"
"[29:30] Speaker_C | next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle ."
[29:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:48] Speaker_C | And that's it .
"[30:19] Speaker_D | And have it abstract . You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract ."
[30:21] Speaker_C | Possibly . Yeah .
[30:22] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[30:25] Speaker_C | That also is possible .
[30:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[30:29] Speaker_D | I'm just just throwing out ideas .
[30:29] Speaker_A | Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .
[30:33] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[30:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the
[30:39] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[30:40] Speaker_C | Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so"
[30:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[30:52] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[30:56] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[30:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:59] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[31:02] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[31:03] Speaker_C | uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .
[31:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:08] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[31:08] Speaker_D | Nice . Good point .
"[31:11] Speaker_C | But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions ."
[31:21] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
"[31:22] Speaker_C | But then , that's complicated ."
[32:04] Speaker_A | Mm .
[32:06] Speaker_A | Right .
[32:10] Speaker_A | They want us to decide
"[32:14] Speaker_A | what form of energy are we going to use ,"
"[32:19] Speaker_A | which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar ."
"[32:40] Speaker_A | You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um"
"[32:57] Speaker_A | or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?"
[33:05] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[33:14] Speaker_B | Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost ."
[33:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
[33:25] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
[33:28] Speaker_A | What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?
"[33:31] Speaker_D | I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice"
[33:39] Speaker_D | um that it's there .
"[33:40] Speaker_C | It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient ."
[33:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[33:50] Speaker_D | It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving ."
[33:50] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[33:53] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[33:53] Speaker_C | Yeah . 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? It's like yeah , a good selling point ."
[33:59] Speaker_A | So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .
[34:03] Speaker_C | But it does depend how much
[34:05] Speaker_C | I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .
[34:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:09] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[34:09] Speaker_B | And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity ."
[34:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:12] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[34:16] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know ."
[34:17] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[34:27] Speaker_B | True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly ."
[34:27] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[34:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well ."
[34:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[34:32] Speaker_A | Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision ."
"[34:51] Speaker_B | Oh right , okay , I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um"
"[34:56] Speaker_B | chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative ."
[35:00] Speaker_A | Oh .
[35:07] Speaker_A | Okay .
[35:10] Speaker_B | I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .
"[35:11] Speaker_A | What about the ca yeah . Oh , the way we uh-huh ."
"[35:19] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
[35:22] Speaker_A | Um what about the case ?
"[35:25] Speaker_A | I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?"
"[35:46] Speaker_B | Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah ."
[35:55] Speaker_D | That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .
[35:59] Speaker_A | What about you ?
[36:00] Speaker_C | Do you not think it might need
[36:02] Speaker_C | like a kind of
"[36:05] Speaker_C | a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy"
[36:11] Speaker_D | Mm .
[36:13] Speaker_D | Kind of like an internal egg .
[36:14] Speaker_A | Cover . Uh-huh .
[36:21] Speaker_A | Plastic inside .
[36:25] Speaker_C | Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
"[36:25] Speaker_B | Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is ."
[36:35] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[36:36] Speaker_D | And with sports on television .
[36:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
[36:39] Speaker_D | You know . I su
"[36:40] Speaker_A | Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with ."
[36:41] Speaker_B | I should I should r
[36:47] Speaker_D | Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .
"[36:53] Speaker_A | Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?"
"[37:07] Speaker_C | Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen ."
[37:13] Speaker_B | Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .
"[37:28] Speaker_A | Okay , um"
"[37:34] Speaker_A | Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry ."
"[37:49] Speaker_C | No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually ."
"[37:49] Speaker_D | No we can't , actually ."
[37:54] Speaker_D | That's why I was looking over your shoulder
"[37:56] Speaker_A | Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one ."
"[38:06] Speaker_A | This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da ."
[38:12] Speaker_C | Now it's gone again .
[38:15] Speaker_A | Ah .
"[38:26] Speaker_A | Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . Anything else we need to do ?"
[38:31] Speaker_C | Oh yes .
[38:36] Speaker_D | Mm .
[38:52] Speaker_C | Great .
[38:59] Speaker_D | Sounds good .
[39:08] Speaker_C | Play-Doh .
[39:09] Speaker_A | And that's the end of this meeting .

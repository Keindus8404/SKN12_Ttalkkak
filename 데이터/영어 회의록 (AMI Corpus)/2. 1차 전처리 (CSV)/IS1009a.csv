[01:47] Speaker_A | Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do .
[01:58] Speaker_D | Okay .

"[02:12] Speaker_A | Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . Um ."
[02:25] Speaker_D | No .
"[02:29] Speaker_A | Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly ."
[02:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:45] Speaker_A | So maybe you wanna make some notes of that .
[03:08] Speaker_D | Okay .
[03:15] Speaker_A | Okay ?
[03:15] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[03:16] Speaker_A | All right . Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um .
"[03:23] Speaker_A | That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards ."
"[03:39] Speaker_A | Detailed design , same thing basically ."
[03:42] Speaker_D | Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay .
[03:45] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
"[03:56] Speaker_D | Functional , conception"
[04:00] Speaker_D | and detailed .
[04:12] Speaker_D | After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that .
"[04:19] Speaker_A | Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board ."
"[04:36] Speaker_D | Okay , I'll see what I can do . See if I r"
[04:48] Speaker_A | And remember you have to press so it works . Mm-hmm .

[05:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[05:20] Speaker_A | And you're Francine , right ? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?"

[05:35] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[05:57] Speaker_D | Uh , okay ."
"[06:07] Speaker_A | Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro ."
"[06:17] Speaker_A | Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international"
[06:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:26] Speaker_D | Okay .
[06:27] Speaker_A | and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .
[06:35] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
[06:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:40] Speaker_D | Profit .
[06:42] Speaker_D | Um is fifty mm .
"[06:43] Speaker_A | So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera ."
"[06:59] Speaker_A | Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?"
[06:59] Speaker_D | Oops .
"[07:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah ."
"[07:08] Speaker_A | I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . And um"
[07:09] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[07:16] Speaker_A | now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ?"
"[07:30] Speaker_A | Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?"
[07:30] Speaker_C | Uh .
[07:39] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
"[07:41] Speaker_B | Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system ."
"[07:45] Speaker_A | Small , right . Mm-hmm ."
[07:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[08:00] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[08:01] Speaker_C | Audio player . Oh . Okay .
[08:06] Speaker_A | So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .
"[08:08] Speaker_B | Yes , exactly"
[08:09] Speaker_B | Yes .
[08:10] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[08:12] Speaker_B | Yes .
[08:14] Speaker_B | Yeah . Exactly .
[08:22] Speaker_A | Well .
[08:23] Speaker_D | Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .
[08:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:33] Speaker_A | It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design ."
[08:37] Speaker_D | That's right .
"[08:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , of course ."
[08:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:44] Speaker_A | Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know ."
"[08:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah ."
"[08:47] Speaker_B | Yes , exactly ."
[08:50] Speaker_B | Are different shapes . Yes .
[08:57] Speaker_B | Yes .
[08:57] Speaker_C | Yeah of course yeah .
"[08:58] Speaker_D | Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it ."
[08:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:04] Speaker_A | Yes .
[09:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[09:32] Speaker_D | Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink ."
[09:33] Speaker_B | Or a b
"[09:36] Speaker_A | If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know ."
[09:36] Speaker_B | Should ha
[09:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:38] Speaker_B | A fluorescent signal , yeah ."
[09:40] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay .
"[09:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah ."
[09:46] Speaker_C | May not be beep .
"[09:50] Speaker_C | Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light ."
[09:52] Speaker_D | And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
"[10:05] Speaker_A | Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know ."
[10:13] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:27] Speaker_B | Yes .
[10:28] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[10:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah ."
[10:39] Speaker_D | So the light sensor would activate the signal .
[10:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[10:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Yes .
[10:58] Speaker_D | But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .
"[11:05] Speaker_D | Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly ."
[11:06] Speaker_C | I i we can't do it .
"[11:08] Speaker_D | I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay ."
"[11:18] Speaker_A | Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here ."
"[11:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , good point ."
"[11:25] Speaker_A | Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? The industrial designer That's you ."
[11:31] Speaker_C | Me yeah .
[11:33] Speaker_B | Yes .
[11:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:44] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical ."
"[11:46] Speaker_A | Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back ."
[11:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:51] Speaker_C | Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design ."
[12:00] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:21] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:25] Speaker_D | We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
[12:26] Speaker_A | That's right .
[12:29] Speaker_A | That's right .
"[12:31] Speaker_A | And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah ."
"[12:44] Speaker_A | So um we have well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ?"

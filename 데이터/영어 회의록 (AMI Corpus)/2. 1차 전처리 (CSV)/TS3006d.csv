"[00:02] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not ?"
[00:08] Speaker_B | Oh no .
[00:14] Speaker_B | No n I I already did it . It's not much . It's just one question .
[00:14] Speaker_C | Did you do your questionnaire already ?
[00:14] Speaker_D | No .
[00:18] Speaker_A | Because we have a problem .
[00:18] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[00:23] Speaker_A | If you look closely , you can see ."
[00:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[00:29] Speaker_A | Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .
[01:03] Speaker_A | And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour .
[01:08] Speaker_A | Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?
[01:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
[01:18] Speaker_C | Yeah but everything is .
[01:20] Speaker_A | Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .
[01:24] Speaker_D | No .
[01:29] Speaker_D | Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery .
[01:31] Speaker_A | Batteries ?
[01:32] Speaker_B | I think the battery option .
"[01:32] Speaker_C | Just a normal battery then , yeah ."
[01:32] Speaker_A | Batteries .
[01:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[01:43] Speaker_C | Oh my goodness .
[01:47] Speaker_B | Oh no .
[01:55] Speaker_A | Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?
[02:00] Speaker_C | Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything .
[02:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:23] Speaker_C | How about Sorry .
[02:36] Speaker_C | That's what I was thinking .
[02:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:41] Speaker_C | A a
[02:41] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[02:43] Speaker_B | But we don't have any basic options any more .
[02:46] Speaker_A | Uh yeah . We do .
[02:47] Speaker_C | And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well .
[02:48] Speaker_D | F_ eight .
[02:52] Speaker_A | They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . You were saying something .
[03:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[03:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[03:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um Now let's look ."
[03:21] Speaker_B | Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display .
[03:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[03:30] Speaker_C | Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then .
[03:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:34] Speaker_D | The joystick .
[03:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[03:42] Speaker_D | Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah ."
"[03:42] Speaker_C | If you if you go to If you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example ."
[03:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:53] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[03:57] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[03:58] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[03:58] Speaker_C | But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button ."
[04:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:22] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[04:33] Speaker_C | Yeah it's r Yeah .
[04:34] Speaker_D | You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .
[04:37] Speaker_B | So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons .
[04:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:45] Speaker_A | Uh yeah .
[04:45] Speaker_D | Well not all . Not s not sound I guess .
[04:46] Speaker_B | But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .
[04:54] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .
[05:00] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[05:02] Speaker_A | You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back ."
[05:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?
"[05:13] Speaker_A | Oh , that's for the speech ."
[05:14] Speaker_D | Speech recognition .
[05:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:17] Speaker_D | Right .
[05:17] Speaker_A | S s Drop speech recognition ?
[05:21] Speaker_B | We we d
"[05:22] Speaker_C | Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons ."
[05:30] Speaker_A | Buttons . That's not very easy to use .
[05:31] Speaker_D | Buttons .
[05:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:33] Speaker_D | No , it can be disturbed by by noise and"
[05:34] Speaker_C | No .
[05:37] Speaker_C | Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .
[05:38] Speaker_D | stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see .
[05:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:55] Speaker_D | Uh well no I was wrong . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .
[06:02] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[06:03] Speaker_A | Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons ."
[06:08] Speaker_B | We lose our whole concept . Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_ .
"[06:11] Speaker_D | No , but Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six ."
[06:18] Speaker_A | Okay so we drop the speech .
[06:24] Speaker_A | And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .
[06:25] Speaker_D | Yeah . Let's drop the speech .
[06:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:29] Speaker_D | Sixteen Euros .
[06:33] Speaker_D | But y y
"[06:34] Speaker_A | Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button ."
[06:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:56] Speaker_A | So that's one Euro .
[06:57] Speaker_D | S so so you activate the menu .
"[06:59] Speaker_B | If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons ."
"[07:07] Speaker_B | With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera ."
[07:15] Speaker_D | Yeah . .
[07:16] Speaker_A | That would save zero point two Euros compared to No .
"[07:25] Speaker_A | Yeah . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two ."
[07:25] Speaker_B | No it's it's n Yeah .
"[07:31] Speaker_D | Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . And then and the power button . So that's five ."
[07:36] Speaker_A | Volume .
[07:40] Speaker_A | And the power button .
[07:44] Speaker_A | That's the basic .
"[07:44] Speaker_D | That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu ."
"[07:56] Speaker_D | Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back ."
"[08:18] Speaker_D | Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button ."
[08:34] Speaker_A | Yep .
[08:39] Speaker_D | But we can't drop three buttons . But I see that's Yeah . So that's not a good idea .
[08:40] Speaker_A | Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive .
[08:46] Speaker_A | That's not an option .
"[08:54] Speaker_A | Menu , power ."
"[08:56] Speaker_D | Yeah . F of the four things ? Yeah , th power ."
[08:58] Speaker_A | Four arrows ?
[09:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Power . Th Yeah that's five .
[09:13] Speaker_A | We have a Back and a Okay button .
"[09:18] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay that's seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display ."
[09:20] Speaker_A | And the Menu .
"[09:28] Speaker_D | Oh , well okay ."
[09:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display ."
[09:41] Speaker_A | The L_C_D_ ? Yeah .
[09:43] Speaker_B | Let's make the Let's make the case plastic .
[09:49] Speaker_D | Instead of r
[09:49] Speaker_A | Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .
[09:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:56] Speaker_D | Yeah but but that's not our market .
[09:56] Speaker_C | True .
[09:59] Speaker_A | No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .
"[10:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , plastic with special colour ."
[10:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:19] Speaker_A | Yep . Yeah , yeah ."
[10:20] Speaker_B | So we do one one s Yeah .
"[10:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay . Plastic ."
"[10:24] Speaker_D | And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?"
[10:29] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[10:32] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[10:32] Speaker_D | We still have problem of two Euros .
"[10:37] Speaker_B | No the buttons , those are really needed ."
[10:40] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[10:41] Speaker_D | Yeah we can't drop them .
"[10:50] Speaker_C | Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter ."
[11:03] Speaker_D | Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo .
[11:06] Speaker_C | Well yeah .
[11:09] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[11:12] Speaker_A | Yeah and something else .
"[11:13] Speaker_D | Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right ."
[11:23] Speaker_C | And then if w
[11:27] Speaker_A | No y you would rec
[11:36] Speaker_A | Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah .
[11:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:40] Speaker_C | Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .
[11:45] Speaker_C | Oh .
[11:47] Speaker_C | Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .
[11:49] Speaker_B | But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?
[11:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:55] Speaker_A | Three . Up , down , Okay ."
"[11:56] Speaker_C | Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options ."
[11:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:01] Speaker_D | You you press it for like three seconds .
[12:10] Speaker_D | Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .
[12:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button ."
[12:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:32] Speaker_C | I guess we have to .
[12:32] Speaker_D | It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half .
"[12:38] Speaker_D | So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left ."
[12:40] Speaker_A | Yeah . You see ? Oh still Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_D | Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option .
"[13:01] Speaker_B | No no , it has to be um curved ."
[13:02] Speaker_D | We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?
[13:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:05] Speaker_C | Yeah it says right here .
[13:09] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[13:10] Speaker_D | Well yeah . yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature ."
"[13:26] Speaker_B | drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons ."
[13:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:31] Speaker_A | Buttons . That's Oh yeah since we only have one button .
[13:36] Speaker_D | Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
"[13:39] Speaker_A | I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular ."
[13:39] Speaker_B | Just something else than than black or white I think .
[13:46] Speaker_D | S yeah . Alright .
[13:47] Speaker_A | Grey and rubber .
[13:49] Speaker_C | But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Damn .
[13:50] Speaker_A | Of plastic .
[13:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option ."
[13:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:58] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
[14:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:08] Speaker_C | Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it ."
[14:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:12] Speaker_C | I don't know .
"[14:15] Speaker_A | No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no ."
[14:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:23] Speaker_D | Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .
[14:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:26] Speaker_A | Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ?
[14:34] Speaker_B | No no it has to be curved . Yeah .
[14:36] Speaker_D | Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . And a screen .
[14:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:38] Speaker_B | Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something ."
[14:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . That's the most import
[14:42] Speaker_A | Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ?
[14:43] Speaker_B | Yeah or spe special form ?
[14:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[14:46] Speaker_D | S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Maybe that's nicer ."
[14:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:52] Speaker_D | But we don't have any buttons . So do d Uh make it a special colour then .
[14:59] Speaker_D | Yeah ma make it a special colour then .
[15:02] Speaker_B | Yeah . Okay . Yeah .
[15:05] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[15:08] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[15:12] Speaker_B | Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay ."
[15:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:19] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[15:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . Okay .
[15:38] Speaker_C | It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .
[15:38] Speaker_A | Did I save it ?
[15:44] Speaker_C | Oh yeah ?
[15:48] Speaker_D | Alright .
[15:50] Speaker_A | Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute .
[16:09] Speaker_D | Yeah what's the next uh phase ?
[16:14] Speaker_D | Uh the agenda .
[16:17] Speaker_D | By your humble P_M_ .
[16:18] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[16:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:38] Speaker_C | Drop everything . Yeah .
"[16:38] Speaker_D | Drop , yeah ."
"[16:43] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah it was more important , so I just"
[16:46] Speaker_C | For Yeah .
"[16:47] Speaker_A | pushed up the agenda . Uh ,"
[16:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:51] Speaker_A | evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ?
[17:02] Speaker_A | Uh you put it in the .
[17:03] Speaker_D | We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Alright .
[17:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:15] Speaker_A | F_ five .
[17:33] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[17:37] Speaker_D | Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself ."
"[17:48] Speaker_D | Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No ."
[17:52] Speaker_A | Alt up
[18:01] Speaker_D | And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ?
[18:11] Speaker_D | Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions .
[18:23] Speaker_D | How do you think about that ?
[18:35] Speaker_D | Yeah the us u
[18:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:41] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[18:46] Speaker_D | Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen ."
[18:48] Speaker_B | Yep .
[18:57] Speaker_D | So on a scale from
"[19:00] Speaker_D | one to seven , what do you think ?"
[19:02] Speaker_B | Two or three .
[19:03] Speaker_D | Huh ?
[19:04] Speaker_B | Two or three .
[19:05] Speaker_D | Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? I agree on two .
[19:06] Speaker_A | Two .
[19:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:17] Speaker_A | Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two ."
[19:17] Speaker_C | Yeah alright .
[19:22] Speaker_D | Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .
[19:25] Speaker_A | Okay then I say three .
"[19:27] Speaker_D | Yeah ? You say three , and you you said al also three ? Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better ."
[19:27] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
[19:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:39] Speaker_A | Hmm . M maybe underline .
[19:41] Speaker_B | Or give it a colour .
"[19:48] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore ."
[20:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:05] Speaker_D | The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings .
[20:18] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah .
[20:20] Speaker_B | Yeah true .
[20:27] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:33] Speaker_D | Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Power button .
[20:33] Speaker_C | Yeah the next Not so much so .
[20:37] Speaker_A | Nope .
"[20:39] Speaker_D | Do we ha still have a power button ? Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ?"
[20:41] Speaker_A | Uh check with the Excel sheet .
[20:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:45] Speaker_C | Yeah it's uh it's integrated .
"[20:45] Speaker_D | Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah . I don't know . Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions ."
[20:47] Speaker_B | It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah .
[20:49] Speaker_A | Yeah integrate it .
[20:52] Speaker_C | E exactly just like a m mobile .
[20:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[21:02] Speaker_D | Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no ."
[21:07] Speaker_D | So it's I don't know .
"[21:12] Speaker_B | Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? No , you have to scroll through the menu , before"
[21:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:21] Speaker_C | Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,"
[21:29] Speaker_D | Hmm ?
"[21:31] Speaker_C | It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it ."
[21:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:39] Speaker_D | But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
"[21:43] Speaker_C | No because it has four arrows , right ?"
"[21:46] Speaker_A | No , not anymore . Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in ."
[21:47] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:51] Speaker_C | Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick .
[21:51] Speaker_A | Like on the the mouse .
"[21:54] Speaker_D | No we have n we have no buttons left . So the joystick was not an option . So so you hav So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Alright ."
[21:58] Speaker_C | Say .
[22:00] Speaker_C | Yeah that is a bummer .
[22:08] Speaker_A | To get into menu . Yeah .
"[22:16] Speaker_D | But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . So that's Yeah but that that's not a question . Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . Well I think it's pretty much in the middle ."
[22:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . Four .
"[22:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , im in the menu ."
[22:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:37] Speaker_B | Yeah . Five .
"[22:37] Speaker_C | Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah ."
[22:39] Speaker_D | Yeah . Five or six ?
[22:41] Speaker_A | Five .
[22:43] Speaker_C | Okay five . Let's not diss our remote .
[22:43] Speaker_B | Five . Yep .
[22:44] Speaker_D | Five ? Alright . Yeah .
[22:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:54] Speaker_C | Yep .
[23:02] Speaker_C | But Uh yep .
[23:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , I say two ."
[23:15] Speaker_D | I say two then .
[23:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:19] Speaker_D | Yeah but that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question .
[23:19] Speaker_C | Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost .
[23:24] Speaker_D | This one .
[23:25] Speaker_B | I think a two . No .
[23:26] Speaker_A | Two .
[23:27] Speaker_D | Two yeah . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What ? Oh not the bold one .
[23:29] Speaker_B | Yep .
[23:32] Speaker_A | Yeah definitely .
"[23:35] Speaker_C | It's way more practical , yeah ."
[23:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:56] Speaker_A | You still have rubber d Or no .
"[23:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button ."
[23:58] Speaker_B | No you got a plastic .
[23:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:04] Speaker_D | The button has also colour . Yeah .
[24:05] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Okay .
[24:08] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .
[24:13] Speaker_A | Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .
[24:14] Speaker_D | Mm mm .
[24:15] Speaker_B | Yeah . You only have one Yeah .
"[24:16] Speaker_D | Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something ."
[24:18] Speaker_C | And and colour .
[24:21] Speaker_C | Yeah . S
[24:24] Speaker_B | Four . Yeah .
[24:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , I mean it's"
[24:28] Speaker_A | Yeah or three .
[24:30] Speaker_D | worth the Yeah .
[24:31] Speaker_A | We have something .
"[24:31] Speaker_C | Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh ."
[24:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:46] Speaker_A | New . Yeah .
[24:48] Speaker_D | Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red .
[24:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:02] Speaker_A | Um oh yeah .
[25:04] Speaker_C | Of course .
[25:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:24] Speaker_D | But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing ."
[25:28] Speaker_C | Hell yeah . If we have only one button .
[25:31] Speaker_D | Yeah . So I will say that is very true .
[25:36] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:49] Speaker_C | No .
[25:56] Speaker_B | Ah i
[25:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:02] Speaker_C | Yeah exactly .
[26:09] Speaker_D | Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .
[26:14] Speaker_D | What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ?
[26:17] Speaker_A | No not anymore .
"[26:19] Speaker_D | So a six , more ."
[26:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:23] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[26:31] Speaker_B | Yeah that looks uh great .

[26:52] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[26:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long ."
[26:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:55] Speaker_C | So I would go for one .
[26:58] Speaker_D | Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate
[27:00] Speaker_B | Yeah . S
[27:03] Speaker_B | Yep .
[27:04] Speaker_C | Okay yeah .
[27:10] Speaker_D | Yeah . Logo . Okay I will go go for two .

[45:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[45:10] Speaker_B | Yeah . Especially after the first meeting .
[45:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[45:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[45:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess ."
[45:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[45:18] Speaker_C | Yeah . Definitely .
[45:20] Speaker_A | Okay and was that due to my leadership ?

[45:40] Speaker_B | Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah .
"[45:48] Speaker_D | If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh"
[46:00] Speaker_C | We were pretty democratic .
[46:01] Speaker_D | the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .

I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh"

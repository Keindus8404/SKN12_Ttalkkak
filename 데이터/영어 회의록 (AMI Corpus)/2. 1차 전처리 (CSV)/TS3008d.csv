"[01:15] Speaker_A | Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting ."
"[01:23] Speaker_A | Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? You two guys ? Okay . Go ahead ."
[01:34] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[02:05] Speaker_C | 'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh"
[02:25] Speaker_C | is uh
[02:34] Speaker_C | it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher .
"[02:42] Speaker_C | Um ,"
"[02:51] Speaker_B | Uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button ."
[02:51] Speaker_C | The functions .
[03:04] Speaker_B | Uh then the the the nine uh channels .
[03:09] Speaker_B | Uh the volume uh
"[03:13] Speaker_B | uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext I thought that was th"
"[03:25] Speaker_A | Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button ?"
"[03:27] Speaker_B | Oh , the mute button ."
[03:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[03:28] Speaker_C | But uh that It's uh here then , in the middle ."
[03:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:31] Speaker_A | Huh .
"[03:31] Speaker_D | Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button ."
"[03:35] Speaker_C | Yes , um"
[03:37] Speaker_C | we've disc
[03:42] Speaker_C | Most of the users
"[03:45] Speaker_C | Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah ."
"[03:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , and a and a triangle on that ."
"[03:49] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think ."
[03:52] Speaker_D | Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .
"[04:08] Speaker_A | uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers ."
[04:12] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[04:13] Speaker_D | All n no , that's um kinda dependent on the television ."
"[04:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , true , yeah ."
[04:15] Speaker_C | It's a television . Yes .
[04:21] Speaker_B | Uh I think so .
"[04:22] Speaker_C | Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes ."
[04:28] Speaker_B | Zero ?
"[04:29] Speaker_D | A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line ."
[04:30] Speaker_B | May maybe here ?
"[04:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds No , I don't think so ."
[04:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:37] Speaker_B | And then a second .
"[04:38] Speaker_D | No , that's dependent on the television ."
[04:41] Speaker_D | I do know so .
[04:43] Speaker_B | Is it depending on television ?
"[04:44] Speaker_A | Nah , I don't think so really , because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten ."
[04:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:02] Speaker_A | No , I think uh I really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply ."
[05:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:14] Speaker_C | Yes , but"
"[05:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing ."
"[05:25] Speaker_C | No , no , but s"
"[05:26] Speaker_D | No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i"
"[05:29] Speaker_A | No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one ."
[05:34] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[05:39] Speaker_D | Yes , that's true ."
[05:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:48] Speaker_B | True .
"[05:50] Speaker_A | I think it works that way , really ."
"[05:51] Speaker_D | No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space ."
"[06:01] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button ."
"[06:02] Speaker_C | Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons ."
"[06:13] Speaker_A | Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . I think it's exact the same thing when y"
[06:13] Speaker_D | Yep . True .
"[06:18] Speaker_C | Yes , but some television don't support it ."
[06:20] Speaker_B | But the ex
"[06:45] Speaker_D | No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c"
[06:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:51] Speaker_A | But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is . Think about it .
[07:03] Speaker_A | And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .
"[07:09] Speaker_D | No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television ."
"[07:15] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . But okay , we we'll impl"
"[07:30] Speaker_D | No , definitely not . Definitely not ."
[07:32] Speaker_B | We'll discuss them in the usability lab .
"[07:34] Speaker_A | No , we'll apply them then for now ."
[07:35] Speaker_B | Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .
[07:41] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
[07:48] Speaker_C | And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input .
[07:49] Speaker_D | Yes .
[07:51] Speaker_B | Ach .
"[07:54] Speaker_A | Yeah but okay . What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said ."
"[07:54] Speaker_D | Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . Yeah ."
[07:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:05] Speaker_C | No , no ."
"[08:14] Speaker_C | Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press ."
[08:18] Speaker_A | I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M
[08:25] Speaker_A | Th won't work wi with uh to have that special button .
"[08:27] Speaker_C | No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher ."
[08:42] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[08:42] Speaker_A | Okay , well we'll see ."
"[08:43] Speaker_C | When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals ,"
[08:52] Speaker_C | Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y
[08:59] Speaker_C | most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote .
[09:03] Speaker_D | Okay . I kinda miss the docking station .
[09:21] Speaker_C | Yes .
[09:21] Speaker_D | No nothing really trendy about it .
"[09:26] Speaker_C | But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh"
[09:26] Speaker_D | The button .
[09:42] Speaker_D | Yep .
[09:50] Speaker_C | uh hearing devices .
"[09:51] Speaker_D | I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices ."
[10:05] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[10:10] Speaker_D | Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course ."
"[10:15] Speaker_D | The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit ."
"[10:23] Speaker_C | No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same ."
"[10:30] Speaker_C | When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it ."
"[10:40] Speaker_D | Yes , but uh I I g"
[10:55] Speaker_C | But it's just an idea .
"[11:00] Speaker_C | But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this ."
[11:04] Speaker_B | You can .
[11:05] Speaker_B | But i i i it's backwards .
"[11:11] Speaker_B | But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station ."
"[11:23] Speaker_C | Yes , little holer littler Uh , little products go deeper in it ."
"[11:27] Speaker_D | Yeah . That i that is possible , yep ."
"[11:28] Speaker_A | Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . But we have to look n I don't know ."
"[11:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure , you're right ."
[11:35] Speaker_C | Yes . And uh uh
[11:38] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[11:39] Speaker_C | the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button ,"
[11:42] Speaker_D | I don't like the colours .
[11:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[11:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:58] Speaker_C | which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb ."
[12:05] Speaker_C | So it's it's it's really good design .
[12:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright .
[12:09] Speaker_A | Yes . That's it ?
"[12:11] Speaker_C | Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it ."
[12:18] Speaker_D | The light .
[12:24] Speaker_D | Okay . And other lights ?
[12:25] Speaker_A | I think added lights are gonna be a problem too .
"[12:27] Speaker_C | Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it ."
"[12:30] Speaker_D | No , o on the on the front ."
"[12:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo ."
[12:36] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[12:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , why not ?"
[12:42] Speaker_D | Of course .
"[12:43] Speaker_A | Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough ."
[12:43] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:02] Speaker_C | Yes .
[13:06] Speaker_C | Yes .
[13:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:07] Speaker_D | Uh , in the same colour as the side ."
[13:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
"[13:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think I think that'll be good ."
[13:18] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[13:26] Speaker_A | Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 'Cause I also don yeah , it's depends on the costs and such . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay . Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda ."
[13:27] Speaker_C | Yes .
[13:27] Speaker_D | Yep .
[13:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:38] Speaker_D | We will .
"[13:46] Speaker_D | Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah ."
[13:46] Speaker_C | No .
[13:50] Speaker_A | Detail design .
[13:56] Speaker_A | Evaluation criteria .
"[13:59] Speaker_D | Yep , that's me ."
[14:01] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:02] Speaker_B | Okay .
[14:13] Speaker_D | Go away .
"[14:18] Speaker_D | Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but"
"[14:40] Speaker_D | the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?"
[14:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:12] Speaker_D | Yes .
[15:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:17] Speaker_D | Background colour .
[15:20] Speaker_D | How do you guys feel ?
[15:20] Speaker_A | Casting . Yeah .
[15:30] Speaker_D | The different designs . Yes .
[15:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:34] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:34] Speaker_C | more to your own personality or or house style .
"[15:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay ."
"[15:41] Speaker_D | No , not not fronts , but different designs ."
"[15:42] Speaker_B | No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah ."
[15:43] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[15:44] Speaker_D | And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . What ?"
"[15:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally ."
[15:54] Speaker_C | Or forty .
[15:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:57] Speaker_B | We can make it a one .
[15:57] Speaker_D | Personally .
"[15:59] Speaker_D | Yes , but what is it ?"
[16:02] Speaker_C | I think two or three .
[16:04] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_B | I agree .
[16:07] Speaker_D | Two or three .
"[16:08] Speaker_B | Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two ."
"[16:14] Speaker_D | I was thinking about three , so I guess"
"[16:17] Speaker_D | three is uh a bit uh oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy ."
"[16:17] Speaker_B | Okay , three ."
[16:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:30] Speaker_C | Yes .
[16:30] Speaker_B | Two .
"[16:32] Speaker_D | Yeah ? Antek , you agree ?"
"[16:32] Speaker_B | One . One . Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree ."
[16:32] Speaker_C | Yes .
[16:34] Speaker_C | Yes .
[16:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . You're not Antek .
[16:35] Speaker_A | That's one thing for sure .
[16:37] Speaker_D | I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .
[16:44] Speaker_C | Yes .
[16:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[16:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , two or a one , I guess . It's something we really put work into ."
"[16:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , I yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . And our oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ?"
[16:51] Speaker_C | It's all about the buttons .
[17:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:10] Speaker_A | Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . And telete"
"[17:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , well menu Yeah , maybe ."
"[17:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true . That's true ."
"[17:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , we don't know if the uh they're necessary ."
[17:21] Speaker_A | I think a two .
"[17:22] Speaker_B | Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree ."
"[17:22] Speaker_C | Can yes , three , two ."
[17:24] Speaker_D | Two or three ?
[17:26] Speaker_B | Mm two .
[17:28] Speaker_D | Two ? Antek .
"[17:33] Speaker_A | No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is yeah ."
[17:35] Speaker_D | we put it on a two ?
[17:37] Speaker_C | Yes .
[17:38] Speaker_D | The remote control has got a really trendy look .
[17:41] Speaker_C | Yes . A one .
[17:44] Speaker_D | Maarten .
"[17:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture ."
[17:45] Speaker_B | Well .
[17:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:50] Speaker_C | We we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .
[17:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:55] Speaker_D | Ever , yeah . Guido ."
"[17:57] Speaker_B | Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah . I I th"
[18:01] Speaker_A | But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .
"[18:04] Speaker_D | Yeah , uh I agree . I agree ."
[18:04] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[18:06] Speaker_B | Yeah . True , yeah ."
"[18:08] Speaker_D | I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ?"
[18:11] Speaker_A | A th a three .
[18:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:16] Speaker_C | Yes .
[18:19] Speaker_D | Great . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
"[18:25] Speaker_D | Uh , I copied that one ."
[18:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:33] Speaker_D | Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .
"[18:38] Speaker_B | No . We're not well , maybe the the the on the side ."
[18:38] Speaker_C | No .
[18:38] Speaker_A | No .
"[18:40] Speaker_C | No , not L_C_D_ , so ."
"[18:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , and the light ."
[18:46] Speaker_B | And the light maybe .
"[18:49] Speaker_D | Well , I g"
[18:52] Speaker_D | It's not seven ?
"[18:54] Speaker_A | No , six . Or seven maybe , yeah . Or six ."
"[18:55] Speaker_B | Well , six ."
"[18:56] Speaker_B | No , six ."
[18:57] Speaker_C | Six .
[18:58] Speaker_D | Why uh why not a seven ?
[18:58] Speaker_B | Six .
"[18:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , mine is seven ."
[19:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:04] Speaker_D | How ?
"[19:09] Speaker_A | No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it ."
"[19:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ?"
[19:23] Speaker_C | Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . It's a part of the remote . And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker .
"[19:24] Speaker_A | N no no , t ."
[19:25] Speaker_B | A docking station is innova
[19:29] Speaker_D | I think more m
[19:34] Speaker_D | Uh that that's n
"[19:35] Speaker_A | Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i yeah . No ?"
[19:40] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:46] Speaker_D | It's it's a six .
[19:47] Speaker_B | Six .
"[19:48] Speaker_D | That m f Yeah , for the retrieval function ."
"[19:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah ."
[19:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control .
"[19:54] Speaker_C | Yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ?"
"[19:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , v"
[20:01] Speaker_C | To put it on your head .
[20:17] Speaker_D | Remote control is easy to use .
"[20:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least ."
[20:19] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[20:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , a two ."
[20:21] Speaker_C | Yes .
[20:22] Speaker_D | I think a two . Yeah ?
"[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's good ."
[20:25] Speaker_B | More two .
[20:25] Speaker_D | Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh .
[20:32] Speaker_D | I've just filled uh
"[20:34] Speaker_A | Uh , here ."
[20:35] Speaker_D | Go away .
"[20:37] Speaker_D | I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten ."
[20:43] Speaker_D | It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
[20:45] Speaker_C | Yes .
[20:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . Definitely .
[20:46] Speaker_B | Yes .
[20:48] Speaker_C | In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ?
"[20:51] Speaker_D | No no no . No , just if they if they buy it ."
"[20:51] Speaker_A | Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two ."
"[20:55] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I think I think two ."
"[20:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , what do you think ?"
"[20:56] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two ."
[20:59] Speaker_D | Antek ?
"[21:00] Speaker_C | Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly ."
"[21:04] Speaker_A | Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty ."
"[21:04] Speaker_D | No , that's no comparison ."
"[21:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it ."
[21:12] Speaker_D | And I don't mean two people .
[21:12] Speaker_C | This is just guessing .
"[21:14] Speaker_A | Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two ."
[21:15] Speaker_C | Make it a two .
[21:15] Speaker_D | W w
"[21:17] Speaker_C | When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu"
"[21:20] Speaker_D | Right , the rem"
"[21:22] Speaker_D | The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan ."
[21:24] Speaker_A | Oh no .
"[21:26] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious ."
[21:28] Speaker_B | We don't have the slogan though .
"[21:32] Speaker_D | Oh , the slogan . Can we see the slogan ?"
"[21:33] Speaker_A | Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to ."
[21:34] Speaker_B | The logo .
[21:35] Speaker_C | A logo .
[21:37] Speaker_B | Underneath it or something .
"[21:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Maybe a three this time ."
[21:41] Speaker_D | Are we gonna do that ?
[21:44] Speaker_B | A three . Three .
"[21:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , a three ."
[21:46] Speaker_C | Yes .
[21:47] Speaker_D | Three ? I agree .
[21:50] Speaker_D | Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .
"[21:54] Speaker_A | Uh , it's a one or a two ."
"[21:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , two ."
[21:57] Speaker_C | Yes .
[21:58] Speaker_D | Two ? Two . Alright .
"[21:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , make it a two ."
[21:58] Speaker_B | Two .
"[22:02] Speaker_D | We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six ."
[22:17] Speaker_D | Twenty six .
[22:21] Speaker_D | It's a two point six .
"[22:25] Speaker_A | It's not that bad . Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two ,"
"[22:26] Speaker_D | Alright , we yeah ."
[22:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . True .
"[22:34] Speaker_A | which is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is was uh the evaluation ?"
[22:43] Speaker_D | We did a pretty nice job until now .
[22:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:51] Speaker_D | Whatever .
"[22:54] Speaker_D | Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire ."
[22:54] Speaker_B | No .
[22:56] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[22:57] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
[23:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:11] Speaker_A | Okay , finance . Because um"
[23:15] Speaker_A | I received uh a spreadsheet .
[23:15] Speaker_D | A five . A five .
"[23:19] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh ."
[23:24] Speaker_D | Doesn't matter .
"[23:26] Speaker_A | I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a ."
[23:35] Speaker_A | Didn't really finish it .
"[23:37] Speaker_A | Well , we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems ."
[23:42] Speaker_D | We probably will .
"[24:04] Speaker_A | But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um yeah , we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think"
"[24:14] Speaker_D | The amount , yeah ."
[24:29] Speaker_C | Yes .
[24:39] Speaker_A | we should know how many
"[24:43] Speaker_C | Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it ."
[24:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[24:57] Speaker_D | I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really ."
"[25:00] Speaker_A | I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . But do you th you do you know what chip we need ?"
[25:00] Speaker_B | No .
[25:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:13] Speaker_C | The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe ."
[25:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:30] Speaker_D | And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ?"
"[25:32] Speaker_C | Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it ."
[25:34] Speaker_A | Maybe you can uh look it up right now .
"[25:38] Speaker_A | Okay , but okay . When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what then it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip ."
[25:43] Speaker_C | Then it's a simple chip .
"[25:49] Speaker_D | Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess ."
"[25:53] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . The sample sensor sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is ."
[25:53] Speaker_C | That will be enough for future uh recommendations .
[26:04] Speaker_C | I don't know it uh either .
[26:06] Speaker_D | I don't know .
"[26:11] Speaker_A | Okay , we went for the double-curved case"
[26:15] Speaker_C | Yes .
[26:15] Speaker_A | made out of plastic
[26:18] Speaker_A | and rubber .
[26:20] Speaker_A | And with a special colour .
"[26:23] Speaker_B | Well , special colour . ."
"[26:26] Speaker_C | Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour ."
[26:26] Speaker_D | I don't know if it's very special .
"[26:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours ."
[26:30] Speaker_B | Mm okay .
[26:30] Speaker_C | Standard rubber .
"[26:31] Speaker_D | Alright , that's okay ."
"[26:33] Speaker_A | Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ?"
[26:42] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[26:42] Speaker_A | Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet ."
[26:52] Speaker_B | No . We have the simplest buttons .
[26:55] Speaker_D | No .
[26:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:03] Speaker_A | Ah .
[27:06] Speaker_A | Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know .
[27:10] Speaker_C | Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons .
"[27:15] Speaker_B | Uh , one til nine . Is that one or is that nine buttons ?"
[27:19] Speaker_A | And I count them like this .
"[27:22] Speaker_A | One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . Because Oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um"
[27:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:36] Speaker_D | To n that's total of four buttons .
"[27:37] Speaker_A | as uh uh uh separate buttons . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen ."
"[27:37] Speaker_C | Different , yes ."
"[27:45] Speaker_D | Eighteen . One two three four five , si"
[27:48] Speaker_C | Why is that so uh expensive .
"[27:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be"
"[27:55] Speaker_A | s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons ."
"[28:00] Speaker_B | Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ?"
[28:02] Speaker_D | Fifty cents for one single stupid button .
[28:05] Speaker_B | No way .
"[28:07] Speaker_A | Well , okay , well well let's make it just one ."
"[28:11] Speaker_A | Here , now it's now it's already s shall we just"
"[28:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly . Yeah ."
"[28:31] Speaker_A | And and less buttons than this isn't possible . This is the most simple yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before ."
"[28:34] Speaker_B | No , no no ."
[28:36] Speaker_C | But whe
"[28:39] Speaker_D | No , really ."
"[28:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible ."
"[28:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , we could skip the numbers ."
"[28:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really ."
[28:49] Speaker_B | That's still four .
"[28:49] Speaker_C | Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo"
[28:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[28:53] Speaker_A | Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible ."
"[28:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's no option , that's no option ."
"[28:58] Speaker_A | Okay , we'll we'll just okay . But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess ."
[29:23] Speaker_B | But wha what s what special ?
"[29:26] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
[29:28] Speaker_D | I don't think the special form is really true .
"[29:28] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah ."
"[29:35] Speaker_C | Special form also , it says ."
"[29:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , special material r also , because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber ."
[29:37] Speaker_D | Is it ?
[29:43] Speaker_C | What is the normal material ?
"[29:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , I dunno ."
[29:46] Speaker_B | Plastic .
"[29:47] Speaker_B | Plastic , I think ."
"[29:49] Speaker_C | Classic ? Oh , plastic ."
[29:50] Speaker_B | Plastic .
[29:50] Speaker_D | Plastic .
"[29:56] Speaker_A | There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents ."
[30:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:11] Speaker_A | Separately .
[30:11] Speaker_B | Se no no no .
[30:31] Speaker_D | No .
"[30:32] Speaker_C | No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it ."
"[30:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents ."
[30:41] Speaker_A | I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked .
"[30:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , yep ."
"[30:50] Speaker_C | But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station ."
"[30:51] Speaker_D | I think so , too ."
"[30:54] Speaker_D | Oh , I don't know ."
"[30:56] Speaker_A | But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip ."
[31:16] Speaker_C | For two Euros .
[31:17] Speaker_A | We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .
"[31:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , well who knows . Or a little bit of tin titanium ."
"[31:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea ."
[31:35] Speaker_B | But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?
"[31:37] Speaker_A | Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . Maybe is that that's nice to know ."
[31:43] Speaker_B | If if i
"[31:49] Speaker_B | Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example ."
"[31:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature ."
[31:56] Speaker_D | I like the hand dynamo part .
[32:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[32:17] Speaker_A | It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material ."
"[32:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean ,"
"[32:31] Speaker_D | it has a shape . Of course it has a shape , but i i"
"[32:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , then two Euros isn't even possible ."
[32:41] Speaker_D | Why should that not be possible ?
"[32:43] Speaker_A | Yeah , then because then we'd thirty cents left ."
"[32:47] Speaker_D | No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip ."
"[32:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , but yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip ."
"[32:56] Speaker_B | That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f"
[33:00] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[33:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , and w and and we uh need f and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker ."
"[33:01] Speaker_C | It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . It isn't in my information , I uh I I've got a"
[33:19] Speaker_A | You can look at it for s presentation .
[33:25] Speaker_A | S technical functions ?
[33:26] Speaker_B | No .
[33:27] Speaker_C | Uh I've got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it .
"[33:28] Speaker_B | No no , they were uh mine , yeah ."
[33:30] Speaker_A | Oh .
[33:33] Speaker_C | When my mouse works again .
"[33:41] Speaker_A | Oh , oh oh ."
[33:46] Speaker_A | Hey .
[33:48] Speaker_A | Oh .
[33:52] Speaker_D | Dead .
[33:53] Speaker_C | Yes .
[33:53] Speaker_D | Reanimate it .
[33:54] Speaker_C | Oh .
[33:55] Speaker_B | Died .
"[33:58] Speaker_C | Ah , I've got it . I will put uh"
[34:01] Speaker_C | my email on the
[34:05] Speaker_C | the network .
[34:14] Speaker_D | What the hell are these ?
[34:15] Speaker_C | It's on it .
"[34:18] Speaker_D | Oh , whatever ."
"[34:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's open ."
[34:40] Speaker_A | Mm .
[34:42] Speaker_A | I don't think here it's in here already .
[34:43] Speaker_B | It's circuit board .
[35:06] Speaker_A | It's nothing about s yeah .
[35:09] Speaker_C | Yes .
[35:10] Speaker_B | At the end circuit there is an infrared LED .
[35:10] Speaker_D | This isn't helpful .
[35:12] Speaker_A | No .
"[35:15] Speaker_A | But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ?"
[35:21] Speaker_B | Components design .
[35:22] Speaker_A | Functional requirements ?
"[35:25] Speaker_D | No , that was my presentation ."
[35:26] Speaker_B | Components design maybe .
[35:28] Speaker_B | N on top .
"[35:28] Speaker_C | Yes , that was mine ."
[35:29] Speaker_A | Ah .
"[35:31] Speaker_A | Ah yes , it was the second one ."
[35:35] Speaker_D | It's already open .
"[35:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , it was your second your first presentation ."
[35:38] Speaker_D | It's at the bottom .
[35:40] Speaker_B | Working design .
[35:40] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[35:41] Speaker_D | It's uh at your task bar .
"[35:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's the the other one ."
[35:46] Speaker_D | Oh .
[35:47] Speaker_B | Was it working design or components design ?
"[35:47] Speaker_A | Uh , this is n this is not this n that's not the right one . I don't oh ."
[35:48] Speaker_D | Sorry .
"[35:52] Speaker_D | Okay , sorry ."
[36:05] Speaker_B | Chip set .
[36:09] Speaker_C | This is o only the possibilities .
[36:12] Speaker_A | Here .
[36:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[36:16] Speaker_C | We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip ."
"[36:19] Speaker_D | Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything ."
[36:22] Speaker_B | The display requires an advanced chip .
"[36:23] Speaker_A | You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires Okay , so we only need a simple chip ."
"[36:27] Speaker_C | Ah , okay ."
[36:30] Speaker_B | Requires .
[36:33] Speaker_C | With the light .
"[36:35] Speaker_B | Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED ."
"[36:39] Speaker_A | No no , that's just a simple chip ."
[36:41] Speaker_D | That's not needed .
"[36:42] Speaker_A | A scroll-wheel it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them ."
[36:52] Speaker_C | L_C_D_ .
[36:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[36:55] Speaker_B | No .
[36:59] Speaker_B | I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay .
"[37:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
[37:03] Speaker_A | And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?
"[37:10] Speaker_C | Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down ."
[37:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[37:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , I guess so too ."
"[37:17] Speaker_B | Yeah , true ."
[37:19] Speaker_D | Next channel .
"[37:19] Speaker_B | Well , that's not too what we want ."
[37:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
[37:27] Speaker_A | Back to the costs .
[37:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:30] Speaker_C | Twelve Euros and fifty cents .
[37:32] Speaker_A | So we're gonna use the simple chip .
"[37:33] Speaker_B | So , simple chip is okay ."
[37:35] Speaker_D | Great . Delete . Yeah .
[37:37] Speaker_C | And the lights . Where uh are the lights ?
"[37:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no"
"[37:41] Speaker_D | Well , there're three , I guess ."
[37:42] Speaker_B | category .
"[37:47] Speaker_A | Nah , there is some money left to be spent ."
[37:50] Speaker_B | Can we do it wi within two two Euro ?
[37:51] Speaker_D | I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .
"[37:53] Speaker_A | Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something ."
[38:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[38:13] Speaker_B | But it's original .
"[38:16] Speaker_D | No , that's true ."
[38:29] Speaker_D | M bu
"[38:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I they will think about that . I mean if you u"
[38:40] Speaker_C | Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .
[38:51] Speaker_C | Uh solar cells are useless .
[39:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[39:21] Speaker_A | Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . I've never seen it before in a remote control ."
"[39:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , but but if we ca"
[39:29] Speaker_B | But then we could make a docking station .
[39:33] Speaker_D | Five minutes .
"[39:33] Speaker_A | No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway ."
[39:37] Speaker_D | That's not true .
[39:40] Speaker_D | We can make a docking station for two thirty .
"[39:40] Speaker_B | Wow , w why no li Look at now , we got two"
[39:44] Speaker_D | Two thirty .
"[39:44] Speaker_C | Fo for a docking station . With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it ."
[39:45] Speaker_B | two thirty left . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ?
[39:46] Speaker_D | We can make a docking station . Sure .
[39:51] Speaker_D | Sure .
[39:53] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[39:53] Speaker_D | The power device is is i i is very cheap . That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever .
"[39:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control ."
[40:03] Speaker_D | So .
"[40:03] Speaker_C | wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . Uh , so it's uh wireless technology ."
[40:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[40:17] Speaker_A | I don't think it's realistic for you to do so .
"[40:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things ."
"[40:26] Speaker_A | We well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It th this is whole concept . Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing ."
[40:38] Speaker_D | Can't we say fifteen Euros ?
"[40:44] Speaker_C | No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros ."
[40:46] Speaker_D | No .
"[40:48] Speaker_B | No , we only make less profit of it ."
[40:51] Speaker_D | You can sell for twenty seven and a half .
[40:54] Speaker_D | Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs .
"[41:06] Speaker_A | Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic ,"
"[41:11] Speaker_A | because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control ."
[41:13] Speaker_C | Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .
[41:21] Speaker_D | No .
"[41:21] Speaker_A | No , that wouldn't n no ."
[41:23] Speaker_D | Thirteen twenty .
"[41:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore ."
"[41:32] Speaker_C | Yes , but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty ."
[41:34] Speaker_A | No no .
"[41:38] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's great ."
"[41:38] Speaker_D | You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really ."
[41:46] Speaker_C | You asked for three d
"[41:50] Speaker_C | No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time ."
[41:52] Speaker_D | No .
[41:53] Speaker_A | It We can make it yeah no . Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it
"[42:00] Speaker_C | Yes , solar cells are also stated ."
"[42:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells ."
[42:07] Speaker_C | Why don't we use solar cells then ?
[42:25] Speaker_C | That's true .
"[42:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating ."
"[42:40] Speaker_D | No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously ."
[42:42] Speaker_C | Oui .
"[42:54] Speaker_A | We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out ."
"[43:02] Speaker_D | Well , we've got more than fifty Cents ."
[43:03] Speaker_C | The c The case the case alone is is is uh
"[43:04] Speaker_A | Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , because uh we only have a minute left or so ."
[43:08] Speaker_C | the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro .
[43:14] Speaker_C | Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .
"[43:16] Speaker_A | No no , it's not possible ."
"[43:18] Speaker_A | Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready ."
[43:26] Speaker_B | Cheap remote control .
"[43:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , we make some extra profit of it ."
"[43:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . No , we won't , but that's um something else . No , this not gonna sell . No ."
"[43:38] Speaker_A | Huh , any ideas ?"
[43:40] Speaker_D | Of course not .
"[43:43] Speaker_B | No , uh , n no"
[43:44] Speaker_C | Great . It's great .
"[43:47] Speaker_B | Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over ."
[43:47] Speaker_C | Our remote control .
"[43:53] Speaker_D | We come back tomorrow , okay ?"
[43:55] Speaker_A | No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel .
[43:55] Speaker_C | Yes .

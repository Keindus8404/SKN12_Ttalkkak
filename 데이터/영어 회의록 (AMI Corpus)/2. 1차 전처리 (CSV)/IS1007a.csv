[00:42] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[01:12] Speaker_A | Good morning everybody .
[01:15] Speaker_D | Good morning .
"[01:17] Speaker_A | So , we are asked to"
[01:23] Speaker_A | to make uh uh a new remote control for television .
[01:32] Speaker_A | And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and
[01:44] Speaker_A | trendy and of course user user friendly .
[01:49] Speaker_A | So people can can use it without any
[01:55] Speaker_A | any problem .
[02:14] Speaker_A | I don't know .
"[02:18] Speaker_C | Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh"
[02:22] Speaker_B | Mm .
[02:23] Speaker_B | B did you send us an email about this ?
[02:34] Speaker_A | Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ?
[02:41] Speaker_D | Or you can put it in the shared folder .
"[02:44] Speaker_B | Yeah , you see the email ? You email . The v very no , no the first one . It's inside ."
"[02:47] Speaker_D | No , I didn't get it ."
[02:52] Speaker_D | This one . No .
"[02:53] Speaker_B | No , no . The third one ."
"[02:57] Speaker_B | Oh , you didn't get anything ."
"[02:58] Speaker_D | No , ."
[03:00] Speaker_B | It's strange .
"[03:12] Speaker_B | I dunno from who . From the account manager . You have received the same email , right ? Yeah ."
"[03:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , from the account manager ."
[03:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:19] Speaker_D | I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .
[03:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[03:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think so ."
"[03:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , so each of us has a role to do ."
[03:28] Speaker_D | Yeah I think assign your uh roles .
[03:31] Speaker_A | For each for each one .
[03:32] Speaker_B | We already have our role .
"[03:33] Speaker_D | For each person , yeah ."
"[03:36] Speaker_A | So there are so we have three f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design ."
"[03:36] Speaker_B | So there are three kinds of designs , that's all ."
"[03:44] Speaker_A | So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ?"
[03:51] Speaker_C | I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager .
[03:59] Speaker_B | I'm doing the interface .
[04:01] Speaker_A | You are doing th
"[04:11] Speaker_C | Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design ."
[04:17] Speaker_C | It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright .
[04:22] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[04:22] Speaker_A | Okay , I'll for industrial design ."
[04:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:33] Speaker_A | Norman ?
[04:39] Speaker_C | User .
"[04:57] Speaker_D | Uh , I'm into marketing . yeah nothing much in the project ."
[05:07] Speaker_D | Marketing in this design . A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface .
[05:09] Speaker_B | Yes .
[05:18] Speaker_B | You see the second mail ?
"[05:22] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's inside . Go down ."
[05:26] Speaker_B | Appendix .
"[05:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , this is ."
[05:28] Speaker_B | See there's a role for everybody .
"[05:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right , first ."
[05:31] Speaker_B | Even for the marketing .
"[05:35] Speaker_B | But look at your role , your marketing role ."
[05:35] Speaker_A | Next .
[05:42] Speaker_D | There's a trend watching .
[05:43] Speaker_A | I don't know . I .
"[05:44] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's your role ."
"[05:57] Speaker_A | Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ?"
"[06:02] Speaker_C | Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess ."
[06:11] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:11] Speaker_C | So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh
[06:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:16] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:19] Speaker_C | how we can make it work .
[06:21] Speaker_B | Yes .
[06:21] Speaker_D | I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .
[06:30] Speaker_A | What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . And of course it should not be very costly .
"[06:41] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right ."
[06:45] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:05] Speaker_A | About the about what ?
[07:07] Speaker_B | Um .
[07:18] Speaker_B | in a remote control ?
[07:20] Speaker_B | What is the most important function aspect ?
[07:24] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[07:31] Speaker_C | Well , you have to make it work . That's the that's the big thing ."
"[07:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , it should be easy to work with ."
[07:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:17] Speaker_B | Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful ."
"[08:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[08:31] Speaker_A | I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .
[08:43] Speaker_A | Like s uh you you you say we can use speech .
"[08:47] Speaker_B | You can use uh well for example anything . The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah ."
[08:56] Speaker_C | I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno
[08:59] Speaker_D | I'm a okay .
[08:59] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[09:05] Speaker_D | I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it ."
[09:09] Speaker_A | In the hand .
[09:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:19] Speaker_B | Yes , possible ."
[09:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:29] Speaker_A | Except if if you are far from the T_V_ .
"[09:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . So it's more powerful ."
[09:48] Speaker_C | On the content .
"[09:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , yeah ."
[09:52] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[09:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:59] Speaker_B | No .
"[10:03] Speaker_B | No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the to this remote control . And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons ."
[10:19] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
[10:29] Speaker_A | Mm .
[10:52] Speaker_A | Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .
"[10:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[10:56] Speaker_A | This is good idea .
[11:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:06] Speaker_B | Ah , yes . So ."
[11:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:11] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? Good idea ."
[11:14] Speaker_C | Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f
[11:17] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:37] Speaker_C | I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff
[11:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:52] Speaker_B | Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . Five minutes .
"[11:55] Speaker_A | Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we"
[12:03] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:05] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[12:06] Speaker_D | So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . The lighting in the room changes ."
[12:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , but we are designing just remote control ."
[12:17] Speaker_A | You it .
"[12:18] Speaker_D | I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote ."
[12:22] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[12:24] Speaker_B | Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? Go on , draw something ."
[12:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the .
"[12:41] Speaker_D | Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel ."
[12:41] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:43] Speaker_B | Where is it ?
[12:44] Speaker_A | Or before the before the the design that says .
[12:44] Speaker_D | The lapel .
"[12:45] Speaker_B | Ah , okay ."
[12:49] Speaker_B | Where where is it ? Here .
"[12:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , that one ."
[12:54] Speaker_A | Norman .
"[12:54] Speaker_D | Just plug it . Yeah , that's right ."
[12:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:56] Speaker_A | Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . Yeah .
[12:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[13:04] Speaker_B | Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ? Uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . Uh to choose"
[13:15] Speaker_C | Okay .
[13:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:33] Speaker_B | uh content s or channels . So we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ?"
"[13:44] Speaker_C | Yeah , by content or by channel , it's a good idea ."
[13:55] Speaker_B | And then what did we say just now ?
[13:58] Speaker_B | Other than this .
[14:00] Speaker_C | And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .
[14:00] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[14:03] Speaker_B | Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content ."
[14:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:14] Speaker_B | Challenge .
[14:34] Speaker_C | I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh
[14:35] Speaker_B | The main thing .
[14:37] Speaker_B | Okay . Alright .
[14:39] Speaker_C | reflect about it and uh
"[14:40] Speaker_B | Alright , okay . So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . Right ."
[14:41] Speaker_C | discuss it in the next meeting .
[14:55] Speaker_B | We will get information and then we'll come back in .
[15:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[15:03] Speaker_B | Yeah , we'll come ."
[15:03] Speaker_A | Okay . So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ?
[15:10] Speaker_A | And we'll discuss the other other aspects .
[15:11] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[15:12] Speaker_B | Alright , okay ."

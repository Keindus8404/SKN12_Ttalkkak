[02:14] Speaker_D | Mm .
[02:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[02:29] Speaker_A | So , hope you have good ideas . I don't . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera ."
[02:34] Speaker_C | Not yet .
[02:46] Speaker_A | And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
[02:51] Speaker_A | Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
[03:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[03:09] Speaker_A | Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um

[09:36] Speaker_A | Yeah . Alright .
[09:43] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:52] Speaker_C | Alright . Yeah .
[10:06] Speaker_A | the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
[10:17] Speaker_A | And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
[10:25] Speaker_C | So we have to s
[10:26] Speaker_A | Okay now it's time for some discussion .
[10:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:47] Speaker_B | Yep .
[10:50] Speaker_A | Uh I'm taking notes . Um
[10:52] Speaker_D | Okay . Great .
"[10:56] Speaker_A | we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah ? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?"
[11:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[11:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:04] Speaker_C | I guess so . Yeah .
[11:16] Speaker_C | True .
[11:16] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
[11:24] Speaker_B | Yep .
[11:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[11:51] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[11:56] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:02] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
"[12:03] Speaker_C | well how I have to fill it . Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points ."
[12:09] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:16] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[12:22] Speaker_C | Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . And that's basically all I have so far ."
[12:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:36] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Okay .
[12:40] Speaker_A | Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
[12:44] Speaker_B | Yeah . Wireless uh huh .
[12:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:47] Speaker_C | Alright .
[12:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:50] Speaker_D | So that's very common .
[12:51] Speaker_B | Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
[13:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:02] Speaker_B | That are the the basic options for a remote control .
"[13:10] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
[13:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:17] Speaker_B | Yep .
[13:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:22] Speaker_A | Same I believe .
[13:27] Speaker_A | Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
"[13:30] Speaker_D | Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . I mean , what functions do they have . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?"
[13:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[13:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[13:54] Speaker_A | Mm .
[13:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:02] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[14:03] Speaker_D | Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? So we can see uh what needs to be supported ."
[14:08] Speaker_A | Yep .
[14:18] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[14:22] Speaker_D | Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add ."
[14:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:31] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:45] Speaker_A | Okay . And you can get that information ?
"[14:48] Speaker_D | I think I can get that information , yeah ."
[14:49] Speaker_A | Okay . That would be very handy . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
[14:51] Speaker_D | So yeah .
[15:00] Speaker_A | No ?
[15:01] Speaker_A | No okay .
[15:03] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[15:04] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[15:05] Speaker_C | Yeah . Obviously .
[15:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:28] Speaker_A | Big , mm-hmm ."
[15:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:45] Speaker_D | From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah .
[15:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:54] Speaker_A | Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
[16:04] Speaker_A | I think the best is to go to work .
[16:07] Speaker_C | Whoa . Is that you or alright .
[16:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:15] Speaker_D | Any more points to discuss ?
[16:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think
[16:19] Speaker_A | we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
"[16:29] Speaker_A | Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email ."
[16:40] Speaker_D | Alright .
[16:40] Speaker_A | So that was it for me .
[16:40] Speaker_C | Alright .
[16:42] Speaker_B | Okay .
[16:45] Speaker_D | 'Kay . Thanks .
"[16:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . I'm writing very fast . Hope it's readable . Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?"
[16:49] Speaker_D | Yeah . The pro okay .
[16:51] Speaker_C | Alright .
[16:54] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay .
[16:56] Speaker_D | Uh .
[16:56] Speaker_B | Yep .
[16:58] Speaker_D | I guess so .
[17:01] Speaker_C | Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
"[17:07] Speaker_B | Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?"
[17:08] Speaker_C | session ?
"[17:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . I depend on you ."
[17:15] Speaker_D | Yeah . We're just working the three phases .
[17:28] Speaker_C | Yeah okay . We'll do our best .
[17:29] Speaker_B | Okay .
[17:34] Speaker_A | Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay .
[17:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[17:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:50] Speaker_A | Well I think that is the user
[17:53] Speaker_D | Requirements . Yeah .
[17:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . True .
[17:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:00] Speaker_C | But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard ."
[18:00] Speaker_D | Unit .
[18:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:06] Speaker_B | I would first m
[18:09] Speaker_A | Yeah I understand .
[18:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah .
[18:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:26] Speaker_A | Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah ."
[18:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:40] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[18:42] Speaker_C | Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need ."
[18:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:50] Speaker_D | Yeah records and stuff like that .
[18:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:54] Speaker_D | No .
[18:58] Speaker_A | You need additional yeah .
[18:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:06] Speaker_C | Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh"
[19:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:10] Speaker_C | in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
[19:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .
[19:16] Speaker_C | meeting .
[19:23] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:29] Speaker_B | Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't it's yeah .
[19:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:29] Speaker_C | Alright .
[19:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:37] Speaker_B | Okay .
[19:39] Speaker_C | Yeah . I understand . Yeah .
[19:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:41] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
[19:42] Speaker_C | Alright .
[19:42] Speaker_D | Yes .
[19:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:48] Speaker_D | Half an hour .
[19:55] Speaker_C | Alright .
[19:56] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:56] Speaker_D | Alright let's move on .

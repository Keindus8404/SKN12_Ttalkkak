"[00:23] Speaker_A | Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting ."
[00:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[00:48] Speaker_A | So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes ."
[00:58] Speaker_D | Uh Rama .
[01:17] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[01:55] Speaker_A | So , let's go . First"
[02:00] Speaker_A | with Rama .
[02:08] Speaker_A | Participant two .
"[02:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , participant two ."
[02:13] Speaker_C | Component .
[02:14] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[02:19] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[02:21] Speaker_C | So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some , moving kind of thing ."
[02:50] Speaker_D | Ah .
"[03:17] Speaker_C | So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control ."
"[03:29] Speaker_C | So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house ."
"[04:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm , okay ."
[04:26] Speaker_C | So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .
[04:32] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[04:52] Speaker_D | What is a double-curved shape ?
[04:57] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[04:59] Speaker_B | Why ?
[05:00] Speaker_C | Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic .
"[05:09] Speaker_C | So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost ."
[05:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:30] Speaker_D | The cost .
[05:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:01] Speaker_D | Mm like this ?
[06:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:07] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:07] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[06:18] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:28] Speaker_A | Uh yeah so
"[06:44] Speaker_A | Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated ."
[06:47] Speaker_C | S S
[06:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:55] Speaker_B | Okay , and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ ."
[07:00] Speaker_D | L_C_D_ .
[07:02] Speaker_C | Uh l
"[07:02] Speaker_D | Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button ."
"[07:04] Speaker_B | No , it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus ."
[07:11] Speaker_D | Ah .
[07:11] Speaker_C | Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter
"[07:20] Speaker_B | Okay , so let's try it , let's t"
"[07:31] Speaker_D | The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . Just uh for output , yeah ."
"[07:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information ."
[07:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:48] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:50] Speaker_C | Okay , yep . You have any further questions or ?"
[07:55] Speaker_D | I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .
[07:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for"
[08:08] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[08:13] Speaker_C | really light batteries and with uh good price .
"[08:17] Speaker_D | So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask ."
[08:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[09:01] Speaker_A | Okay , for the location ."
[09:03] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[09:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something ."
[09:10] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:18] Speaker_A | So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? Um mm thank you mm .
"[09:21] Speaker_D | No , it's okay . Puts less of constraint on what we can do but"
[09:21] Speaker_B | No more questions .
[09:22] Speaker_C | Yep . Thank you .
"[09:25] Speaker_B | Mm yeah , yeah ."
[09:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , but mm ."
[09:33] Speaker_D | Anyway .
"[09:36] Speaker_B | But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , L_C_ I'm an artist , sorry . So uh , that's not I hope that's not too much . Okay . Uh participant number three ."
[09:58] Speaker_A | Three .
[09:58] Speaker_C | Three .
[10:05] Speaker_B | mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah .
[10:24] Speaker_B | possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here
"[10:56] Speaker_B | and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control ."
[11:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:33] Speaker_D | Oh no , too much concept ."
[11:37] Speaker_D | Ah .
[11:38] Speaker_A | No .
"[11:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . But instead of this I will devise That's our concept ."
"[11:51] Speaker_B | And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already"
[11:59] Speaker_B | we already discussed . And uh what will people say ?
[12:00] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
[12:05] Speaker_B | They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . And everyone's gonna be satisfied .
[12:16] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:21] Speaker_D | Do you think it can come in several colours ?
[12:32] Speaker_D | Um but not the case .
[12:33] Speaker_B | Not the case .
[12:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:39] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:39] Speaker_A | Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?"
[12:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:48] Speaker_B | Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels ."
"[12:53] Speaker_D | Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , but"
[12:54] Speaker_B | Do you like it ?
[13:11] Speaker_B | No .
[13:14] Speaker_C | Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this
[13:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:26] Speaker_C | uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
"[13:31] Speaker_B | Um , I am here ."
[13:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:40] Speaker_A | So ?
[13:40] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:40] Speaker_C | So we can just if they want they can just pay another
"[13:44] Speaker_A | Uh-huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , yeah ."
[13:44] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[13:44] Speaker_C | two Euro .
[13:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:49] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh so that we can yeah .
"[13:53] Speaker_D | Kind of upgradable uh remote control . Wow , wow ."
[13:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:57] Speaker_C | Just they'll get few more
[14:00] Speaker_C | things and few more colours .
"[14:01] Speaker_B | Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours"
"[14:15] Speaker_C | Lights , yeah ."
[14:16] Speaker_D | Mm .
[14:17] Speaker_A | And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .
"[14:17] Speaker_B | depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah ."
[14:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:20] Speaker_D | Like a chameleon .
[14:22] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:22] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
[14:24] Speaker_B | We can make it in fact . If if if the okay .
[14:25] Speaker_C | Mm .
[14:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[14:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:33] Speaker_D | Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh
[14:39] Speaker_D | is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . And that makes me special .
[14:58] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:58] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[15:12] Speaker_A | Okay , so"
[15:14] Speaker_D | Those who wanted to have it pink .
[15:18] Speaker_D | No mm no .
[15:18] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[15:19] Speaker_B | So , be an option , yeah ."
[15:20] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[15:20] Speaker_D | It might be optional , yeah ."
[15:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:28] Speaker_C | Ah .
[15:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[15:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:32] Speaker_A | So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .
[15:37] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah .
[15:55] Speaker_D | Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .
[16:01] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[16:04] Speaker_A | Mm .
[16:11] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[16:18] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?"
[16:18] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[16:19] Speaker_D | Seems important .
[16:22] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[16:24] Speaker_B | That they can use it in darkness , like ."
"[16:27] Speaker_B | Hand light , yeah ."
[16:28] Speaker_C | Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some
[16:36] Speaker_A | Iradium ? Ah sorry . Mm .
[16:48] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[16:49] Speaker_B | Okay . S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation . And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?"
[16:53] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[16:55] Speaker_C | Oh .
[17:04] Speaker_B | And uh
[17:13] Speaker_D | Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
[17:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[17:31] Speaker_B | Okay , okay ."
[17:39] Speaker_A | Okay .
[17:53] Speaker_B | Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .
[18:04] Speaker_D | Mm .
[18:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:06] Speaker_B | 'Cause I ordered jus
[18:09] Speaker_D | Mm .
[18:09] Speaker_B | To l to l lock it .
[18:14] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:14] Speaker_C | So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah .
[18:20] Speaker_D | So it could be
[18:21] Speaker_D | smart in that way .
[18:24] Speaker_A | Mm .
[18:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[18:27] Speaker_D | But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but"
[18:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , sure ."
[18:48] Speaker_A | Mm .
[18:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:56] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:59] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[19:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[19:07] Speaker_B | Okay , thanks ."
[19:11] Speaker_D | My turn ?
"[19:19] Speaker_D | Okay , it's alright ."
"[19:20] Speaker_A | Participant two ? Four , sorry ."
[19:21] Speaker_C | Four .
"[19:22] Speaker_D | Four , I think . Trend , yeah ."
[19:29] Speaker_D | No uh yes .
"[19:35] Speaker_D | Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to"
"[20:06] Speaker_D | to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired ."
"[20:36] Speaker_D | Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . So anyway uh next slide please ."
"[21:33] Speaker_D | Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours ."
[22:25] Speaker_D | And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . Next slide please .
[22:35] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[22:36] Speaker_D | Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . Well this so so I think uh uh i"
[23:34] Speaker_C | Mm .
[23:34] Speaker_B | What is spongy ?
"[23:43] Speaker_D | When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess ."
[23:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[23:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:53] Speaker_A | So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
"[23:56] Speaker_D | Seems not , seems not ."
[23:58] Speaker_C | We need to think about mm mm .
[23:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:05] Speaker_D | Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh"
[24:09] Speaker_C | Fruit .
[24:12] Speaker_C | Even shape ?
[24:18] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
[24:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:24] Speaker_D | And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
[24:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:31] Speaker_C | Mm .
[24:42] Speaker_B | Okay .
[24:45] Speaker_A | Okay .
[24:46] Speaker_D | Okay that's all I have to say .
[24:48] Speaker_A | Mm you have questions ?
[24:56] Speaker_D | These I'm sorry .
"[25:00] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well ."
[25:03] Speaker_C | Where ?
"[25:05] Speaker_C | Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . It's not from mm ."
[25:11] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[25:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:18] Speaker_C | Yeah . It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .
[25:26] Speaker_C | Mm .
[25:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:30] Speaker_C | Yeah but some materials n they're to be
[25:34] Speaker_C | uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah .
[25:45] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah that yeah yeah . Yeah .
"[25:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , looking yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah ."
"[25:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good ."
[26:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:05] Speaker_A | Mm .
[26:06] Speaker_C | Mm .
[26:07] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[26:08] Speaker_D | Okay ?
[26:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:12] Speaker_A | No more question ?
[26:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:16] Speaker_D | Yep . Thanks .
"[26:30] Speaker_A | Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay ."
[26:42] Speaker_C | Look and feel de
[26:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:56] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[27:01] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[27:03] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm um
[27:07] Speaker_A | and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
[27:15] Speaker_D | Okay .
[27:16] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[27:20] Speaker_C | So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend ."
[27:36] Speaker_A | So you say s
[27:38] Speaker_D | Spongy .
[27:40] Speaker_A | S do we agree on that ? Yeah .
[27:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:45] Speaker_A | We have to .
[27:51] Speaker_C | Hmm . Yeah .
[27:55] Speaker_B | yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
[27:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:00] Speaker_D | Well , that's you t can try to convince us ."
"[28:09] Speaker_A | Okay , that's a good idea . So titanium smell like fruit . Mm-hmm ."
[28:34] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[28:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:45] Speaker_A | Okay .
[28:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:56] Speaker_A | Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy"
[29:04] Speaker_A | uh fruity-like
[29:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:06] Speaker_C | Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah .
[29:07] Speaker_D | Maybe you could explore the two option .
"[29:08] Speaker_A | Mm . Yeah , yeah ."
"[29:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ?"
[29:14] Speaker_B | I mean fruit-shaped .
[29:22] Speaker_B | Doub double-curved .
[29:22] Speaker_D | Mm . Seems to be .
[29:22] Speaker_C | yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d
[29:26] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Okay .
"[29:28] Speaker_B | Okay , okay ."
[29:33] Speaker_B | In fact I just agreed to make uh
[29:36] Speaker_B | to make the like titanium panels
[29:39] Speaker_B | on a whole
[29:42] Speaker_B | rubber body .
[29:44] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[29:45] Speaker_B | Well , okay w we'll see ."
[29:50] Speaker_C | Mm .
[30:01] Speaker_A | Mm .
[30:05] Speaker_B | We'll see . We'll see .
[30:05] Speaker_D | If you have time .
[30:06] Speaker_A | Mm .
[30:08] Speaker_A | Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose .
[30:11] Speaker_A | If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both .
[30:11] Speaker_C | Uh .
[30:14] Speaker_B | We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look .
[30:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:32] Speaker_B | Okay , okay ."
"[30:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , do don't worry , you you you speak with mm mm ."
"[30:40] Speaker_B | Alright , alright ."
[30:43] Speaker_A | Okay . So explore a shape .
[30:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:00] Speaker_D | The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
[31:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
[31:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .

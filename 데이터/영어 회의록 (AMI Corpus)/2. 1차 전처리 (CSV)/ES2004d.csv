[00:03] Speaker_B | If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
[00:13] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[00:15] Speaker_D | Is that someone's ?
[00:19] Speaker_B | Is that .
[00:22] Speaker_A | Thank you .
[00:25] Speaker_A | Hmm . Hmm .
"[00:27] Speaker_B | Okay , you all switched on ."
[00:27] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[00:28] Speaker_A | Yep , me too ."
"[00:32] Speaker_B | I presume we're good to go . Okay , um"
"[00:36] Speaker_B | minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,"
[00:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[00:40] Speaker_B | standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh"
"[00:47] Speaker_B | uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ?"
[01:28] Speaker_B | Prototype presentation .
[01:30] Speaker_C | Is that for us ?
[01:32] Speaker_B | I think that would be you .
[01:32] Speaker_A | Yep .
[01:33] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[01:34] Speaker_A | Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that ."
[01:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[01:48] Speaker_B | Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out ."
[01:54] Speaker_C | Whoa .
[01:55] Speaker_A | It looks
[01:56] Speaker_C | Going a bit crazy over here .
[01:57] Speaker_A | crazy .
[01:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[02:00] Speaker_C | Thank you .
[02:04] Speaker_A | Um not now .
[02:07] Speaker_A | Oh .
[02:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[02:17] Speaker_C | Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um"
[02:19] Speaker_B | Right .
[02:21] Speaker_B | Mm 'kay .
[02:30] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[02:32] Speaker_C | It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um"
[02:33] Speaker_A | You able to look ?
[02:35] Speaker_A | Yep .
[02:48] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[03:29] Speaker_B | Mm . So it's flush .
[03:30] Speaker_A | Right .
"[03:34] Speaker_B | Oh right , okay , yeah ."
"[03:53] Speaker_B | So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay ."
"[03:55] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and"
[03:55] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[04:19] Speaker_C | it'll shout back , I'm here , or something ."
[04:31] Speaker_B | Okay . I'm under the sofa .
[04:31] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[04:34] Speaker_A | Ah oka
"[04:34] Speaker_B | Or , that would be too complicated ."
[04:51] Speaker_B | Infrared .
"[05:19] Speaker_C | um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on ."
[05:29] Speaker_B | Like here .
"[05:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , something like that ."
"[05:32] Speaker_B | Okay . Actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you ."
"[05:32] Speaker_A | Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here ."
"[05:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah ."
"[05:39] Speaker_B | It's still pointing , yes ."
"[05:39] Speaker_C | So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . And then finally um on to the interface . The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would"
"[05:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , that would make sense ."
[05:56] Speaker_A | This one right here .
"[05:59] Speaker_C | uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled"
[06:15] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[06:32] Speaker_C | uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top ."
"[06:40] Speaker_C | No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo ."
[06:40] Speaker_A | No .
[06:44] Speaker_A | Look up to it .
[06:45] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:53] Speaker_B | Thank you very much .
[06:55] Speaker_A | Yay .
"[06:56] Speaker_B | Wrapping it all up , okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria ."
[06:56] Speaker_D | Well done .
[07:02] Speaker_D | Certainly .
[07:03] Speaker_A | So this is the one . Sorry .
[07:06] Speaker_B | It's to be presented . Okay .
[07:08] Speaker_C | There you go . .
[07:08] Speaker_D | Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .
[07:18] Speaker_A | Evaluation .
[07:28] Speaker_A | Mm um I I think this is chip .
"[07:31] Speaker_B | It's quite similar to what it was before , though ."
"[07:34] Speaker_D | Okay . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?"
[07:35] Speaker_B | Sorry .
[08:24] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[08:45] Speaker_D | Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?"
[09:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[09:10] Speaker_A | Ah , it's perfect ."
[09:12] Speaker_D | So we're going to look at these crite
"[09:13] Speaker_A | Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market okay ."
"[09:15] Speaker_D | Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Is that okay ? One is true , seven is false ."
[09:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:21] Speaker_B | Okay .
[09:22] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[09:50] Speaker_D | and rating .
"[09:55] Speaker_D | Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who ."
[10:00] Speaker_B | Yeah . That works .
"[10:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[10:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:07] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[10:15] Speaker_D | Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two ."
[10:32] Speaker_D | One is true and seven is false .
[10:38] Speaker_D | I'll just go this way .
"[10:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . No , three . Three ."
[10:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
[10:39] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[10:44] Speaker_D | Two .
[10:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
[10:49] Speaker_B | I would say two .
[10:50] Speaker_D | Two .
"[10:54] Speaker_D | A four , okay . Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . Two and three quarters ?"
[11:02] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
[11:03] Speaker_A | Almost three .
[11:07] Speaker_A | I think yeah .
"[11:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[11:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[11:11] Speaker_D | Two point seven five , there we go . Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative ."
[11:20] Speaker_D | I would give that a three .
[11:26] Speaker_C | I'd give it a one .
[11:27] Speaker_D | Okay . Not that you're biased in that it the designer .
"[11:29] Speaker_C | No , no , not at all ."
[11:36] Speaker_B | A two .
"[11:38] Speaker_A | Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ?"
"[11:45] Speaker_A | The first . Yeah , I I just it the other way ."
"[11:45] Speaker_D | The average oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ?"
[11:50] Speaker_D | Is that what you're saying ? Okay .
"[11:59] Speaker_D | Okay , and we're just waiting for your rating f"
[12:00] Speaker_A | two point f
[12:00] Speaker_B | It's just two point five for that one .
"[12:03] Speaker_D | Two point five , okay ."
[12:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:07] Speaker_D | Losing one decimal place , that's okay ."
"[12:08] Speaker_A | One is a , seven is false , okay ."
"[12:10] Speaker_D | So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? Two , okay ."
[12:12] Speaker_A | Two .
"[12:15] Speaker_D | So that is eight . That brings it down to two , nice and simple , yeah ."
[12:18] Speaker_C | Two .
"[12:21] Speaker_D | Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ?"
"[12:25] Speaker_D | Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true ."
[12:33] Speaker_C | Two .
[12:33] Speaker_D | Two .
[12:38] Speaker_B | I would say a two . I would say a two .
"[12:40] Speaker_D | A two , okay ."
[12:43] Speaker_A | Two .
[12:44] Speaker_D | Two .
"[12:46] Speaker_D | I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . Okay . Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours ."
"[12:52] Speaker_B | One point seven f five . Okay , mm-hmm ."
[12:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:59] Speaker_C | D_ .
[13:05] Speaker_C | One .
[13:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:14] Speaker_D | Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?"
"[13:23] Speaker_C | No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised ."
[13:26] Speaker_A | White . With for the plastic ? Uh blue .
[13:30] Speaker_D | Right .
[13:38] Speaker_D | So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Okay . And the spongy feel is no problem with that .
[13:41] Speaker_A | Right .
[13:42] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:42] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[13:45] Speaker_C | No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic ."
[13:50] Speaker_A | Because of the rubber case .
[13:52] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:54] Speaker_D | In that case it's got to be a one for me .
"[13:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'll give it a one as well ."
[13:59] Speaker_D | Yep . Everybody ? Okay .
[14:00] Speaker_B | One .
[14:03] Speaker_A | One .
[14:06] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[14:14] Speaker_D | I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that"
[14:15] Speaker_C | Mm .
[14:16] Speaker_C | No .
"[14:21] Speaker_D | we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?"
[14:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:31] Speaker_B | Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to . Um"
[14:35] Speaker_C | It's meant to be .
[14:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[14:37] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[14:41] Speaker_B | maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to"
[14:47] Speaker_D | Mm .
[14:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[14:55] Speaker_D | Right .
[14:58] Speaker_D | Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
[15:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:08] Speaker_D | A five , okay ."
[15:11] Speaker_B | Four .
[15:11] Speaker_D | Four and a four okay .
[15:13] Speaker_A | Four .
[15:17] Speaker_D | Twenty one is that twenty one ? So that's four point two five .
[15:22] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[15:25] Speaker_D | And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?"
"[15:32] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , yeah ."
[15:35] Speaker_A | Voice r recognition .
"[15:37] Speaker_D | It was the I'm here thing , yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise ."
"[15:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible ."
"[15:45] Speaker_D | That sounds good then . I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ ."
[15:51] Speaker_C | Um I think it would r
"[15:51] Speaker_D | So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or ."
[15:56] Speaker_C | I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud . So it would be s p yeah .
[15:57] Speaker_B | A standard .
[16:01] Speaker_B | It would be .
[16:01] Speaker_D | Right . Okay . You built into the feature .
"[16:03] Speaker_B | And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room ."
[16:07] Speaker_D | Okay .
[16:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:08] Speaker_D | Logical . That's a one for me .
"[16:12] Speaker_D | One and one , good ."
[16:13] Speaker_B | One .
[17:01] Speaker_B | I don't think so .
"[17:02] Speaker_C | W I thin yeah , I think yeah ."
[17:03] Speaker_D | We happy to go ahead ?
[17:04] Speaker_B | I think we yeah . I think we're set .
"[17:05] Speaker_D | Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if"
"[17:13] Speaker_D | on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that ."
[17:19] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[17:20] Speaker_D | I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I"
[17:29] Speaker_D | sum up ?
[17:30] Speaker_B | Don't think so .
[17:30] Speaker_C | No .
[17:30] Speaker_D | Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . Oops .
[17:44] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[17:51] Speaker_D | Oh yes .
[17:51] Speaker_B | Um .
[17:58] Speaker_A | You want me to b unplug that ?
[18:16] Speaker_A | That's all . Yes .
[18:18] Speaker_B | Thanks .
[18:28] Speaker_B | Right .
[18:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:32] Speaker_B | Now I presume
"[18:35] Speaker_B | that the screen will go blank ,"
[18:45] Speaker_B | Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ?
[18:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:55] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[18:55] Speaker_B | Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice ."
"[19:05] Speaker_B | Right , what's happening with the electronics ?"
[19:09] Speaker_A | Chip on print .
[19:17] Speaker_B | Double-curved .
"[19:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one ."
"[19:28] Speaker_C | In the top , it's the number of c yeah ."
"[19:29] Speaker_B | Oh , right , okay ."
[19:32] Speaker_B | Thanks .
"[19:35] Speaker_B | So , would there be two ?"
[19:39] Speaker_B | One chip .
"[19:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker ."
[19:43] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:43] Speaker_B | Okay .
[19:47] Speaker_A | Yep .
[19:48] Speaker_C | And they're double curved . No . Y
[19:50] Speaker_A | Single-curved .
[19:51] Speaker_B | One double curve .
"[19:52] Speaker_C | Two , 'cause it's two ."
"[19:53] Speaker_A | Two curves , yeah ."
[19:54] Speaker_D | But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest .
[19:57] Speaker_B | So what's a single curve then ?
[19:59] Speaker_D | It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing .
[20:04] Speaker_D | Mm .
[20:04] Speaker_C | One double-curved .
"[20:06] Speaker_C | And one no , 'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's"
[20:07] Speaker_A | Plastic and rubber .
"[20:10] Speaker_D | The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah ."
[20:13] Speaker_B | Mm .
[20:17] Speaker_C | a plastic .
[20:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
[20:22] Speaker_C | And special colour .
"[20:27] Speaker_A | No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five ."
[20:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:32] Speaker_B | Do you think ?
"[20:35] Speaker_A | I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that ."
[20:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
[20:40] Speaker_D | What does it mean if you put point five for that ?
[20:42] Speaker_A | It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just
[20:46] Speaker_A | a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
"[20:50] Speaker_B | See , it says case material ."
[20:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[20:53] Speaker_B | So we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? It's including , it's including ."
"[20:57] Speaker_C | No , no , that's it's as an extra ."
"[20:59] Speaker_D | Right , okay ."
"[21:00] Speaker_C | So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get ."
"[21:07] Speaker_D | But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?"
"[21:18] Speaker_B | Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half ."
[21:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:23] Speaker_B | Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway ."
"[21:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[21:26] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[21:29] Speaker_B | No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ?"
"[21:34] Speaker_D | Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours ."
"[21:36] Speaker_B | N yeah , okay ."
[21:42] Speaker_A | Push-button .
"[21:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , the push-button's one and L_C_ display one ."
[21:44] Speaker_A | One .
[21:49] Speaker_A | One .
"[22:57] Speaker_D | Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? Is it oh , it's brought it slightly down ."
"[23:01] Speaker_B | Has that not gone up ? Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot ."
[23:01] Speaker_C | Well yes .
"[23:06] Speaker_D | So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?"
[23:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:11] Speaker_A | Uncurved , flat ."
"[23:15] Speaker_D | Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . It's gone up again ."
"[23:17] Speaker_A | No , it just surprises one ."
"[23:18] Speaker_B | Oh , it's not calculated it ."
"[23:19] Speaker_C | No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again ."
[23:19] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[23:22] Speaker_B | Okay , there we go ."
"[23:24] Speaker_C | C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . No ."
[23:38] Speaker_D | No .
[23:39] Speaker_A | Ri I think it's in Euro .
"[23:41] Speaker_B | Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here ."
[23:47] Speaker_D | If we tr um .
"[23:49] Speaker_D | If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?"
[23:53] Speaker_A | And going to a regular bat
[23:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:03] Speaker_A | What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi"
[24:05] Speaker_C | If you to
[24:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:10] Speaker_D | And people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control ."
"[24:10] Speaker_C | If if you take away the voice , I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it ."
[24:18] Speaker_A | Where's that special form ?
[24:21] Speaker_A | Mm mm mm .
[24:21] Speaker_D | Should we see what difference it makes ?
"[24:22] Speaker_C | Yeah i yeah . No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five ."
[24:22] Speaker_B | Where's the
[24:24] Speaker_B | where's the voice recognition ?
"[24:28] Speaker_B | Right , okay ."
[24:32] Speaker_B | Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three .
"[24:35] Speaker_C | They n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two ."
"[24:40] Speaker_B | Oh , right . I keep seeing zero ."
[24:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:59] Speaker_D | Sure .
"[24:59] Speaker_C | Yeah . But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product ."
[24:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[25:11] Speaker_D | But we're still working to um head o
[25:17] Speaker_B | Yes .
[25:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:26] Speaker_C | We c we could s
[25:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[25:44] Speaker_B | Okay , we can"
"[25:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , I s"
[25:52] Speaker_D | Mm .
[25:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:54] Speaker_D | 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
[25:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:07] Speaker_C | That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
[26:12] Speaker_A | Yeah we are close to the budget .
[26:14] Speaker_A | Two five .
"[26:15] Speaker_B | It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five ."
"[26:19] Speaker_D | Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there ."
"[26:21] Speaker_B | Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is"
[26:26] Speaker_D | Right . Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ?
"[26:26] Speaker_B | twenty five , isn't it ?"
"[26:27] Speaker_A | It's twelve point five maybe , then ."
[26:31] Speaker_D | Or point zero one of a Euro ? Which is less than ten P_ .
[26:52] Speaker_A | I think it is the first one .
[26:54] Speaker_D | That's today's
"[26:58] Speaker_D | kick off meeting , ."
[27:02] Speaker_B | Twelve point five .
[27:03] Speaker_D | Mm . I thought that's what it was .
[27:04] Speaker_C | Ah .
[27:04] Speaker_A | So we are under the budget .
"[27:06] Speaker_B | Well done , people ."
[27:07] Speaker_D | So we're okay .
[27:10] Speaker_C | Okay .
[27:10] Speaker_B | So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? Okay .
[27:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:16] Speaker_C | No . 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out"
"[27:23] Speaker_C | and that would be fine , yeah ."
[27:32] Speaker_A | Seems fine .
"[27:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think that's brilliant ."
"[27:37] Speaker_B | Right , so we've done that ."
[27:42] Speaker_B | Okay . Product evaluation .
"[27:46] Speaker_B | We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . Um"
[27:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:57] Speaker_B | I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
[28:00] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[28:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:05] Speaker_B | um in the sense that
[28:09] Speaker_B | um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like uh autonomy ?
"[28:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'd say , as a team ."
"[28:16] Speaker_D | Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary ."
[28:17] Speaker_A | I think we had a nice time .
[28:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:21] Speaker_C | Find out from each other , yeah ."
[28:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:33] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah ."
"[28:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well ."
[28:51] Speaker_B | Thank you . How did you find it ?
"[28:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but yeah ."
[29:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:26] Speaker_B | Yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um"
[29:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:46] Speaker_C | Mm .
[29:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:50] Speaker_B | teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .
"[29:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , well ."
[30:06] Speaker_D | Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s .
[30:09] Speaker_B | Maybe .
[30:12] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[30:14] Speaker_B | No , that was quite fun . Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ?"
[30:19] Speaker_D | How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
[30:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:26] Speaker_D | Could it've been better , was it adequate ?"
"[30:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually"
[30:36] Speaker_D | Mm .
[30:37] Speaker_C | had had more time and if we'd been separated more .
"[30:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , yeah . But it was nice having it there ."
[30:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:50] Speaker_B | Um like the whole picture of the thing .
"[30:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , moving around the room . But I think it's good , like uh we spent times individually ."
[30:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:34] Speaker_A | I never thought of a remote control with a flip top .
"[31:40] Speaker_D | It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area ."
[31:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:46] Speaker_B | Mm .
[31:49] Speaker_C | Vegetables .
[31:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , no . Well they have to come from somewhere , don't they ?"
"[31:58] Speaker_D | Absolutely , yeah ."
"[32:00] Speaker_B | And as sh as w sorry , you go . Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it ."
"[32:01] Speaker_A | Yep , sorry , go on Sarah ."
[32:10] Speaker_C | No .
[32:10] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:33] Speaker_B | Mm .
[32:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah ."
"[32:41] Speaker_B | But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . But people could have anything that they wanted ."
[32:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:49] Speaker_C | No .
[32:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:15] Speaker_C | Mm .
[33:17] Speaker_B | Because of the produ
[33:21] Speaker_B | Mm .
[33:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:30] Speaker_D | I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based ."
[33:35] Speaker_A | Right .
[33:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:51] Speaker_B | Yes .
[33:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[33:59] Speaker_B | Well , it's innovation for money's sake . The the people have to keep buying . Yeah ."
[33:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[34:07] Speaker_B | And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . Yes ."
[34:11] Speaker_D | Mm . Mm .
"[34:14] Speaker_D | Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah ."
"[34:24] Speaker_B | There we go . Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um"
"[34:41] Speaker_B | like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?"
[34:45] Speaker_C | Well .
[34:49] Speaker_D | I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
[34:51] Speaker_C | I think that was just the the physical .
[34:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:57] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:05] Speaker_A | Maybe fifty percent more .
"[35:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think yeah I don't from the market research ."
"[35:08] Speaker_D | But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do , and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for ."
[35:12] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[35:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:20] Speaker_C | No .
[35:23] Speaker_D | I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want .
[35:26] Speaker_B | Mm .
[35:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:33] Speaker_B | It's a shame it won't ever get made . Maybe it will . Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it .
[35:36] Speaker_A | Who knows ?
[35:38] Speaker_C | I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is .
"[35:42] Speaker_B | Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , so good luck ."
[35:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[35:51] Speaker_A | There's a final questionnaire .
"[36:07] Speaker_A | Celebration , you didn't talk about that ."
[36:09] Speaker_B | I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds .
[36:12] Speaker_B | Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks .
[36:16] Speaker_D | Questionnaire .
[36:16] Speaker_B | Oh .
[36:22] Speaker_C | Okay . Is that it then ?
"[36:24] Speaker_B | Um yeah , just the last , I think ."
[36:31] Speaker_C | Awesome .
[36:36] Speaker_B | last thingy .
[36:37] Speaker_D | Questionnaire done .
"[36:40] Speaker_D | Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time ."
[36:44] Speaker_C | Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your
[36:49] Speaker_C | thing ?
"[36:50] Speaker_D | Oh , right . But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? Yeah ."
"[36:51] Speaker_C | I don't think . Yeah , the the s yeah . I think yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting ."
[36:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
[37:01] Speaker_B | I just got con

"[00:01] Speaker_B | Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group"
"[00:13] Speaker_C | Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ?"
"[00:18] Speaker_B | Um , yeah , go for it mate ."
"[00:20] Speaker_C | Um , N_E_Z_"
[00:21] Speaker_B | N_ E_ Z_ . Ebenezer . And your role is ?
[00:23] Speaker_C | E_R_ .
[00:26] Speaker_C | I'm the Marketing Expert .
"[00:28] Speaker_B | You're the Marketing Expert , okay ."
[00:32] Speaker_B | Next we have ?
[00:34] Speaker_D | Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ .
[00:36] Speaker_B | T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ?
[00:39] Speaker_D | Industrial Designer .
[00:40] Speaker_B | Industrial Designer .
"[00:47] Speaker_B | And , lastly we have ?"
"[00:49] Speaker_A | Uh , Dave Cochrane ."
"[00:52] Speaker_B | And you're going to be the User Interface , is it ? Designer . Okay ."
"[00:54] Speaker_A | User Interface Defin Designer , yes ."
"[01:02] Speaker_B | Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart ."
"[01:58] Speaker_B | First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right ."
[02:23] Speaker_C | Sure .
[02:27] Speaker_C | Whiteboard . 'Kay .
"[02:34] Speaker_C | S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time ."
"[03:32] Speaker_C | 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world ."
"[03:38] Speaker_C | First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant ."
"[03:54] Speaker_C | So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer ."
"[04:03] Speaker_B | Brilliantly done . Thank you . Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?"
[04:04] Speaker_C | Thank you .
[04:15] Speaker_C | Oh . Oh oh I think you ga
"[04:16] Speaker_B | Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt ."
"[04:16] Speaker_D | Do we take them off ? Oh right , okay ."
[04:18] Speaker_B | You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well .
[04:23] Speaker_D | Ah-ha .
"[04:44] Speaker_B | Yep , the , it's just across there , that's it ."
[04:50] Speaker_B | Yep .
[04:59] Speaker_D | Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?
[05:01] Speaker_C | I think so .
[05:03] Speaker_C | Yeah . There you go .
"[05:08] Speaker_B | You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range ."
"[05:17] Speaker_D | Uh , destroying your elephant here ."
[07:12] Speaker_B | have a dash .
"[09:21] Speaker_A | Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most ."
[10:05] Speaker_B | Cheers .
"[10:56] Speaker_B | Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal ."
"[11:20] Speaker_B | Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them ."
"[11:45] Speaker_C | Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , okay ."
"[11:49] Speaker_B | Yep . Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold ."
[11:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:01] Speaker_B | Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls .
[12:10] Speaker_B | Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
"[12:16] Speaker_A | Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket ."
[13:09] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[13:32] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion ."
"[13:39] Speaker_A | Absolutely prohibitive , yeah ."
[13:40] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[13:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros ."
"[14:13] Speaker_A | For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um"
"[14:39] Speaker_C | Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . So perhaps one that was more um"
[14:54] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[15:03] Speaker_B | Okay .
[15:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[15:27] Speaker_B | Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , yeah ."
[15:28] Speaker_D | Mm .
[15:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[15:33] Speaker_C | Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot ."
"[15:44] Speaker_C | Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that ."
[15:52] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:22] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[16:26] Speaker_B | And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out
[16:31] Speaker_C | What the user wants uh .
"[16:32] Speaker_B | what the user wants , yes . Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?"
[16:33] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[16:42] Speaker_D | Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of"
"[16:47] Speaker_D | stick on it , rather than buttons ?"
"[16:48] Speaker_C | Oh . Okay , ."
[16:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[16:56] Speaker_B | I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um"
[17:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:12] Speaker_B | and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well ."
"[17:25] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of"
[17:47] Speaker_A | slightly unconventional or attractive uh
"[17:52] Speaker_A | sha shape for it overall , ."
[17:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[17:55] Speaker_B | So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different ."
"[17:56] Speaker_A | A curve , mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway ."
[18:08] Speaker_B | Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily .
"[18:13] Speaker_B | I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right ."
"[18:20] Speaker_B | I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody ."
[18:29] Speaker_C | 'Kay . So .
[18:30] Speaker_B | Yeah ? Okay .
"[18:38] Speaker_B | Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us ."

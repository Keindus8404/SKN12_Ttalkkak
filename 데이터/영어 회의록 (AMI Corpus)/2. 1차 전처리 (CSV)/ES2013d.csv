"[00:16] Speaker_A | Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open ."
[00:31] Speaker_A | Ah-ha .
[00:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:38] Speaker_A | We'll open that when the time is right .
"[00:45] Speaker_A | Closing things down , okay ."
[00:59] Speaker_A | Let's see what this thing does .
"[01:02] Speaker_A | Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good ."
[01:24] Speaker_A | Okay .
[01:26] Speaker_A | Are we ready to start ?
[01:30] Speaker_A | Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five .
[01:43] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[01:51] Speaker_A | Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay ."
[02:47] Speaker_A | Where is it ?
[02:51] Speaker_D | Red .
[02:53] Speaker_A | I need to open mine .
[02:59] Speaker_A | Not the agenda .
[03:02] Speaker_D | Agenda three .
"[03:03] Speaker_A | No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations ."
[03:06] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[04:28] Speaker_A | um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us ."
"[05:06] Speaker_A | Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation ."
[05:32] Speaker_C | Yes .
[05:33] Speaker_B | Yep .
[05:44] Speaker_B | Ta-da . Right .
[05:45] Speaker_C | Alright .
[05:45] Speaker_A | Over to you .
[05:47] Speaker_C | Well .
"[05:50] Speaker_A | Ooh , two ."
"[05:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . This is the one"
[05:55] Speaker_A | Ah .
[05:58] Speaker_C | that I made .
[05:59] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[06:00] Speaker_C | It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is"
"[06:10] Speaker_C | like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus ."
[06:35] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[06:39] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:51] Speaker_C | Uh position , I presume that just means"
"[06:55] Speaker_C | right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? Form"
"[07:09] Speaker_C | curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold ."
"[07:17] Speaker_C | Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic ."
[07:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:33] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[07:58] Speaker_C | So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth ."
"[08:09] Speaker_C | Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons ."
"[08:20] Speaker_C | So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we"
"[08:29] Speaker_C | well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it ."
[08:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[08:39] Speaker_C | Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well ."
"[09:05] Speaker_B | Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that ."
"[10:05] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really ."
"[10:05] Speaker_C | I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded ,"
[10:14] Speaker_B | A banana .
"[10:23] Speaker_C | it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and"
"[10:52] Speaker_A | Oh I see , the on-off's in the back ."
"[10:54] Speaker_B | Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it ."
[10:59] Speaker_C | If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .
"[11:01] Speaker_B | And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place ."
[11:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:10] Speaker_A | I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the"
"[11:15] Speaker_C | Breaking , oh right . Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid ."
[11:15] Speaker_A | you know yeah .
[11:27] Speaker_D | I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
[11:31] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[11:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? It's texting ."
[11:40] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
[11:51] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[11:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:58] Speaker_B | And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make ."
"[12:02] Speaker_D | It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable ."
[12:08] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[12:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:24] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:29] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:34] Speaker_A | Okay . The next item is evaluation .
"[12:40] Speaker_D | No , okay ."
[12:42] Speaker_A | Uh if that's if you're finished .
[12:43] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[12:44] Speaker_D | shall I take your uh power ?
[12:47] Speaker_A | Oh sorry .
[13:04] Speaker_D | Oh .
[13:08] Speaker_A | Try again .
"[13:26] Speaker_D | Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers"
"[13:48] Speaker_D | a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board ."
[14:40] Speaker_D | Okay . So um
"[14:47] Speaker_D | fancy ,"
"[14:50] Speaker_D | technologically innovative ,"
"[14:54] Speaker_D | easy to use , trendy ,"
"[14:59] Speaker_D | buttons ,"
"[15:01] Speaker_D | excess buttons , good buttons ,"
"[15:08] Speaker_D | ugly ,"
"[15:13] Speaker_D | sellable ,"
"[15:16] Speaker_D | and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap ."
"[15:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials ."
"[15:28] Speaker_D | Mm , yeah , price ."
[15:29] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[15:31] Speaker_D | We'll put price up at the top .
"[15:37] Speaker_A | Well we will soon , unfortunately ."
[15:44] Speaker_A | Come on .
"[15:48] Speaker_D | Did you say ? Uh okay , so"
"[15:49] Speaker_A | No , ."
[15:54] Speaker_D | wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
"[15:58] Speaker_C | It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like"
[16:07] Speaker_C | baroque curliness and which
"[16:11] Speaker_C | I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,"
"[16:13] Speaker_B | Yes , a plain , simple , clean design ."
"[16:16] Speaker_C | simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy ."
[16:22] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[16:28] Speaker_C | I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic ."
[16:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:32] Speaker_A | Elegant .
[16:34] Speaker_A | Elegant .
[16:35] Speaker_D | Elegant .
"[16:36] Speaker_B | Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant ."
[16:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[16:42] Speaker_B | Stylish , yeah ."
[16:51] Speaker_C | Fancy .
[16:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . N that um
[16:57] Speaker_C | Did you just break the pen ?
[16:58] Speaker_D | yeah uh the uh is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .
[17:03] Speaker_C | Well d we'll just call it fancy then .
"[17:05] Speaker_D | Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy ."
"[17:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape"
[17:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:27] Speaker_A | Mm .
[17:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:36] Speaker_C | or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so ."
[17:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:47] Speaker_D | As a banana .
[17:50] Speaker_D | I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .
[17:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:56] Speaker_D | And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk ."
[17:59] Speaker_A | The chunk .
"[18:03] Speaker_C | So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two ."
"[18:05] Speaker_D | No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them ."
[18:11] Speaker_D | Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ?
"[18:12] Speaker_A | I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true ."
"[18:17] Speaker_A | It's more true than false , about a two ."
[18:18] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:19] Speaker_D | So we say true . Um
[18:27] Speaker_B | I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .
[18:29] Speaker_D | Yeah . So we'll say we'll say uh false .
[18:35] Speaker_D | Easy to use .
[18:36] Speaker_B | Very .
[18:36] Speaker_C | Yes .
[18:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:46] Speaker_A | Trendy .
[18:46] Speaker_C | Oh yes .
"[18:46] Speaker_D | trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity ."
[18:50] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:57] Speaker_B | We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . I think yeah .
[19:03] Speaker_D | Okay .
[19:03] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[19:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:09] Speaker_A | Excess buttons . No .
[19:10] Speaker_D | are there excess buttons ?
[19:11] Speaker_B | No .
[19:11] Speaker_C | No .
"[19:23] Speaker_A | Better , more intuitive buttons , yes ."
[19:25] Speaker_D | True .
[19:27] Speaker_D | Ugly .
[19:28] Speaker_B | No .
[19:29] Speaker_A | No .
"[19:30] Speaker_D | People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . Yeah , I do too ."
"[19:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?"
[19:38] Speaker_C | Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
[19:39] Speaker_A | I like it .
"[19:41] Speaker_C | It could be quite a good brand , like"
[19:44] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[19:44] Speaker_C | a good little object .
[19:46] Speaker_D | And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ?
"[19:55] Speaker_C | Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy ."
"[19:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , with the energy ."
[19:58] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[20:00] Speaker_D | It is going to be kinetic ?
[20:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:02] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[20:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro ."
[20:07] Speaker_D | Uh so yes .
"[20:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we haven't"
"[20:10] Speaker_C | completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah ."
"[20:13] Speaker_D | Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?"
[20:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:23] Speaker_B | Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .
[20:26] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[20:27] Speaker_A | Yes , the instinct says true ."
[20:29] Speaker_D | So true one or should I go to two or three ?
[20:33] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[20:34] Speaker_C | I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus"
"[20:41] Speaker_C | and things . I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . uh we need somebody to develop that ."
"[20:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true ."
"[20:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get ."
[20:46] Speaker_B | True .
[20:56] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[20:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's a good point ."
[21:03] Speaker_D | other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ?
"[21:09] Speaker_D | And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . And then um excess buttons ."
[21:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:22] Speaker_C | Just putting no excess buttons .
[21:24] Speaker_D | Exactly .
[21:27] Speaker_D | Wow we're doing really well .
"[21:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity ."
"[21:32] Speaker_C | As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition"
[21:40] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:48] Speaker_D | Or L_C_D_ .
[21:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:54] Speaker_D | Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .
[22:13] Speaker_A | I think we're good .
[22:18] Speaker_D | Mm .
[22:25] Speaker_A | Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .
[22:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[22:40] Speaker_D | Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here ."
[22:44] Speaker_A | Yep .
[22:48] Speaker_A | Right .
[22:55] Speaker_D | Thank you for everyone's help with that .
[23:00] Speaker_A | Right .
"[23:03] Speaker_A | And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um"
[23:24] Speaker_A | it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
"[23:32] Speaker_A | Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells ."
[23:38] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[23:38] Speaker_C | Well , just kinetic then , ."
[23:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:46] Speaker_A | what's a hand dynamo ?
[23:48] Speaker_C | It's the wind-up .
"[23:49] Speaker_A | Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one ."
[23:58] Speaker_B | Just one .
"[24:02] Speaker_A | Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those ."
[24:12] Speaker_B | Just checking that .
"[24:30] Speaker_B | Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest ."
"[24:35] Speaker_A | Okay , and we only need one of those . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's that's uh uh one ."
[24:37] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[24:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? Um do we have"
"[24:51] Speaker_C | What does double curved mean , I don't understand ."
[24:52] Speaker_A | And that's
[24:53] Speaker_B | I I think you it means you reverse the curve .
[24:54] Speaker_A | uh that's the the one that goes like this .
"[24:56] Speaker_C | Oh no , we don't need that . No ."
"[24:56] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah ."
[24:58] Speaker_A | Right .
"[24:59] Speaker_C | Single-curved , I'd say ."
"[25:00] Speaker_A | No , single curve ."
"[25:06] Speaker_A | Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . We had the special colour ."
[25:12] Speaker_C | I just wanna say plastic .
[25:16] Speaker_A | And did we say plastic ?
"[25:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess ."
"[25:22] Speaker_D | One , two , three , four , five , six ."
[25:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:28] Speaker_A | Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , isn't it ?"
[25:38] Speaker_C | It's just button .
[25:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:41] Speaker_B | Yes .
[25:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:42] Speaker_B | Yep . Do we need to say how many buttons , or"
[25:47] Speaker_B | or d is it just one ?
"[25:52] Speaker_A | No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black ."
[25:56] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[26:05] Speaker_A | Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?"
"[26:07] Speaker_B | Uh they'll be rubber , yep ."
[26:09] Speaker_A | So we need one of them .
[26:13] Speaker_A | And are they any special form ?
"[26:16] Speaker_C | Well yeah , like the compass point one ."
"[26:21] Speaker_B | Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic ."
[26:38] Speaker_A | 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .
"[26:40] Speaker_B | Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case ."
[26:45] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[26:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , they could be plastic ."
"[26:56] Speaker_A | let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement ."
"[27:02] Speaker_B | It's just one , isn't it ?"
[27:04] Speaker_A | Uh we only need one of them .
[27:08] Speaker_A | Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
"[27:17] Speaker_B | What , we're in ."
[27:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:19] Speaker_A | We're in . That's us .
[27:24] Speaker_B | More profit .
[27:25] Speaker_C | Great .
"[27:34] Speaker_A | desktop , project documents . Okay ."
[27:40] Speaker_A | As our project document bit .
[27:42] Speaker_B | Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?
[27:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:49] Speaker_A | There we are .
"[27:53] Speaker_A | That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity ."
[28:03] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[28:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , leadership ,"
[28:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:19] Speaker_D | Sure .
"[28:20] Speaker_A | teamwork ,"
[28:21] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[28:22] Speaker_A | means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things ."
[28:26] Speaker_C | And Play-Doh .

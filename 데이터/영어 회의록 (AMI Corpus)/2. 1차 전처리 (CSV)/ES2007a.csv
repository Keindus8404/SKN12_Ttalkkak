[09:13] Speaker_D | Ah .
[09:14] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[09:16] Speaker_A | Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working ."
"[09:31] Speaker_A | Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros ."
[09:51] Speaker_D | Market range internationally sold .
"[09:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make ."
[09:58] Speaker_D | Ah right okay .
[10:18] Speaker_A | Stuff like that .
[10:21] Speaker_A | Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
"[10:32] Speaker_C | So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our"
[10:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Mm .
[10:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:09] Speaker_C | roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .
"[11:13] Speaker_A | Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?"
[11:18] Speaker_A | Pretty much everybody .
[11:22] Speaker_A | Um .
[11:23] Speaker_B | Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?
[11:25] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .
[11:28] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:31] Speaker_A | 'Kay um .
[11:33] Speaker_D | A new remote control for T_V_ .
[11:36] Speaker_D | What would I like ? Um .
[11:42] Speaker_A | You want it big do you want it small .
[11:46] Speaker_D | Medium .
[11:53] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[11:55] Speaker_C | Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something ."
[12:16] Speaker_A | Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .
[12:16] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:21] Speaker_A | 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,"
[12:33] Speaker_D | Mm .
[12:34] Speaker_A | but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
[12:44] Speaker_D | Twelve fifty .
[12:45] Speaker_C | It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .
[12:46] Speaker_D | Each .
"[12:47] Speaker_A | Per unit , yeah ."
[12:49] Speaker_C | Cost .
[12:53] Speaker_B | Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .
"[12:53] Speaker_A | Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things ."
[13:07] Speaker_B | Right .
[13:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:15] Speaker_A | Um .
[13:15] Speaker_D | Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?
[13:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:36] Speaker_A | Okay , that's ."
"[13:37] Speaker_D | into one . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically ."
[13:45] Speaker_A | Th that's an idea .
[13:47] Speaker_D | So you just flip them out .
[13:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:49] Speaker_B | Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated ."
[13:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:14] Speaker_A | One side for kids , one side for adults ."
"[14:16] Speaker_B | Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button ."
"[14:19] Speaker_C | I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it ."
[14:29] Speaker_C | Oh .
[14:30] Speaker_C | Oh okay .
[14:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:35] Speaker_C | Okay .
[14:36] Speaker_D | That would be cool . I was thinking that like a flip .
"[14:37] Speaker_A | F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe ."
[14:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[14:46] Speaker_A | Um , oh we've got five minutes left ."
[14:50] Speaker_B | Start breaking up .
[14:53] Speaker_D | Okay . Um .
[14:53] Speaker_A | But okay .
[14:56] Speaker_A | Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .
"[14:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate"
[15:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:26] Speaker_C | D_V_D_ players , things like that ."
"[15:30] Speaker_A | I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one ."
[15:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:47] Speaker_C | Okay .
[15:51] Speaker_C | Right .
[15:53] Speaker_A | What do you reckon ?
"[15:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , I mean ."
"[15:56] Speaker_A | See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make ."
"[16:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um"
[16:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:28] Speaker_C | Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,"
[16:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:34] Speaker_A | Or just one that looks really fucking cool .
[16:38] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[16:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , no I think you're right ."
[16:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:10] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[17:12] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen ."
"[17:35] Speaker_D | does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something ."
"[17:40] Speaker_A | Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah ."
[17:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:45] Speaker_D | But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . So make it Yeah .
"[17:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah ."
[17:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable ."
[17:55] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[17:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:59] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[18:00] Speaker_D | And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto"
[18:13] Speaker_B | Okay .
[18:19] Speaker_C | I guess that's good good for now .
[18:20] Speaker_A | Let's move on .
[18:22] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[18:22] Speaker_A | Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay ."
[18:27] Speaker_D | W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?
[18:33] Speaker_D | Ah ri okay . these are requirement specification .
[18:36] Speaker_A | Um .
[18:37] Speaker_D | And I'm marketing .
[18:37] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[18:44] Speaker_A | User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um ."
[18:46] Speaker_C | That's me . Okay .
[18:53] Speaker_C | Right . Right .
"[18:58] Speaker_A | Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um"
"[19:08] Speaker_A | whether it's what goes into the box , somehow ."
[19:13] Speaker_B | Mm . Har how it works an
[19:20] Speaker_A | User requirements specifications .
[19:22] Speaker_D | So what the user requires
[19:24] Speaker_D | in a remote .
"[19:26] Speaker_A | Right , okay , yeah ."
"[19:27] Speaker_C | Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap ."
[19:28] Speaker_D | I guess that's what it says .
"[19:28] Speaker_A | You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together ."
[19:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:36] Speaker_A | You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that ."
[19:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[19:55] Speaker_A | Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting ."
"[19:57] Speaker_C | Alright , see you in thirty minutes ."

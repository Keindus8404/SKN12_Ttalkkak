[01:14] Speaker_A | So we can start ?
[01:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:20] Speaker_C | Ah okay .
[01:23] Speaker_C | It's Ada Longmund ?
[01:34] Speaker_A | So um we will have to
"[01:41] Speaker_A | um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly ."
[02:07] Speaker_A | Record .
[02:11] Speaker_A | So the project method is the following .
"[02:15] Speaker_A | So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design ."
[02:38] Speaker_A | Uh .
[02:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[02:48] Speaker_C | Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , yeah ?"
[02:52] Speaker_A | Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
[02:55] Speaker_A | and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
[02:56] Speaker_D | So right now ?
"[03:01] Speaker_A | I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later ."
"[03:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know ."
"[03:08] Speaker_A | So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's quite good price , yeah . And uh"
[03:12] Speaker_B | Twenty five Euros ?
[03:13] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[03:16] Speaker_C | I it's it's reasonable , s quite yeah . Twenty five ."
"[03:18] Speaker_D | It's reasonable , I think , yeah ."
[03:24] Speaker_A | it will uh be a
"[03:27] Speaker_A | an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy ."
"[04:06] Speaker_A | And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,"
[04:14] Speaker_A | so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
"[04:39] Speaker_D | Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI and okay ."
[04:42] Speaker_B | Yep .

[06:00] Speaker_B | Use it .
[06:02] Speaker_B | Make make yeah .
"[06:05] Speaker_C | And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like ."
"[06:09] Speaker_B | Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . I design the user f user interface , you design the function ."
[06:10] Speaker_C | Yeah . So the materi
"[06:18] Speaker_A | Maybe , it is the outside and the inside ."
[06:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[06:25] Speaker_B | Okay .

[06:52] Speaker_A | And yeah .
[06:58] Speaker_C | Ok Okay .
"[06:59] Speaker_A | And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . And not too expensive ."

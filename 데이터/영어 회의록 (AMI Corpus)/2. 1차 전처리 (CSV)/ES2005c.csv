[00:32] Speaker_C | Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . Um I have
[00:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[00:45] Speaker_C | mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that
[00:51] Speaker_D | Okay . Cool .
[01:00] Speaker_C | are particularly bothering you ?
"[01:03] Speaker_D | Mm um . No , I don't think so ."
"[01:06] Speaker_C | No ? Okay , cool . Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj ."
[01:07] Speaker_A | No .
[01:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[01:32] Speaker_B | First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit ."
"[01:55] Speaker_B | So what are our findings ? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls ."
"[02:49] Speaker_D | The last one is the most important one , is it ? Oh , sorry ."
"[02:51] Speaker_B | No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . So that indicates our technological advancement ."
[02:57] Speaker_D | Okay .
[02:59] Speaker_D | Okay .
[03:32] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[03:32] Speaker_B | And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls ."
[03:40] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[04:18] Speaker_B | Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming Yeah . So Yeah . So something like that we we should do ."
[04:33] Speaker_D | Okay . Yeah .
"[04:35] Speaker_A | We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . It's Yeah ."
[04:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . Th that's very good .
[04:43] Speaker_D | Glow-in-the-dark .
[04:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[04:54] Speaker_D | Well , that's good . That's what we kind of predicted anyway ."
[05:02] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:04] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:06] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[05:08] Speaker_D | Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?"
[05:19] Speaker_D | Okay . Quite disposable . Okay .
[05:24] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
"[05:25] Speaker_C | Alright , okay ."
[05:30] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[05:33] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:35] Speaker_C | Fashion .
[05:39] Speaker_D | Cool .
[05:45] Speaker_D | Mm . A remote control ? Yeah .
"[05:54] Speaker_D | And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ?"
[06:06] Speaker_C | Mm-mm-mm-mm .
[06:09] Speaker_D | Cool .
[06:14] Speaker_C | Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm .
"[06:16] Speaker_D | F_ , what is it ? Um ."
[06:19] Speaker_C | Function F_ eight .
[06:25] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[06:26] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[06:32] Speaker_B | Oh no , ."
[06:33] Speaker_D | No signal .
[06:38] Speaker_D | Is that ?
"[06:39] Speaker_A | No , it's got it's got it ."
"[06:44] Speaker_D | Okay , and then F_ five , right ?"
"[06:48] Speaker_C | Uh , yeah ."
[06:49] Speaker_D | Okay . Um
"[06:52] Speaker_D | okay , so the interface concept um ."
"[06:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . The interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . Yeah ."
[07:24] Speaker_C | Mm 'kay .
[07:29] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[07:42] Speaker_C | Uh okay .
"[08:03] Speaker_C | Right , okay . Yeah ."
[08:11] Speaker_C | Excellent .
[08:14] Speaker_C | Uh no just escape
"[08:15] Speaker_D | Escape , okay ."
[08:27] Speaker_A | Wow .
[08:33] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[08:35] Speaker_C | Looks pretty complicated .
"[08:44] Speaker_C | Right , okay ."
"[08:50] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , like the middle button ."
[08:53] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[08:58] Speaker_C | Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . Right , okay ."
"[09:10] Speaker_D | Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen ."
"[09:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , presumably ."
"[09:21] Speaker_D | I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one ."
[09:29] Speaker_A | Uh it looks threatening .
"[09:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous ."
[09:34] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[09:47] Speaker_C | Okay .
[09:54] Speaker_A | Wow .
"[09:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever ."
"[10:07] Speaker_D | Right , yeah ."
"[10:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . I don't think that will sell very well ."
"[10:34] Speaker_C | No they do , they do . They listen to it . Yeah ."
"[10:54] Speaker_C | Right , okay ."
"[11:08] Speaker_C | 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ?"
"[11:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes ."
"[11:17] Speaker_D | So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah ."
[11:32] Speaker_C | Brilliant .
[11:42] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[12:11] Speaker_A | The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh , I think ."
[12:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:14] Speaker_D | And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ?"
"[12:17] Speaker_B | But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . Uh yeah . Yeah . So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market ."
[12:22] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[12:26] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[12:26] Speaker_D | Uh-huh . But our budget , we've Yeah ."
"[12:27] Speaker_C | It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know ."
[12:40] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[12:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
[12:47] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[12:47] Speaker_D | I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , ."
[12:48] Speaker_A | Ben bana
[12:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:57] Speaker_D | The L_C_D_ .
[13:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:06] Speaker_C | But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them ."
[13:11] Speaker_D | No .
[13:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . S
[13:17] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[13:21] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
"[13:21] Speaker_A | But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ?"
[13:21] Speaker_C | Twelve fifty .
"[13:28] Speaker_B | Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa"
"[13:35] Speaker_A | But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th"
[13:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:41] Speaker_D | That's true , yeah ."
"[13:45] Speaker_D | And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um"
[13:49] Speaker_C | Right .
"[14:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , I know , carrot ."
[14:23] Speaker_A | The the lemon . Well what are the options ?
[14:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[14:26] Speaker_D | But we don't want it to be Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . I think that's a good idea to go for ."
[14:33] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well .
"[14:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um ."
[14:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:45] Speaker_C | I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people"
[14:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:51] Speaker_C | will have come in contact with that kind of use .
"[14:52] Speaker_D | S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . Um so there you go ."
[14:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:06] Speaker_A | Oh .
[15:06] Speaker_D | So that's um the user interface
[15:10] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[15:11] Speaker_D | design .
"[15:14] Speaker_D | So okay , I'll take this out now then ."
[15:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:25] Speaker_A | Um so
[15:26] Speaker_D | There you go .
"[15:28] Speaker_A | I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among ,"
"[15:33] Speaker_C | Yeah , looks like it ."
"[15:34] Speaker_A | and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those ."
[15:37] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[15:48] Speaker_A | And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it ."
"[15:53] Speaker_A | Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget ."
"[16:13] Speaker_A | So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me ."
"[16:22] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose ."
"[16:25] Speaker_A | Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch"
[16:28] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[16:38] Speaker_C | So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?"
"[16:41] Speaker_A | Right , it's very they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . Oh here it is ."
[17:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[17:08] Speaker_C | Right .
[17:20] Speaker_C | Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?
"[17:25] Speaker_A | R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make ."
[17:35] Speaker_A | Right . So this is what we need to have for certain .
"[17:38] Speaker_A | Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team"
"[18:04] Speaker_A | uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,"
"[18:12] Speaker_A | um latex , double-curved , curved ."
"[18:15] Speaker_A | So lots of choices , what do we think ?"
[18:16] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[18:19] Speaker_C | Well .
[18:20] Speaker_D | Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge .
"[18:25] Speaker_A | Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure ."
[18:27] Speaker_C | Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and
[18:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:31] Speaker_A | Um .
[18:32] Speaker_C | and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?
"[18:43] Speaker_A | Okay so , here are a a plastic ,"
"[18:52] Speaker_C | Oh right , okay ."
[18:54] Speaker_A | Oh right .
[18:57] Speaker_A | So something with give to it . Okay . And
[18:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:00] Speaker_D | And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .
"[19:02] Speaker_A | and the colour is yellow , right ?"
"[19:04] Speaker_D | Yeah , y yellow incorporated , yeah ."
"[19:06] Speaker_A | Yellow , okay . Um ."
[19:18] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[19:20] Speaker_D | Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , I don"
[19:28] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:30] Speaker_A | Mm' kay .
"[19:32] Speaker_A | So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ?"
[19:33] Speaker_C | Um .
[19:37] Speaker_C | Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself .
[19:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:41] Speaker_A | So multi-coloured buttons .
"[19:42] Speaker_D | You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah ."
"[19:48] Speaker_C | Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps ."
"[19:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish ."
"[19:57] Speaker_C | Yeah . Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,"
[20:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[20:09] Speaker_C | a bit comfier , you know ."
[20:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:15] Speaker_A | Um how exactly ? Maybe
"[20:23] Speaker_C | Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it ."
[20:28] Speaker_D | It's not Yeah .
[20:29] Speaker_A | What about a banana ?
[20:32] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[20:34] Speaker_A | Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , right ?"
[20:40] Speaker_D | Yeah . But then how would you point it ?
[20:44] Speaker_B | Ah yeah . Mm-hmm .
"[20:46] Speaker_A | Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end ."
[20:51] Speaker_C | They only cost pennies .
[21:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:07] Speaker_C | Huh ?
[21:12] Speaker_A | So a spongy banana re Yeah .
[21:13] Speaker_D | Rubber banana . Okay .
"[21:22] Speaker_A | Okay , okay ."
[21:35] Speaker_C | And sponginess .
"[21:36] Speaker_D | And spongy , yeah ."
[21:36] Speaker_A | So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a
[21:37] Speaker_B | Spongy .
[21:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:44] Speaker_D | Maybe , yeah ."
[21:45] Speaker_A | maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric .
[21:46] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[21:47] Speaker_D | Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that ."
[21:55] Speaker_A | So it'd look like this kinda .
"[21:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's what I was thinking ."
"[21:58] Speaker_A | Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?"
[21:59] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[21:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , maybe that's what they are ."
"[22:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end ."
[22:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:11] Speaker_C | Yeah , why the hell not . Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros ."
[22:13] Speaker_D | I don't know . What do you guy What do you think ?
"[22:16] Speaker_C | Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , yeah ?"
[22:23] Speaker_D | No .
[22:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Yeah . Exactly ."
"[22:32] Speaker_A | Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?"
[22:43] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[22:44] Speaker_C | There's a good man . There's a good idea .
[22:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[22:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[22:46] Speaker_A | Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy ."
"[22:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that ."
"[22:52] Speaker_A | Okay , we could do that . Um ."
[22:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[22:55] Speaker_D | And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ?"
"[23:01] Speaker_C | Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um"
[23:07] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[23:09] Speaker_A | Okay , so"
[23:13] Speaker_A | so buttons .
[23:14] Speaker_C | things that are always used .
"[23:16] Speaker_A | Okay , just like that ."
[23:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:23] Speaker_A | Okay . With the scroll-wheel or no ?
"[23:29] Speaker_C | Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably ."
[23:38] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[23:39] Speaker_A | Okay there's the microphone .
[23:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:41] Speaker_A | Where should I put the microphone ?
[23:42] Speaker_C | I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?
"[23:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . Um yeah , I can no I'm not sure ."
"[23:52] Speaker_C | Glad , we're not doing this for real ."
"[23:57] Speaker_A | Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?"
[23:57] Speaker_D | I couldn
[23:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
[24:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:10] Speaker_C | I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah ."
[24:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:15] Speaker_A | 'Kay there's the mic .
"[24:16] Speaker_C | So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition ."
[24:16] Speaker_D | That's cool .
[24:29] Speaker_C | Oops . Um .
[24:34] Speaker_A | Um .
[24:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . Um .
"[24:49] Speaker_A | Oops , sorry . Okay ."
"[24:52] Speaker_D | And uh so what else was there ? Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? Are we just gonna leave that ?"
[25:01] Speaker_D | You still like it .
[25:03] Speaker_D | 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system .
[25:08] Speaker_A | Right .
"[25:09] Speaker_C | Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . Um don't wanna sort of overkill ."
[25:13] Speaker_D | 'Cause um it could Yeah .
[25:17] Speaker_D | Especially with yellow . Mm . I dunno .
[25:20] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[25:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:47] Speaker_C | Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah ."
[25:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:52] Speaker_C | I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple ."
"[25:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , do we need buttons ?"
[26:00] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[26:05] Speaker_D | I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base ."
"[26:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good ."
[26:15] Speaker_C | Groovy .
[26:16] Speaker_D | and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know .
"[26:21] Speaker_A | But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . It can sit at a distance and pick it up still ."
[26:26] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[26:30] Speaker_B | Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah . In that w"
"[26:31] Speaker_C | Yeah , gives you the options ."
[26:41] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:53] Speaker_C | So a selection of casings .
"[26:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ?"
[26:58] Speaker_B | S s sorry ?
"[27:00] Speaker_D | You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice ."
"[27:03] Speaker_B | Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without uh yeah ."
[27:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[27:15] Speaker_C | Like like mobiles , yeah ."
[27:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:30] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[27:34] Speaker_D | Okay . We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ?"
"[27:39] Speaker_C | You can standardise those , I mean ."
"[27:41] Speaker_D | Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay ."
"[27:47] Speaker_D | Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay ."
"[27:57] Speaker_D | Okay , okay ."
[28:05] Speaker_D | Okay .
[28:06] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
[28:19] Speaker_D | Mm mm .
"[28:22] Speaker_C | You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down ."
[28:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[28:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:04] Speaker_D | Well , um because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . I mean we could make it nice pale yellow ."
"[29:13] Speaker_C | Okay , so we stick with what we've got there ."
[29:35] Speaker_C | Mm 'kay .
"[29:43] Speaker_C | Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different"
[29:45] Speaker_D | Okay .
[29:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:48] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[29:53] Speaker_D | Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan ."
"[29:59] Speaker_C | kinda going round , yeah ."
[30:02] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[30:02] Speaker_C | Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing ."
[30:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:18] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[30:21] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[30:21] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[30:36] Speaker_C | Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . Uh yeah ."
"[30:41] Speaker_A | Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power ."
"[30:44] Speaker_D | Oh , a d a dynamo ?"
"[30:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , ."
[30:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Yeah that's quite cool ."
[30:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:54] Speaker_C | Okay .
[30:56] Speaker_C | You shake it and scream at it . Yeah .
"[30:58] Speaker_B | But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah ."
"[30:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , it is , yeah ."
[31:15] Speaker_A | Right .
"[31:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah ."
"[31:19] Speaker_C | Okay , okay . Right um what are the other options ?"
[31:20] Speaker_D | That's true .
[31:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[31:23] Speaker_A | Uh there's solar power . Um .
"[31:25] Speaker_B | Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah . Yeah . What we w yeah . I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . They can they can recharge it ."
[31:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:33] Speaker_C | I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window ."
[31:39] Speaker_D | But w like just normal light ?
[31:42] Speaker_C | Oh that's true .
"[31:45] Speaker_C | I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a ,"
[31:53] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[31:53] Speaker_D | And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ?"
"[31:55] Speaker_C | yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition ."
[31:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:07] Speaker_A | 'Kay .

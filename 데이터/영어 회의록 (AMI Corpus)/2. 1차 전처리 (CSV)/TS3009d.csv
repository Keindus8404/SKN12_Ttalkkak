[00:33] Speaker_A | Uh fourth meeting .
[00:38] Speaker_B | We have to do what ?
[00:39] Speaker_A | Some extra deciding .
[00:42] Speaker_B | Oh .
[00:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[00:54] Speaker_A | Then um I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it , so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that . So the you're uh . I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design ."
[00:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[01:12] Speaker_A | And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production"
[01:24] Speaker_A | and then uh we can close .
[01:27] Speaker_C | Alright .
[01:39] Speaker_B | I think it is .
[01:46] Speaker_A | Alright .
[02:18] Speaker_C | Repeat it yeah . Alright .
[02:20] Speaker_A | This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . And then uh we can we can uh use the time better .
[02:25] Speaker_D | Okay .
[02:30] Speaker_A | Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .
[02:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[02:40] Speaker_B | No you go and I'll uh
[02:42] Speaker_B | supplement you .
[02:46] Speaker_C | Right . Uh well this is our design . Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front .
"[03:01] Speaker_C | We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front ."
[03:23] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[03:35] Speaker_C | of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium ."
"[03:42] Speaker_C | You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look ."
"[04:01] Speaker_C | Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . Yeah ?"
[04:01] Speaker_A | Mm .
[04:15] Speaker_B | It's a double R_ .
"[04:17] Speaker_C | It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner ."
[04:18] Speaker_B | But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah .
"[04:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , alright ."
[04:22] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:28] Speaker_C | Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .
[04:35] Speaker_B | Oval yeah .
[04:38] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[04:41] Speaker_C | So uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m"
[04:45] Speaker_C | The m
[04:46] Speaker_B | Channel up and volume ?
"[04:48] Speaker_C | Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh"
[05:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:21] Speaker_A | Alright .
[05:22] Speaker_B | Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .
"[05:22] Speaker_C | And the video button . The Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen ."
[05:24] Speaker_D | Mm right .
[05:29] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[05:30] Speaker_C | Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .
[05:35] Speaker_C | Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions . Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? Yeah the back . Yeah .
[05:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:38] Speaker_A | Oh yeah alright . Yeah .
[05:58] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:03] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:18] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:29] Speaker_C | Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device ."
[06:31] Speaker_A | Well . Yeah I see it .
[06:35] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[06:38] Speaker_B | Well , it won't be visible ."
[06:41] Speaker_B | Mm ?
[06:46] Speaker_C | Why ?
[06:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[06:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
"[06:54] Speaker_A | Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the"
"[07:04] Speaker_A | fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands ."
"[07:09] Speaker_B | If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . You you have it a bit uh Yeah ."
"[07:14] Speaker_D | It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it ."
[07:21] Speaker_A | And how large is it ?
[07:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's the question ."
"[07:24] Speaker_C | That's the question . Uh well Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . But now you have a totally different ."
"[07:34] Speaker_A | Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh ?"
"[07:36] Speaker_B | Well , they lay there all the time ."
"[07:37] Speaker_C | The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean Side ? Uh oh the side ? W we we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea ."
[07:43] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
"[07:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it ."
[08:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:04] Speaker_C | But you you hold it like this . You're not holding it like this or something .
"[08:09] Speaker_C | You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . Well y y y you don't have it like this . You have it more like this . You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way ."
[08:15] Speaker_A | No no no .
[08:19] Speaker_D | Like you're holding your telephone .
[08:20] Speaker_A | Yep .
[08:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:22] Speaker_D | Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen ."
[08:25] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[08:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree on this ."
[08:47] Speaker_A | Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .
[08:58] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
"[08:58] Speaker_C | Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . But do you"
[09:10] Speaker_C | But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .
"[09:13] Speaker_A | No not totally . For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that ."
[09:24] Speaker_D | And you might be uh You might be target customer .
"[09:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Well uh who who else thinks like you ? We don't know . Maybe a thousand people , or a million people ."
[09:27] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[09:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . So let it be like this at uh at this moment . Okay ?"
"[09:40] Speaker_A | No , I think it's great ."
[09:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:42] Speaker_B | But what about the redesigning ?
[09:56] Speaker_A | That's more useful
[09:58] Speaker_A | than just speaking .
"[10:07] Speaker_D | Well , this is just a short intro . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends ."
[10:09] Speaker_A | Yes .
[10:25] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[10:26] Speaker_D | And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them ."
[10:38] Speaker_D | Uh uh uh uh mm .
[10:44] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[10:45] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[10:46] Speaker_D | I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?"
[11:09] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[11:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this ."
[11:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:12] Speaker_D | No , I know , but I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire ."
[11:12] Speaker_B | Well we designed it to be good-looking .
[11:20] Speaker_A | To the customers ? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?
"[11:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , but I can't can s"
[11:25] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[11:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:37] Speaker_D | We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . So But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we we know where we stand . 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .
"[11:49] Speaker_A | Well , one ."
[11:55] Speaker_A | Well so it's point four .
[11:57] Speaker_A | Easy to find t
[11:59] Speaker_D | Right . Uh is it good-looking ?
"[12:02] Speaker_C | Well , I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um"
[12:22] Speaker_D | The titanium might be uh f
[12:25] Speaker_D | for older people .
[12:28] Speaker_D | It you put uh put a black front on it or something .
[12:30] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[12:31] Speaker_C | Uh no . I think Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people ."
[12:48] Speaker_D | Right .
"[12:51] Speaker_B | I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah ."
[12:55] Speaker_D | Right .
"[12:56] Speaker_A | No . I totally agree . We we have to get get on , go through this ."
"[12:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , the fourteen yeah ."
"[12:58] Speaker_D | Right , a number please ."
[13:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:02] Speaker_C | Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .
[13:05] Speaker_D | So the last one is seven . Easy to change channels ?
"[13:08] Speaker_A | No , not false ."
[13:10] Speaker_A | It's one .
"[13:11] Speaker_D | Oh , sorry . Yeah , right ."
[13:15] Speaker_A | Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it .
[13:16] Speaker_D | Change channels ?
[13:22] Speaker_D | Right .
"[13:27] Speaker_D | The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?"
"[13:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , huge is a Yeah ."
[13:29] Speaker_A | Yep .
[13:32] Speaker_A | Two .
[13:32] Speaker_D | Two ?

"[14:27] Speaker_D | Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ?"
[14:27] Speaker_A | We you have to put it to the customers .
"[14:31] Speaker_A | Uh well well a bit , so four ."
[14:35] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[14:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , very much . One ."
[14:37] Speaker_A | One . And features included also one .
[14:41] Speaker_A | And One . Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .
[14:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:49] Speaker_A | Device fancy feeling . Yeah , cool man ."
"[14:49] Speaker_C | And I think fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back . Yeah ."
[14:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:52] Speaker_D | Right .
[14:53] Speaker_A | Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .
[14:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:58] Speaker_A | Is the device easy to use ? Yes we have not many buttons .
[15:02] Speaker_C | So well maybe two because of the voice recorder .
"[15:03] Speaker_D | Well , with the uh Three ."
[15:03] Speaker_B | Two two .
"[15:03] Speaker_A | Two , three ."
"[15:06] Speaker_A | Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? Well in our covers , in our fronts . So yes , one . Is the material attractive ?"
[15:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . One or two . Yeah .
"[15:12] Speaker_B | One or two , another two ."
[15:15] Speaker_C | Four ?
[15:19] Speaker_D | No .
[15:21] Speaker_A | Oh okay . Okay .
[15:22] Speaker_B | Well three .
"[15:23] Speaker_D | Three , alright ."
"[15:27] Speaker_A | Is the material attractive ? Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two ."
[15:28] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[15:35] Speaker_D | Right .
[15:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:41] Speaker_B | This is the last meeting ? Yeah .
"[15:42] Speaker_A | Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me ."
[15:43] Speaker_D | The average will uh come later .
[15:52] Speaker_C | I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .
[15:55] Speaker_A | Oh .
[15:57] Speaker_C | There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .
"[15:59] Speaker_A | Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point ."
[16:05] Speaker_C | My god .
[16:06] Speaker_A | I had to fit it in .
"[16:07] Speaker_D | It has to go to twelve , right ? Twelve and a half ."
[16:09] Speaker_A | I twelve and a half .
[16:13] Speaker_A | Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .
"[16:18] Speaker_A | The sample speaker , the s sensor ."
[16:19] Speaker_D | Out . That's easy . Kick it out . Yeah .
"[16:21] Speaker_A | Kick it out . We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker costs far , by far the most ."
[16:22] Speaker_B | The what ?
[16:24] Speaker_D | The speaker .
[16:25] Speaker_B | Oh .
[16:28] Speaker_C | Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .
[16:30] Speaker_A | It it isn't worth it .
"[16:33] Speaker_C | No . No , d th No ."
[16:33] Speaker_D | No .
[16:37] Speaker_D | It's just extra . Kick it out .
"[16:39] Speaker_A | So , zero ."
[16:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:43] Speaker_A | Then we go to fourteen point six .
[16:46] Speaker_D | What more ?
[16:46] Speaker_A | Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .
[16:49] Speaker_C | No .
"[16:50] Speaker_A | L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery ."
[16:58] Speaker_B | Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
[17:02] Speaker_A | Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .
[17:05] Speaker_B | Yeah ? Can't we do that with a regular chip ?
[17:05] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[17:07] Speaker_C | No .
[17:08] Speaker_B | Why not ?
[17:09] Speaker_C | Because uh that uh y because my information says it .
[17:12] Speaker_A | Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?
[17:15] Speaker_C | Huh ?
[17:16] Speaker_A | What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
[17:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . Regular is normal .
[17:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:20] Speaker_A | And simple ?
[17:21] Speaker_B | Simple .
[17:26] Speaker_A | Well ?
[17:28] Speaker_A | Your part .
[17:36] Speaker_C | Well you have to use
"[17:41] Speaker_C | Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen ."
[17:42] Speaker_A | How much do we win ? One .
"[17:48] Speaker_C | But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen ."
[17:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:51] Speaker_B | Uh well we have to put that in .
"[17:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen ."
"[17:54] Speaker_A | Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour ."
"[18:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , but No , that's n It's not relevant ."
[18:03] Speaker_B | Nah .
"[18:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , then you s then you only have one half left ."
"[18:05] Speaker_B | Yeah , you must change the chip uh back ."
"[18:08] Speaker_B | You must change the chip back , Nils ."
[18:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:10] Speaker_A | Uh yeah .
[18:11] Speaker_C | But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .
"[18:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . You have to use it ."
"[18:30] Speaker_B | You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double . Y we don't need both ."
[18:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:35] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[18:36] Speaker_A | No , the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display ."
[18:39] Speaker_C | For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .
[18:41] Speaker_B | Says .
"[18:42] Speaker_A | Says , his Uh that was in the second meeting , I think ."
"[18:48] Speaker_A | Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . We can also make it flat ."
[18:52] Speaker_B | I ? ?
[18:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:58] Speaker_C | But what what did what do n Sorry , but What do they mean with the curves ? Is th Is this a curve ? One curve ? Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . It's how you It's how you look at it ."
"[19:02] Speaker_A | Curved ? Yes , that's curved ."
[19:05] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[19:06] Speaker_A | No , it's one curve ."
"[19:08] Speaker_A | One curve , simple ."
[19:10] Speaker_C | Well then we have a huge problem I think . W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .
[19:13] Speaker_A | We have a big financial problem .
[19:15] Speaker_B | Well we make it more expensive to buy .
[19:34] Speaker_D | Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing
[19:43] Speaker_D | people might buy .
"[19:49] Speaker_A | By the way , we also have this one ."
"[19:53] Speaker_D | Oh , that's just great ."
"[20:10] Speaker_A | Yes , but I just got it ."
[20:12] Speaker_B | Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh
"[20:17] Speaker_B | plastic coloured titanium , uh titanium-coloured plastic ?"
[20:21] Speaker_A | Who ?
[20:26] Speaker_A | You want to dump the titanium ?
[20:29] Speaker_B | Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .
"[20:32] Speaker_A | And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there ."
[20:39] Speaker_B | But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .
"[20:40] Speaker_A | Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy ."
[20:47] Speaker_B | Ah no no .
[20:49] Speaker_B | It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .
"[20:51] Speaker_A | No , I don't think so ."
"[20:52] Speaker_B | Well , I do think so ."
"[20:59] Speaker_C | And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . Yeah ."
"[21:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
[21:13] Speaker_B | Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .
"[21:15] Speaker_C | Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then ."
[21:19] Speaker_B | We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .
[21:25] Speaker_D | I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .
"[21:29] Speaker_B | No , nothing ."
[21:30] Speaker_D | Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . Because you have lots of functions in it too .
[21:31] Speaker_B | Amen .
[21:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:53] Speaker_C | Unfortunately . Um .
[21:56] Speaker_A | I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .
[21:57] Speaker_C | Titanium-coloured plastic .
"[22:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
[22:05] Speaker_C | So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .
[22:09] Speaker_B | No no no no . W Titanium stays there .
"[22:19] Speaker_C | So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid ."
"[22:33] Speaker_A | Yes , yes ."
[22:34] Speaker_B | No because we did not know anything about it .
"[22:36] Speaker_D | If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive ."
[22:36] Speaker_A | One and a half Euros . Hmm ?
[22:45] Speaker_A | So ?
[22:46] Speaker_D | So we have to make it cheaper .
[22:47] Speaker_C | Titanium gone and add plastic .
[22:50] Speaker_D | Right .
"[22:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , but then we've got money left ."
[22:52] Speaker_C | And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?
"[22:55] Speaker_A | Well , no it's just uh all plastic . Well alright . Huh ."

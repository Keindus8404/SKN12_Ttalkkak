[00:00] Speaker_A | So is Why not save that .
"[00:03] Speaker_D | No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere ."
[00:27] Speaker_D | And then find it .
[01:11] Speaker_A | Right .
[01:16] Speaker_C | Well we've made our prototype anyway .
[01:20] Speaker_D | You pass it round to have a look .
"[01:26] Speaker_C | Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on ."
[01:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[01:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac ."
"[01:58] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? What's that one there ?"
"[02:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . Ah , that's the mute ."
"[02:04] Speaker_D | Oh , okay . Right ."
[02:09] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[02:11] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[02:11] Speaker_B | For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons ."
[02:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[02:19] Speaker_C | Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller ."
[02:25] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[02:27] Speaker_B | Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue ."
[02:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[02:39] Speaker_A | R right . Um , all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button ."
"[02:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus ."
"[02:58] Speaker_A | So However , I've now . But um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose ."
[03:05] Speaker_D | I'll see if I can find them .
"[03:15] Speaker_B | Yeah , sis"
"[03:34] Speaker_B | Yes , we'll have the slide-away ."
"[03:36] Speaker_A | Right , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting ."
[03:38] Speaker_B | Bottom .
[03:44] Speaker_A | Right .
"[03:47] Speaker_A | So So , we've got"
[04:09] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[04:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[04:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[04:30] Speaker_B | Yes , yes ."
[04:39] Speaker_D | Right .
[04:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:57] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[05:08] Speaker_B | This this is a yes , this is our presentation of the prototype ."
[05:09] Speaker_D | That's the pr
"[05:12] Speaker_A | Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros ."
[05:12] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:27] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[05:32] Speaker_A | So , there's no redesign . So that should uh Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is"
[05:58] Speaker_B | Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
[06:04] Speaker_A | Right .
[06:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:07] Speaker_B | 'Kay , Alice ."
"[06:09] Speaker_B | So , sh"
"[06:10] Speaker_D | We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype ."
[06:14] Speaker_A | Right . .
[06:17] Speaker_B | 'Kay this should be then .
"[06:20] Speaker_A | Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved"
[06:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:51] Speaker_B | Have a push button interface .
"[07:19] Speaker_D | Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is ."
[07:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:40] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:43] Speaker_A | And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .
"[08:13] Speaker_A | Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic ."
"[08:24] Speaker_D | I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button ."
"[08:31] Speaker_A | Mm . I would Every design change is uh I dunno , um Okay , um ,"
[08:33] Speaker_D | I don't know though .
[08:41] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[08:49] Speaker_A | if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form ."
[09:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:01] Speaker_A | And when
[09:04] Speaker_A | I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half .
"[09:10] Speaker_A | As far as I know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . And if What happened ?"
[09:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:26] Speaker_D | You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row .
[09:37] Speaker_C | Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . Yeah .
"[09:43] Speaker_A | Now , right . Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh"
"[09:51] Speaker_A | if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there ."
[09:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[10:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:06] Speaker_A | So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven I've got . Okay ."
[10:08] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[10:09] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:16] Speaker_A | that would work out fine if uh
[10:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[10:19] Speaker_A | uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on ."
[10:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:41] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[10:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:55] Speaker_A | Well , hold on . Um , if we"
"[11:01] Speaker_A | Okay , that gives us twelve point seven"
"[11:20] Speaker_C | Um , . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ?"
"[11:30] Speaker_B | Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic ."
[11:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:37] Speaker_A | And go for battery instead . That would give you one less .
[11:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:38] Speaker_B | We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov"
[11:41] Speaker_A | But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
"[11:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them ."
[11:58] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:12] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:24] Speaker_C | I think the voice recognition .
[12:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:43] Speaker_D | Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on ."
[12:52] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Makes sense .
[12:53] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[13:10] Speaker_A | Sorry , do you want that back up ?"
"[13:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , I just had a presentation to"
[13:14] Speaker_A | Right .
[13:18] Speaker_C | But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .
"[13:26] Speaker_A | Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost ."
"[13:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm . Right okay um ,"
"[13:38] Speaker_D | This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess ."
"[14:15] Speaker_D | So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so ,"
[14:25] Speaker_D | We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .
[14:31] Speaker_D | The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use .
[14:49] Speaker_B | Okay .
[15:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:25] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[15:27] Speaker_B | Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time ."
[15:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
"[15:33] Speaker_B | Um , sorry that'd be considered fancy ."
"[15:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'd maybe give it a"
[15:39] Speaker_C | a two .
[15:44] Speaker_C | One's true .
[15:47] Speaker_C | And a four is neutral .
[15:51] Speaker_B | So maybe maybe a two .
"[15:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can ."
[15:56] Speaker_D | Right .
[16:02] Speaker_D | Okay . Right . I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space .
[16:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:16] Speaker_D | So uh say about a two for fancy , you think ? Okay ."
[16:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , why not not , m m maybe nearer three ."
"[16:24] Speaker_A | Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options ."
[16:35] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[16:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[16:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit ."
"[16:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ?"
[16:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:51] Speaker_D | 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?"
"[16:57] Speaker_B | Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition ."
[17:07] Speaker_D | D yeah .
"[17:10] Speaker_D | Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we ."
[17:17] Speaker_B | But not the kinetic .
[17:19] Speaker_D | But not the kinetic .
[17:20] Speaker_B | Like the power .
[17:20] Speaker_A | No . 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too .
"[17:23] Speaker_B | No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both ."
[17:37] Speaker_C | Maybe a three .
[17:40] Speaker_D | Okay . Yeah .
"[17:41] Speaker_A | Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options ."
[17:42] Speaker_C | I would give it more than a four .
[17:47] Speaker_B | Right .
[17:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[18:00] Speaker_D | Right , okay ."
"[18:00] Speaker_A | And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera ,"
[18:00] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[18:18] Speaker_A | if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else ."
[18:38] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:38] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[18:39] Speaker_A | And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category ."
[18:57] Speaker_D | I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um
[19:02] Speaker_D | the product .
[19:04] Speaker_C | How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?
[19:11] Speaker_C | Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better .
"[19:17] Speaker_A | Um , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . That that that would make the significant difference . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . And that would enable you to to do it ."
[19:47] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[19:48] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:51] Speaker_D | Okay .
[19:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:18] Speaker_C | Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it ."
"[20:20] Speaker_A | It's rubber as it is , yes ."
"[20:21] Speaker_D | So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the"
[20:28] Speaker_D | both the um
[20:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[20:47] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:50] Speaker_A | I would've said about a two as well .
[20:52] Speaker_D | Do you reckon a two ?
"[20:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two ."
[20:56] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[21:02] Speaker_A | The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time ."
[21:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:12] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , I would say so as well ."
"[21:16] Speaker_A | Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some ."
"[21:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess ."
"[21:24] Speaker_B | It does , yeah ."
[21:27] Speaker_A | Yep .
[21:28] Speaker_D | Say about a three maybe ?
[21:30] Speaker_A | I don't know .
[21:31] Speaker_C | Maybe two ?
[21:34] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[21:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable ."
[21:37] Speaker_D | It's a two .
[21:45] Speaker_A | r uh reaction product ?
"[21:49] Speaker_B | Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying"
[21:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:56] Speaker_B | where it comes from .
[21:59] Speaker_A | Oh .
[22:05] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:21] Speaker_D | What do y
"[22:21] Speaker_C | Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine ."
"[22:25] Speaker_B | Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . Um , it depends which way you look at it ."
[22:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:33] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[22:35] Speaker_A | Okay . So we're going for a
[22:38] Speaker_B | Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d
"[22:39] Speaker_A | two , three ?"
[22:41] Speaker_D | Two or three ?
"[22:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , two or three . Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . But um ,"
[22:49] Speaker_A | Sure .
[22:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:52] Speaker_C | I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it .
"[23:00] Speaker_A | Right , okay ."
[23:06] Speaker_D | Two . Okay .
[23:10] Speaker_D | Right .
[23:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:18] Speaker_C | What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ?
[23:27] Speaker_A | About a two .
[23:29] Speaker_A | Two .
"[23:35] Speaker_D | So yeah , pretty close to a two ."
"[23:38] Speaker_D | So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad ."
[23:42] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[23:44] Speaker_A | Two b two b two , yeah ."
[23:51] Speaker_A | Yes .
[23:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:54] Speaker_A | Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements ."
[23:59] Speaker_D | Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the
"[24:02] Speaker_A | Okay , well I put it back on ."
[24:04] Speaker_B | So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
[24:09] Speaker_D | I'm not sure .
"[24:13] Speaker_A | Yes , I would've thought so ."
"[24:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going ."
[24:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:18] Speaker_A | Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ?"
[24:23] Speaker_C | Ah it's on .
"[24:24] Speaker_A | Oh . Oh . How kind . Right , okay . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got"
"[24:41] Speaker_A | the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item ."
[24:50] Speaker_A | That's right .
[24:55] Speaker_D | Mm .
[24:56] Speaker_B | In right within the budget range .
[24:58] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[24:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway ."
"[25:02] Speaker_B | So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements ."
[25:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:07] Speaker_D | Different different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case ."
[25:07] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[25:17] Speaker_B | Possibly , yeah ."
[25:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:27] Speaker_A | So we're going for plastic , yes ?"
[25:30] Speaker_A | Yep .
[25:38] Speaker_B | Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ?
"[25:43] Speaker_A | Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour ."
"[25:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons ."
[25:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:59] Speaker_A | Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium ."
"[26:17] Speaker_B | I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Yeah , which I think we should Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price ."
[26:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:24] Speaker_A | Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there ."
[26:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[26:29] Speaker_D | Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe ."
"[26:39] Speaker_B | Okay , uh that's probably it ."
"[26:40] Speaker_D | Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that . 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it ."
[26:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[26:49] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So special colours , two ."
[26:54] Speaker_D | Right .
"[26:54] Speaker_A | And we've got special form is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ?"
"[27:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit ."
[27:10] Speaker_B | Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form .
[27:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:18] Speaker_B | Well you got you got twelve .
"[27:26] Speaker_D | Okay , so tha"
"[27:28] Speaker_B | So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , so we're still"
[27:29] Speaker_A | Right .
"[27:34] Speaker_A | Yep , that makes sense ."
[27:42] Speaker_A | Yep .
[27:46] Speaker_A | I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .
[27:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:04] Speaker_C | Real Reactions ?
"[28:05] Speaker_B | R yeah . Yeah , yeah . I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative"
[28:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:21] Speaker_A | Yep I would s
[28:55] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:55] Speaker_A | Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . And that"
[29:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:17] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[29:19] Speaker_D | So , we've what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of"
[29:23] Speaker_D | the plastic .
[29:25] Speaker_D | Is it The rubber .
"[29:26] Speaker_B | That yeah , that was uh that was just about all . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest ."
[29:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[29:36] Speaker_B | So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . And that is like the most standard type of button ."
"[29:48] Speaker_D | So I mean , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but"
"[29:52] Speaker_D | we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them ."
[30:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[30:11] Speaker_A | Well , ease has certainly stayed ."
"[30:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to"
[30:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?
[30:18] Speaker_B | to use .
[30:23] Speaker_A | And the speech feature .
"[30:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , the speech feature ."
"[30:35] Speaker_A | How it would play out , yeah . Oh ."
[30:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of
[30:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more ."
[31:02] Speaker_D | We cou
"[31:02] Speaker_C | Um , apart from maybe"
"[31:05] Speaker_C | doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing ."
[31:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[31:10] Speaker_C | But then what colour would you make the R_s ?
[31:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:18] Speaker_A | Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on ."
[31:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
[31:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[31:34] Speaker_B | I'm still not quite sure we've established that .
"[31:37] Speaker_C | No , I just We got the logo off the web browser ."
"[31:37] Speaker_A | Don't think so . But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it ."
[31:40] Speaker_D | Oh right .
[31:53] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[31:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:21] Speaker_D | Okay .
[32:23] Speaker_D | Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
"[32:28] Speaker_A | You could put in another Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard ."
[32:29] Speaker_D | Another colour . Or would that be t
[32:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:38] Speaker_D | Okay .
[32:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[32:55] Speaker_A | m may or may not be the case .
"[33:00] Speaker_A | Well , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?"
"[33:16] Speaker_C | Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well ."
"[33:24] Speaker_B | Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start ."
[33:28] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[33:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important ."
[33:53] Speaker_A | Alright . Okay .
[33:53] Speaker_D | 'Cause you Yeah .
[33:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:56] Speaker_A | So we just add that to profitability in effect .
[34:00] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[34:09] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[34:22] Speaker_C | Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel ."
"[34:31] Speaker_D | Well , but I think we said that w"
"[34:34] Speaker_D | Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . le lemon sh"
"[34:41] Speaker_C | Alright . Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ?"
[34:55] Speaker_B | Definitely lemon shaped .
"[35:05] Speaker_D | Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ?"
[35:10] Speaker_B | You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . So I think we can we're okay .
"[35:12] Speaker_D | Right , okay ."
[35:12] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . So we're okay this way around .
[35:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:18] Speaker_D | So that so we've saved
"[35:23] Speaker_B | Then we say it's fine , so it's all good ."
[35:27] Speaker_D | Saved two Euros on that .
[35:52] Speaker_A | So what bit are we on to ?
"[36:05] Speaker_A | Yeah . I th I th Oh . Right , okay ."
[36:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[36:20] Speaker_A | Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I ."
[36:49] Speaker_C | So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
"[36:53] Speaker_D | Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them ."
[36:57] Speaker_C | Right .
[37:00] Speaker_D | I guess we just have to adjust things to
[37:07] Speaker_B | And we seem to have least something in each criteria .
[37:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[37:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think"
[37:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:20] Speaker_B | everything .
[37:20] Speaker_D | Yep .
[37:31] Speaker_C | So do we have anything else to discuss ?
[37:48] Speaker_A | What's happened here ?
[38:16] Speaker_A | Mm .
[38:31] Speaker_B | We've got the closing .
[38:31] Speaker_A | So we've done the
[38:34] Speaker_A | the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process .
"[38:40] Speaker_A | Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it ."
[38:56] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[39:14] Speaker_C | Huh .
[39:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[39:19] Speaker_A | I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do ."
[39:26] Speaker_D | Okay .
[39:49] Speaker_A | Creativity .
"[39:55] Speaker_B | Um , yeah . Yeah ."
[39:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[39:57] Speaker_D | I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
[40:04] Speaker_A | Individual meetings . How do you mean ?
"[40:06] Speaker_D | Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in"
[40:10] Speaker_A | In you on your own .
[40:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[40:51] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[40:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[40:54] Speaker_B | Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant ."
[40:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:30] Speaker_C | I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um
"[41:39] Speaker_D | Yeah , the thing itself ."
[41:40] Speaker_C | kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
[41:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:43] Speaker_C | I can't think of a better example at the minute .
[41:44] Speaker_A | Have could have used a different
[41:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:57] Speaker_B | Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then
[42:01] Speaker_A | Creativity .
[42:02] Speaker_B | something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
[42:04] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[42:30] Speaker_A | I th I uh d
"[42:35] Speaker_A | But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever ."
[42:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[43:03] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[43:53] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[43:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[43:58] Speaker_B | Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . I think there's one one more to go ."
[43:58] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[44:01] Speaker_A | Alright , so we've got uh"
[44:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[44:12] Speaker_A | New ideas found , did we find any , no ."
"[44:14] Speaker_B | It was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier ."
"[44:18] Speaker_A | Alright . Leadership , teamwork ."
[44:19] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[44:32] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
"[44:33] Speaker_A | You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls ."
[44:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[44:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[44:37] Speaker_C | Well it's a different application of it .
"[44:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Okay ,"
"[44:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way ."
[44:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
[44:45] Speaker_A | so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
"[44:48] Speaker_D | That went okay , yeah ."
"[44:51] Speaker_B | Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them ."
"[44:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , yeah ."
[44:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[44:58] Speaker_A | To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay .
"[45:14] Speaker_D | Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know ,"
[45:20] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[45:21] Speaker_D | high definition D_V_D_ and
"[45:25] Speaker_D | portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ"
"[45:44] Speaker_C | Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it ."
[45:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[46:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[46:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[46:05] Speaker_A | Now , I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However , um Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment . Oh ."
"[46:36] Speaker_C | But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug the computer or something ?"
[46:46] Speaker_D | I think there's a little there's a little um chi
[46:56] Speaker_C | Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of .
"[46:59] Speaker_D | I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page ."
"[47:03] Speaker_A | Right . New ideas found , so one or two ."
[47:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[47:08] Speaker_D | Kinetic powered remote control . Um ,"
[47:13] Speaker_D | what was the other one ?
[47:14] Speaker_C | Voice um recognition thing .
[47:15] Speaker_D | Vo yeah .
[47:25] Speaker_A | and uh
"[47:34] Speaker_D | Voice recognition , yeah . S"
[47:35] Speaker_A | recognition .
[47:43] Speaker_D | Almost . To fill in these fill in these questionnaires
[47:51] Speaker_D | Oh no .
[48:04] Speaker_D | Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
[48:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[48:20] Speaker_A | I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind you , the the figure last was was different , but it should be poss"

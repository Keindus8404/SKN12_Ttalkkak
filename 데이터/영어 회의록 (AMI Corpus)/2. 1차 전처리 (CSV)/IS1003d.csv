"[00:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . So , ready ?"
[00:39] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[00:43] Speaker_D | Crap .
[00:45] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[00:57] Speaker_D | 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?"
[01:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:08] Speaker_A | let's go for our detailed design meeting .
[01:12] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[01:12] Speaker_A | So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba ."
[01:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:33] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[02:06] Speaker_C | I have slides .
[02:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[02:10] Speaker_C | Ah , that is three ."
[02:11] Speaker_B | Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
[02:14] Speaker_C | Product prod
[02:14] Speaker_D | What slides ?
[02:16] Speaker_C | Yep .
[02:17] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[02:22] Speaker_C | So , this is our product or prototype ."
[02:28] Speaker_C | This is made by clay .
"[02:31] Speaker_C | Yeah . Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo"
[02:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[02:57] Speaker_B | Okay .
[03:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[03:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's true ."
"[03:31] Speaker_C | the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it ."
"[03:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , s okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so"
"[04:06] Speaker_C | uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel"
[04:27] Speaker_A | Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
[04:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[04:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush"
"[04:31] Speaker_B | Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d"
"[04:32] Speaker_C | Mushroom design , yeah ."
[04:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:38] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[04:42] Speaker_B | To integrate , you know yeah ."
"[04:44] Speaker_B | I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in"
[04:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:50] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[04:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah ."
[04:54] Speaker_A | Fruits and vegetables .
[04:57] Speaker_A | Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .
[04:59] Speaker_D | I don't think it is .
[05:01] Speaker_A | It's vegetable .
[05:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:02] Speaker_B | Mushroom ? Oh , uh I'm not sure . We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour ."
[05:02] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[05:04] Speaker_A | So th it's something eatable .
[05:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:09] Speaker_D | But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine ."
"[05:12] Speaker_B | I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know ."
"[05:22] Speaker_B | And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so ."
[05:27] Speaker_D | True .
[05:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:32] Speaker_A | Next slide .
[05:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:48] Speaker_B | You know , we don't need to k . You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i"
[05:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:56] Speaker_C | Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
[06:00] Speaker_A | In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ?
[06:01] Speaker_C | Base . Here ?
[06:04] Speaker_D | But we say uh we sa we said solar .
[06:07] Speaker_A | Where is the solar cell ?
[06:13] Speaker_A | Oh . Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ?
[06:14] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[06:19] Speaker_A | Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?"
[06:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[06:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[06:30] Speaker_D | I mean , we gonna try to measure how"
"[06:35] Speaker_D | good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , and first one was uh"
[06:50] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:54] Speaker_D | look and feel .
[06:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:57] Speaker_D | So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check ."
"[07:09] Speaker_B | So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable ."
"[07:12] Speaker_D | One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Ouch ."
[07:16] Speaker_B | Oops .
[07:21] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[07:22] Speaker_D | Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?"
"[07:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think so ."
[07:25] Speaker_B | I think you have nice colours . I don't The sha the bowl shape people like .
"[07:38] Speaker_D | Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look ."
"[07:56] Speaker_D | I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious ."
[08:02] Speaker_A | It would be bet more like a lemon ?
[08:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:08] Speaker_B | Because i
[08:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:12] Speaker_B | Less button .
"[08:16] Speaker_C | so , my mush ."
[08:18] Speaker_A | Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
[08:20] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[08:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , but you don't have any button now ."
[08:23] Speaker_D | Yeah . I dunno .
"[08:24] Speaker_A | And you know , you have the"
"[08:27] Speaker_A | finger here , with the buttons ?"
[08:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:30] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[08:32] Speaker_A | It looks more like a pineapple . Sorry . What's the use for that ?
"[08:37] Speaker_C | Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel ."
[08:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:48] Speaker_C | Uh .
[08:52] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:54] Speaker_D | Wait th that's the second point . First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
[08:58] Speaker_B | If it is fancy or not .
[09:02] Speaker_B | So we can we can say t
"[09:05] Speaker_B | The colour , is the colour acceptable ?"
[09:08] Speaker_B | So the shape now .
[09:09] Speaker_A | It looks like a now you took it .
[09:12] Speaker_B | It's too much red ? In the basement ?
[09:13] Speaker_D | Um if
[09:27] Speaker_A | Seven is the ma the maximum ?
[09:29] Speaker_B | I'll gi
"[09:29] Speaker_D | No , seven is false and one is true ."
"[09:33] Speaker_B | I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me ."
"[09:35] Speaker_A | Three , I will say three ."
[09:37] Speaker_D | Three ?
[09:38] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:39] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[09:42] Speaker_D | Three .
[09:42] Speaker_A | Isn't it bitter like that ?
[09:48] Speaker_D | The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
[09:53] Speaker_A | Feasible ?
[10:00] Speaker_B | Embedded .
"[10:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . There four microphone . So they they they they there's a microphone array ."
"[10:03] Speaker_B | It's a micro array , okay ."
"[10:04] Speaker_A | Oh . Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?"
"[10:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c"
"[10:13] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , yeah ."
"[10:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah ."
"[10:19] Speaker_D | Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single ."
[10:25] Speaker_A | We have tactile buttons .
[10:29] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[10:29] Speaker_B | I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have That's good . And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . Yeah ."
"[10:31] Speaker_D | No , that's good . Yeah ."
"[10:35] Speaker_A | Oh , yeah ."
"[10:36] Speaker_D | Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe okay ."
[10:42] Speaker_A | Maybe two ?
"[10:43] Speaker_D | So using the same scale , two ?"
[10:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:45] Speaker_A | Two ? I would say two . You agree ?
"[10:45] Speaker_B | Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so ."
[10:48] Speaker_D | Okay . Now maybe the most critical one .
"[10:48] Speaker_C | Yeah , I agree ."
"[10:49] Speaker_A | It's better like that , isn't it ?"
[10:52] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:56] Speaker_D | is it easy to use ?
"[11:01] Speaker_B | Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You just need the command ."
"[11:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's very easy ."
[11:06] Speaker_C | You can use this in this way .
[11:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:13] Speaker_C | Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel .
[11:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:18] Speaker_D | Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
[11:20] Speaker_C | You just tu turn d d
[11:22] Speaker_B | I think maybe if you he
[11:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:32] Speaker_D | Yeah but imagine you y
"[11:37] Speaker_D | Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?"
"[11:44] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult ."
[11:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:54] Speaker_D | Yeah . I agree . I agree . But I mean if you're fro from two ?
"[11:57] Speaker_C | I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah ."
[12:01] Speaker_B | I think something that Yeah .
"[12:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on ."
[12:07] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
[12:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:20] Speaker_C | No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the"
"[12:27] Speaker_C | the turn ,"
[12:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
"[12:41] Speaker_D | So you you count one degree , two degrees , no ."
"[12:45] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it ."
"[12:48] Speaker_C | I think so I think so you can do it . I think so , you can just change ."
"[13:01] Speaker_C | There's uh also a number , you know ."
"[13:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?"
"[13:14] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah ."
"[13:18] Speaker_D | And this would be more for browsing , ah ."
[13:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:24] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
[13:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:28] Speaker_A | Seems to be good .
[13:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:35] Speaker_D | Yeah , I mean you're famous . You ."
"[13:36] Speaker_C | And also you can , if you i"
"[13:38] Speaker_C | You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine ."
"[13:41] Speaker_B | It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe ."
[13:53] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[13:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah yeah . That's"
[13:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:58] Speaker_C | So it's coarse to fine design .
"[13:59] Speaker_B | that's very technologic , so . Yeah ."
[14:00] Speaker_D | Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .
[14:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
"[14:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , th you have the vocal commands ."
"[14:12] Speaker_B | Uh it's k on off , yeah ."
[14:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:13] Speaker_A | On off .
"[14:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas"
[14:18] Speaker_A | Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
"[14:22] Speaker_D | Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah ."
[14:24] Speaker_A | That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . So three .
[14:27] Speaker_D | Solar .
[14:30] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[14:31] Speaker_D | So , which number ?"
[14:38] Speaker_A | Do you agree ? Three ?
[14:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[14:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , agree , agree ."
"[14:40] Speaker_D | So reasonably , is four , is one ?"
"[14:42] Speaker_B | Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean ."
"[14:46] Speaker_D | So , three ."
[14:52] Speaker_A | And what's your opinion ?
"[14:54] Speaker_D | Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know ."
[14:54] Speaker_B | Will you give
[14:56] Speaker_B | four ?
[14:59] Speaker_B | Five ?
"[15:07] Speaker_C | Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?"
[15:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:23] Speaker_D | So you have yeah .
[15:32] Speaker_D | Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
"[15:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here ."
[15:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:46] Speaker_B | Are there some buttons ? Okay .
"[15:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one ."
[15:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[15:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , if you're changing your mind ."
[15:59] Speaker_D | Fine to coarse .
[16:00] Speaker_A | Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here .
"[16:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
"[16:03] Speaker_C | Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this ."
[16:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:12] Speaker_C | Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc"
"[16:15] Speaker_D | Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? This has to stay on the table ."
[16:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[16:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:32] Speaker_B | Oh ye yes , that's right ."
[16:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[16:44] Speaker_D | You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand ."
"[16:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . So nobody w will lost lose it ."
"[16:55] Speaker_D | Sure . Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah ."
[17:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:09] Speaker_A | S maybe we can change from th
"[17:10] Speaker_B | Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four ."
[17:11] Speaker_C | Four . Okay .
"[17:12] Speaker_A | Four ? Easy to use , four . Gonna say four ."
[17:13] Speaker_D | Four . Uh it's even easier to maybe .
"[17:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , four it's more reasonable ."
[17:18] Speaker_B | You can you can erase with this er yeah .
[17:22] Speaker_C | Okay .
[17:22] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[17:28] Speaker_B | Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so ."
"[17:30] Speaker_D | So , average ?"
"[17:30] Speaker_B | So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's ."
[17:33] Speaker_D | Three ?
[17:33] Speaker_C | Three ?
"[17:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , especially on the easy to use"
"[17:44] Speaker_B | Yeah , uh s yeah ."
[17:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:45] Speaker_D | target .
[17:46] Speaker_B | Might it might be fine .
"[17:46] Speaker_A | So , th the project is accepted ?"
[17:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[17:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[18:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:16] Speaker_B | That's the finance .
"[18:22] Speaker_A | evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view ."
[18:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:29] Speaker_C | Mm .
[18:30] Speaker_C | Okay .
[18:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:59] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[19:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:10] Speaker_A | sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or such as"
[19:20] Speaker_D | No .
"[19:24] Speaker_B | Yeah , we have battery ."
"[19:26] Speaker_B | No , um solar cells , yeah ."
"[19:36] Speaker_B | Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three three solar cells ."
[19:45] Speaker_A | Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ?
"[19:46] Speaker_B | S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah ."
[19:50] Speaker_A | Zero for the others .
"[19:53] Speaker_A | And sample sensor , sample speaker ."
"[19:58] Speaker_B | Mm . One maybe , yeah ."
[19:58] Speaker_A | One ?
"[20:00] Speaker_A | As we have voice recognition , I think ."
[20:01] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah .
[20:04] Speaker_A | So the case .
[20:08] Speaker_D | So we are all already nineteen .
"[20:18] Speaker_B | Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think ."
"[20:20] Speaker_A | Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved ."
"[20:27] Speaker_D | That's gonna be double curved , yeah ."
"[20:28] Speaker_B | Double curve , yeah , double curve ."
[20:29] Speaker_A | One ?
"[20:31] Speaker_B | One , you have ."
"[20:40] Speaker_D | Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface ."
"[20:41] Speaker_A | Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button ."
"[20:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah ."
"[20:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure ."
"[20:51] Speaker_C | Mm . Yeah , we have four ."
[20:54] Speaker_B | Five ?
[21:00] Speaker_A | Scroll wheel . We don no .
[21:01] Speaker_C | No .
[21:04] Speaker_A | It it's more like integrated scor .
[21:06] Speaker_C | No no .
[21:07] Speaker_D | Yeah tha that's wheel .
"[21:11] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel ."
[21:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
"[21:16] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr"
"[21:19] Speaker_A | So , no button supplements ?"
[21:19] Speaker_D | I think the price is okay .
[21:22] Speaker_C | No .
"[21:23] Speaker_D | Um , no ."
[21:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[21:30] Speaker_B | L_C_ display , maybe . Interface ."
[21:35] Speaker_B | It's okay . fine .
[21:39] Speaker_D | Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
[21:42] Speaker_A | Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
[21:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:50] Speaker_A | Has it changed .
"[21:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , it was stage one , so ."
[21:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:55] Speaker_C | We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .
"[22:06] Speaker_C | We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think ."
[22:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:08] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ?"
"[22:15] Speaker_C | Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . Advanced version we have speak ."
[22:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[22:19] Speaker_B | I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine ."
[22:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:23] Speaker_A | Or it would be better .
[22:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's one of the requirement ."
[22:39] Speaker_A | Because we have red .

"[31:09] Speaker_D | True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still ."
"[31:13] Speaker_A | Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control ."
[31:21] Speaker_D | Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
"[31:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs ."
[31:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:34] Speaker_A | So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ ."

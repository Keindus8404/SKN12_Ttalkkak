[00:21] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . I did anyway . Um let's see .
[00:24] Speaker_D | Good afternoon .
[00:39] Speaker_A | Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components .
[01:01] Speaker_A | Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes .
[01:15] Speaker_A | Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes .
[01:38] Speaker_A | Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
[01:49] Speaker_B | No .
[01:49] Speaker_A | No ? Everything fine ? That's nice .
"[01:54] Speaker_A | Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials ."
"[02:21] Speaker_A | Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out ."
[02:38] Speaker_A | And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers .
"[02:44] Speaker_A | So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations ."
[02:55] Speaker_A | So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?
[03:00] Speaker_D | Sure . I'll start off then .
[03:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:12] Speaker_D | Doh .
"[03:23] Speaker_D | 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires ."
"[03:36] Speaker_D | And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the"
[03:56] Speaker_D | the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .
[04:14] Speaker_D | Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls .
"[04:28] Speaker_D | Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal ."
"[04:54] Speaker_D | 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much"
"[05:11] Speaker_D | the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have ."
[05:30] Speaker_D | Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the
"[05:40] Speaker_D | in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control ."
"[06:03] Speaker_D | So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station ."
[06:24] Speaker_D | This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .
"[06:41] Speaker_D | Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well"
[07:05] Speaker_D | people with less means .
[07:10] Speaker_D | That would be all .
[07:12] Speaker_A | Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Mayb
[07:16] Speaker_D | Any questions ?
[07:18] Speaker_B | Mm no .
"[07:20] Speaker_A | No ? Okay , we go on to the next one ."
[07:44] Speaker_B | Um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh
[08:29] Speaker_B | Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions .
[09:00] Speaker_B | Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting .
"[09:34] Speaker_B | It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah ."
"[10:19] Speaker_B | Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles ."
"[10:32] Speaker_B | Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh"
"[10:52] Speaker_B | Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine ."
[11:06] Speaker_B | Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .
[11:43] Speaker_B | See .
"[12:14] Speaker_B | D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh"
[12:47] Speaker_B | So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh
[13:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:14] Speaker_B | And that's it .
[13:27] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[13:34] Speaker_C | About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option ."
"[13:56] Speaker_C | Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions ."
"[14:13] Speaker_C | Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip ."
"[14:23] Speaker_C | Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen ."
"[14:33] Speaker_C | And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall ."
"[14:49] Speaker_C | Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it ."
[15:15] Speaker_A | Okay . Thank you .
[15:19] Speaker_A | So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .
[15:26] Speaker_A | Mm .
[15:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[15:44] Speaker_A | So these are the points we have to discuss .
[15:49] Speaker_A | Um first
"[15:54] Speaker_A | I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um"
"[16:01] Speaker_A | has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so"
"[16:11] Speaker_A | uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think ."
[16:17] Speaker_C | Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy .
[16:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:34] Speaker_B | Mm .
[16:35] Speaker_A | No .
[16:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
"[16:43] Speaker_C | Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah ."
[16:45] Speaker_D | You use it and it works .
[16:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:48] Speaker_D | Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
[16:48] Speaker_B | Nah .
[16:59] Speaker_D | And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um
[17:03] Speaker_C | Oh .
[17:13] Speaker_D | get great popularity for our product .
[17:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:18] Speaker_D | Um wel
[17:19] Speaker_B | what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries .
"[17:24] Speaker_D | Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there ."
[17:24] Speaker_B | B b
[17:53] Speaker_A | Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
[18:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
[18:10] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
"[18:12] Speaker_A | And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping ."
[18:20] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:34] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[18:36] Speaker_A | And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels ."
[18:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:42] Speaker_B | Uh .
[18:43] Speaker_A | That's safe .
[18:43] Speaker_D | I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
[18:50] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's a good point .
[18:51] Speaker_C | Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .
[18:56] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[18:57] Speaker_D | 'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard ."
"[19:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , sure . Go ahead ."
[19:10] Speaker_D | Um so it was open here .
[19:13] Speaker_D | Um we also um
"[19:18] Speaker_D | asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control"
[19:27] Speaker_A | No .
[19:32] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[19:33] Speaker_D | I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the"
[19:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:43] Speaker_D | younger people .
[19:45] Speaker_C | But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess .
[19:45] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[19:52] Speaker_D | Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use ."
[20:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:11] Speaker_D | And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
[20:11] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[20:16] Speaker_A | Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point ."
"[20:19] Speaker_B | But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?"
[20:30] Speaker_D | Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .
[20:37] Speaker_B | Okay .
[20:38] Speaker_D | So pretty large .
[20:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:43] Speaker_A | I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it ."
[20:50] Speaker_B | No .
[20:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:58] Speaker_A | And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well ."
[21:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[21:33] Speaker_A | So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well ."
[21:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:45] Speaker_C | And that's the best choice .
[21:47] Speaker_A | Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .
[21:55] Speaker_C | Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced .
[21:57] Speaker_A | Just the advanced .
"[22:01] Speaker_A | Okay , advanced chip ."
[22:01] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[22:09] Speaker_A | And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?
[22:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[22:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[22:51] Speaker_D | Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just"
[22:51] Speaker_B | Uh I dunno .
[23:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:03] Speaker_A | That's right .
[23:04] Speaker_D | wood-coloured .
[23:04] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:05] Speaker_A | But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?
[23:08] Speaker_C | Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research .
[23:09] Speaker_A | You don't know ?
[23:11] Speaker_A | I think so because Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .
[23:14] Speaker_D | Probably .
[23:14] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[23:20] Speaker_B | Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So"
[23:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:37] Speaker_A | Change the cases . Yeah .
"[23:39] Speaker_B | maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah ."
[24:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:07] Speaker_A | Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well ."
[24:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:13] Speaker_D | Yeah that is true .
[24:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:21] Speaker_D | Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .
[24:25] Speaker_A | Costs .
[24:28] Speaker_D | 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
"[24:36] Speaker_D | plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one ."
[24:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones
"[24:48] Speaker_A | on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example ."
"[24:56] Speaker_D | Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um"
[25:02] Speaker_A | Remote .
"[25:02] Speaker_D | one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one ."
[25:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[25:10] Speaker_D | So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem ."
[25:14] Speaker_A | So everybody's okay with the changing covers ?
[25:18] Speaker_C | Yes .
[25:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:18] Speaker_A | I think that's a good uh good option .
[25:23] Speaker_A | Changing case covers .
"[25:24] Speaker_D | Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ?"
[25:30] Speaker_C | Yes .
[25:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:33] Speaker_C | Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases ."
[25:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:47] Speaker_D | And what would single curved and double curved mean ?
"[25:49] Speaker_C | Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality ."
[25:59] Speaker_D | Okay .
[26:02] Speaker_D | So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .
"[26:03] Speaker_C | Pick one you like , yes ."
[26:06] Speaker_A | Mm . Okay .
[26:06] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[26:07] Speaker_D | That's good .
[26:14] Speaker_A | It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?
[26:18] Speaker_D | No just to lie down .
[26:20] Speaker_A | And the the cover of the the docking station is also
[26:21] Speaker_D | We'll go for that .
[26:25] Speaker_A | on top of the television then ? Or not ?
[26:27] Speaker_D | Well or besides it .
[26:29] Speaker_A | And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ?
[26:41] Speaker_A | Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the
[26:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:48] Speaker_A | on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or
[26:50] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:04] Speaker_D | Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side ."
[27:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[27:30] Speaker_B | For uh Uh for Yeah yeah .
[27:30] Speaker_D | For left-handed users also .
[27:33] Speaker_A | Yep .
[27:34] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:35] Speaker_B | Yeah we um
"[27:38] Speaker_B | Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or Or isn't it ?"
[27:56] Speaker_D | For the volume . Um well that could
[27:59] Speaker_A | Mm .
[28:07] Speaker_B | Yeah okay .
[28:12] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[28:13] Speaker_D | But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote ."
[28:26] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:26] Speaker_D | 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .
[28:31] Speaker_A | But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused .
[28:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:35] Speaker_D | That is true .
[28:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:37] Speaker_A | Especially if they have the same writings on it .
[28:46] Speaker_A | Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use
[28:53] Speaker_A | on the same
[28:55] Speaker_A | functions as the normal one ?
[29:02] Speaker_A | Let's see if I ca
[29:06] Speaker_A | A blank one .
[29:32] Speaker_A | Here's a little L_C_D_ screen .
[29:37] Speaker_A | Uh now I have to think .
[30:04] Speaker_A | It's a plus and a min .
[30:10] Speaker_B | Mm no .
[30:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:16] Speaker_A | No that's not gonna work .
[30:19] Speaker_A | I guess . Maybe we should Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are
[30:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . That is true .
[30:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:44] Speaker_A | Y yeah . Yeah . I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .
[30:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:51] Speaker_A | Uh but maybe we have to
[30:55] Speaker_A | make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way .
[31:01] Speaker_C | I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on .
[31:06] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
[31:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:11] Speaker_C | So I could draw them out .
[31:19] Speaker_C | Let's look at the flat case .
[31:22] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[31:29] Speaker_C | It's from the side so it's rather normal . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this ."
[31:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[31:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[31:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:47] Speaker_C | So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
[31:51] Speaker_A | Easier ?
[31:58] Speaker_C | And the double curved s looks something like this I guess .
[32:12] Speaker_C | So th those are the three options we have .
[32:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[32:16] Speaker_A | 'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle ."
[32:16] Speaker_D | Mm .
[32:47] Speaker_B | Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There ?
[32:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:53] Speaker_B | So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah .
[32:58] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think so . Yeah .
[33:06] Speaker_A | Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top ?
[33:12] Speaker_A | Okay .
[33:21] Speaker_B | Colour uh okay .
[33:30] Speaker_B | Uh to make this side um like mm
[33:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:46] Speaker_B | So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and
[33:54] Speaker_A | So get your mouse . Yeah .
[33:56] Speaker_B | And to put uh the the buttons for um
[34:06] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top .
[34:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:15] Speaker_A | So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down ."
"[34:30] Speaker_A | Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here ."
[34:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[34:36] Speaker_C | It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above ."
[34:38] Speaker_A | I think i
[34:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:41] Speaker_A | On top .
[34:47] Speaker_C | Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .

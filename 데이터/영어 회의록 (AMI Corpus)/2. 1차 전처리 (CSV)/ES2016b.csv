[00:45] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:50] Speaker_D | Hm .
[00:50] Speaker_A | Thanks for coming to this meeting . S how we doing on our remote ? We have some we have some ideas and some uh
[01:00] Speaker_A | ideas for what people want .
[01:03] Speaker_C | Uh we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . I think .
"[01:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long ."
"[01:23] Speaker_A | Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully ."
"[01:44] Speaker_A | And uh then we'll have the closing . Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um"
"[02:24] Speaker_A | And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want ."
"[02:44] Speaker_A | Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different ."
[03:05] Speaker_A | Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting .
[03:22] Speaker_A | So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation ?
[03:29] Speaker_D | Yep .
[03:35] Speaker_A | Does anyone do you wanna go first ? So we can maybe see what uh what the people want .
[03:38] Speaker_D | Sure .
[03:49] Speaker_D | What was it ? Function ?
[03:51] Speaker_B | Eight . F_ eight .
[03:51] Speaker_D | F_ eight ?
[04:14] Speaker_D | Well .
[04:23] Speaker_C | Slide show .
[04:24] Speaker_A | To go to the next one ? Yeah you click on that guy . Yeah .
[04:24] Speaker_D | Oh right right right .
[04:27] Speaker_D | That one ? Okay .
"[04:30] Speaker_D | Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Oh gosh , I've no idea . G"
[04:47] Speaker_C | Just press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it .
[04:49] Speaker_D | Okay . Sorry I actually need
[04:52] Speaker_D | to see something else on my screen .
[04:59] Speaker_A | Hit F_ eight again .
[05:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:01] Speaker_A | I think .
[05:02] Speaker_D | And then ? Again ?
[05:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[05:07] Speaker_A | You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?"
[05:08] Speaker_D | No I want something else on mine .
[05:12] Speaker_D | Is that possible ?
[05:13] Speaker_A | Yeah but I think you have to hit escape .
[05:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:22] Speaker_D | Okay but now you don't have that .
[05:23] Speaker_A | Oh hit F_ eight again .
[05:29] Speaker_A | And then it should come up
[05:32] Speaker_A | here shortly .
[05:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[05:44] Speaker_D | So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and
[05:46] Speaker_A | I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? Mm . I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then
[05:48] Speaker_D | have something yeah . Yeah . Oh well .
[05:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:56] Speaker_A | have them both up at the same time I think .
"[05:57] Speaker_D | It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research ."
"[06:13] Speaker_D | And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say ."
"[06:42] Speaker_D | And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important ."
[07:12] Speaker_C | Is is it j just just just using it yeah .
"[07:16] Speaker_D | Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently ."
[07:41] Speaker_D | And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button .
"[08:03] Speaker_D | Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote ."
[08:22] Speaker_D | And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
[08:29] Speaker_C | A repetitive strain injury .
[08:31] Speaker_D | What is it ?
[08:32] Speaker_C | Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess .
"[08:34] Speaker_D | Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups ."
"[09:14] Speaker_D | And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room ."
"[09:36] Speaker_D | Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition ."
[09:50] Speaker_D | And that's it .
[10:22] Speaker_A | Wait can I look at that real quick ? .
[10:24] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[10:25] Speaker_D | Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? 'Kay .
[10:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[10:33] Speaker_C | Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say ."
[10:41] Speaker_C | 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design .
"[10:48] Speaker_C | Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control ."
"[11:08] Speaker_C | Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself ,"
"[12:52] Speaker_C | Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across ."
"[13:23] Speaker_C | Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And then and change the fashion of remote controls ."
[13:46] Speaker_C | And that's it .
[14:08] Speaker_A | What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i
[14:11] Speaker_C | On something on the image of it . Uh the f the actual design .
[14:13] Speaker_A | the image of it .
[14:15] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Good . Good .
[15:07] Speaker_B | Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to
[15:45] Speaker_B | This is the basic
"[15:47] Speaker_B | basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is"
[16:12] Speaker_B | the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .
[16:24] Speaker_B | This is where my people screwed up basically . So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ?
"[17:02] Speaker_B | the user interface itself . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact"
[17:14] Speaker_B | controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .
[17:30] Speaker_B | That sends out the signal .
"[17:45] Speaker_B | Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp"
"[17:57] Speaker_B | to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response ."
[18:04] Speaker_B | Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices .
"[18:11] Speaker_B | Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The"
"[18:21] Speaker_B | the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well ."
[19:07] Speaker_B | uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment .
"[19:12] Speaker_B | Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ?"
"[19:37] Speaker_B | Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to"
[19:53] Speaker_B | to the industrial design department .
[19:57] Speaker_B | Expensive it's gonna be get uh . Yeah .
[20:00] Speaker_A | But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . So
[20:07] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:09] Speaker_B | Right .
[20:10] Speaker_A | possibly it might be worth the investment .
[20:12] Speaker_C | I think speech recognition was
[20:16] Speaker_C | uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone .
[20:24] Speaker_A | I agree .
[20:25] Speaker_C | And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well .
"[20:32] Speaker_A | I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over ."
[20:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:52] Speaker_A | I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then"
[20:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:09] Speaker_A | Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? I I don't know ."
[21:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:16] Speaker_D | Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know ."
[21:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[21:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . It'll wear off .
[21:40] Speaker_D | Gets old yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_A | Let's see here .
[21:50] Speaker_C | Do you wanna put your cord back in ?
[21:53] Speaker_A | Yeah I guess so .
[21:55] Speaker_A | Trade you .
[21:58] Speaker_A | Now I was sent a couple of
[22:30] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[22:47] Speaker_A | So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow ."
[23:15] Speaker_A | So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told
[23:47] Speaker_A | And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . S the young the younger people say that they like it . But um it's
[23:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[24:12] Speaker_A | And that way we can focus on our form .
[24:16] Speaker_C | I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that if it came with maybe a holder
"[24:26] Speaker_C | or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought ."
"[24:42] Speaker_A | That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball ."
[24:48] Speaker_D | Mm .
[24:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:06] Speaker_A | With the locator button .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it .
[25:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:20] Speaker_B | W yeah . You put it on t on the couch table . While you're watching , it's gonna roll off . So that's not an issue really ."
[25:51] Speaker_A | So I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . And uh
[25:58] Speaker_A | and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work .
[26:11] Speaker_A | I'll do the minutes .
[26:17] Speaker_A | Uh let's see .
[26:24] Speaker_A | It looks like you're already on your way for uh
"[26:28] Speaker_A | working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need and what uh"
[26:38] Speaker_A | you know how to power it and whatnot .
"[26:45] Speaker_A | User interface concept , we want it to be something simple ."
[26:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:51] Speaker_A | Minimal number of buttons .
"[26:57] Speaker_A | I guess our , I guess our main um"
"[27:02] Speaker_A | main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know ."
[27:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:12] Speaker_B | Right .
[27:16] Speaker_A | Did you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?
"[27:27] Speaker_C | I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break ."
[27:35] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[27:35] Speaker_C | I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . And even something that's held like that might be difficult . So that I think it still has to be a variation .
[27:40] Speaker_D | Mm .
[27:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[27:48] Speaker_C | On maybe a
[27:50] Speaker_C | a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as
"[27:53] Speaker_C | boring , as plain as a rectangle ."
[27:54] Speaker_D | Mm .
[28:01] Speaker_A | Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ?
[28:06] Speaker_A | That way we could l I mean
"[28:08] Speaker_A | if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ?"
[28:24] Speaker_A | Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ?
[28:28] Speaker_A | That we would would wanna pick out ?
[28:33] Speaker_C | D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . I find anything more on that .
[28:38] Speaker_D | Mm .
[28:41] Speaker_D | Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .
[28:51] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[29:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:13] Speaker_B | Mm .
[29:20] Speaker_C | Bottom perhaps yeah .
[29:32] Speaker_A | Maybe we could sketch a so basically
"[30:20] Speaker_C | You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things ."
[30:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[30:28] Speaker_D | Mm .
[30:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:57] Speaker_D | Mm .
[30:59] Speaker_B | Right .
[31:13] Speaker_A | So we've got basically what
[31:17] Speaker_A | remotes look like now is kind of what we're
[31:40] Speaker_B | Hm .
[31:41] Speaker_A | Um you know with minimal number of buttons .
[31:48] Speaker_A | I guess you've got you know one through nine .
[31:54] Speaker_A | For typing in your channels . Uh you've got
"[31:59] Speaker_A | volume , up and down . Channel up and down ."
[32:06] Speaker_D | Power .
[32:07] Speaker_A | Power .
[32:09] Speaker_A | Usually at the top . Um a mute .
[32:19] Speaker_B | That's the classical design .
"[32:28] Speaker_A | A menu button , maybe ."
[32:31] Speaker_B | Right .
[32:31] Speaker_A | So you know .
"[32:34] Speaker_A | If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it ."
[32:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:58] Speaker_B | Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .
"[33:04] Speaker_B | Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So ."
[33:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:19] Speaker_A | Like a wheel on your mouse .
"[33:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , sort of like that . You can even"
[33:22] Speaker_A | Sort of .
"[33:24] Speaker_B | if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down ."
"[33:32] Speaker_B | Right . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on ."
[33:55] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:58] Speaker_A | Look g yeah . Looks good .
[33:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:06] Speaker_B | Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Right . Mm .
[34:09] Speaker_C | Yes s
[34:15] Speaker_A | To the thumb . Yeah .
[34:16] Speaker_C | To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh
"[34:21] Speaker_C | decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here ."
"[34:28] Speaker_B | Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open ."
[34:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:34] Speaker_B | With the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part . And out ."
[34:36] Speaker_C | Behind . Definitely .
[34:45] Speaker_C | Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand
"[34:49] Speaker_B | Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes"
[34:51] Speaker_C | Yeah . Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing .
[34:54] Speaker_B | causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .
[34:58] Speaker_C | Yeah that's also true .
[35:04] Speaker_B | Right .
[35:07] Speaker_C | But I mean the older so
"[35:09] Speaker_A | Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? You guys all right-handed ? Yeah . So I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people ."
[35:13] Speaker_D | Right .
[35:14] Speaker_B | Right .
"[35:14] Speaker_C | Right-handed , yeah ."
[35:17] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[35:27] Speaker_D | Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . Special order .
[35:31] Speaker_A | Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .
[35:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:06] Speaker_C | I mean I'm just just thinking maybe
[36:11] Speaker_C | if it was um
"[36:21] Speaker_C | with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there ."
[36:37] Speaker_C | And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right .
[36:47] Speaker_D | Mm .
[36:49] Speaker_B | Right .
[36:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[36:58] Speaker_B | Then there's maybe
[37:03] Speaker_B | another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller
"[37:11] Speaker_B | a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . That's it ."
[37:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[37:18] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[37:20] Speaker_C | Zapping functions .
[37:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:27] Speaker_D | Could be good .
[38:02] Speaker_A | So two remotes in one .
[38:06] Speaker_A | But then would be easier to lose
[38:11] Speaker_A | one or the other .
[38:13] Speaker_B | That's right .
"[38:14] Speaker_B | Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around ."
"[38:21] Speaker_B | Make it a piece of furniture . yes . Yes , there you go ."
[38:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[38:54] Speaker_C | Yep .
[39:01] Speaker_A | Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . Let's go with our our uh rounded
[39:03] Speaker_B | Right .
[39:19] Speaker_B | Alright .
[39:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[39:36] Speaker_C | How well it'll work yeah .
[39:49] Speaker_A | I dunno . I gu I guess we'll take lunch
[39:54] Speaker_A | in about uh half an hour . Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting .
[40:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[40:03] Speaker_B | Alright .
[40:05] Speaker_A | Okay .

[00:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's okay . That's okay .
[00:47] Speaker_B | Okay .
[00:53] Speaker_A | Am I starting now ?
"[01:33] Speaker_A | So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy ."
"[01:37] Speaker_B | Okay . Um , do I need to plugged in ."
"[01:43] Speaker_C | F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight ."
[01:45] Speaker_B | F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .
[01:48] Speaker_A | No problem .
[01:52] Speaker_B | 'Kay . is on .
"[02:02] Speaker_B | Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . But there we go . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be ."
[02:16] Speaker_A | I'm sure it's fine .
"[02:49] Speaker_B | Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark ."
"[03:29] Speaker_B | Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there ."
"[03:54] Speaker_B | Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart ."
"[04:30] Speaker_B | So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious ."
"[05:01] Speaker_A | Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?"
[05:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:21] Speaker_B | Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else ."
[05:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[06:15] Speaker_A | Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?"
[06:35] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[06:38] Speaker_A | Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive ."
[06:46] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[06:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:16] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:20] Speaker_A | Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .
"[07:28] Speaker_A | Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well ."
[07:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:32] Speaker_B | Okay .
[07:34] Speaker_B | Um also
[07:37] Speaker_B | there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .
"[07:45] Speaker_B | There we go . Sorry , should I go back ."
[07:48] Speaker_B | This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . So I just put all those components in .
[07:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:03] Speaker_B | Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . Okay ?"
[08:18] Speaker_A | Alright . Great .
"[08:20] Speaker_B | So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ?"
[08:25] Speaker_B | There we go .
[08:27] Speaker_B | Okay .
[08:28] Speaker_A | Alright . Thank you very much .
[08:30] Speaker_B | Thank you .
"[08:31] Speaker_A | And , um , the next presenter will be Tara ."
[08:37] Speaker_B | There you go Tara .
[08:38] Speaker_C | Thanks .
[08:44] Speaker_C | Can you see ?
"[09:18] Speaker_C | Is it uh , function eight yeah ?"
[09:20] Speaker_B | Function F_ eight . The one at the top .
[09:20] Speaker_A | Yeah . Function F_ eight . Sorry .
[09:22] Speaker_C | Oh right . Okay .
[09:27] Speaker_D | That looks right .
[09:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:39] Speaker_C | Okay .
[09:43] Speaker_C | I'm the User um
"[10:30] Speaker_C | Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself ."
"[10:33] Speaker_D | Ch Oh , I see ."
[10:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[10:37] Speaker_C | Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing ."
"[10:46] Speaker_C | A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices ."
[11:08] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[11:08] Speaker_C | Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable ."
"[11:25] Speaker_C | Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included ."
[11:41] Speaker_C | So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
"[12:05] Speaker_C | Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices ."
[12:16] Speaker_D | Right .
[12:23] Speaker_D | D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? Okay .
[12:25] Speaker_A | Right .
"[12:27] Speaker_A | Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?"
"[12:35] Speaker_B | Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . And limit the design . Do you think ?"
[12:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[13:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
[13:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[13:12] Speaker_C | And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .
[13:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:22] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[13:24] Speaker_A | Alright . Sounds great .
"[13:25] Speaker_D | Mm , 'kay ."
"[13:26] Speaker_A | Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?"
[13:31] Speaker_D | Yes I am .
[13:32] Speaker_A | Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the Great .
[13:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:58] Speaker_D | Okay .
[14:05] Speaker_D | Oh . I just lost my microphone .
"[14:09] Speaker_D | Just a moment . Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings ."
"[14:49] Speaker_D | Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household ."
"[15:11] Speaker_A | I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?"
"[15:14] Speaker_D | Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control ."
[15:18] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[15:19] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[15:29] Speaker_D | Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user ."
"[15:49] Speaker_A | I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?"
"[15:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting ."
[15:59] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:01] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[16:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[16:25] Speaker_A | Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button ."
[16:26] Speaker_B | Mm .
[16:41] Speaker_D | Yes .
[16:43] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[16:43] Speaker_B | Yeah that's a good point .
"[16:45] Speaker_D | And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set ."
"[17:09] Speaker_D | Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant ."
"[17:33] Speaker_D | Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages ."
[17:55] Speaker_B | It's like the news . Or like information .
"[17:56] Speaker_C | It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . No , li Yeah ."
[18:03] Speaker_B | The and what's on .
[18:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:09] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[18:10] Speaker_C | And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up ."
[18:17] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:19] Speaker_C | Very basic internet , yeah . But you have Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction ."
"[18:21] Speaker_D | Okay . Like tells you the weather , and Okay ."
[18:27] Speaker_D | Right .
[18:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:35] Speaker_D | Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings ."
[18:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:53] Speaker_C | Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? Yeah . Yeah ."
[18:56] Speaker_D | P Sorry . Changing the channels ?
"[19:01] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
"[19:02] Speaker_B | To get the right reception and picture , I suppose ."
[19:04] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay .
[19:05] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[19:07] Speaker_D | Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay ."
"[19:12] Speaker_D | Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ ."
[19:35] Speaker_B | Repetitive strain injury .
[19:35] Speaker_C | Repeti Uh .
[19:37] Speaker_D | Ah . Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?
[19:38] Speaker_B | I think .
"[19:43] Speaker_D | Um , maybe our"
"[19:45] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . I think it is ."
"[19:46] Speaker_D | designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem ."
[19:48] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:57] Speaker_B | Yeah . It is .
[20:00] Speaker_D | Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?
[20:02] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:03] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[20:05] Speaker_D | Um okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here ."
"[20:18] Speaker_D | Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount ."
"[20:34] Speaker_D | Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it ."
"[20:51] Speaker_A | I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned ."
[20:56] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[21:13] Speaker_D | So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . Um and depending on how many members you have in households . So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway ."
[21:20] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[21:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:29] Speaker_D | Right .
[21:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:31] Speaker_B | And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . Yeah ."
[21:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:53] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[22:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure ."
[22:05] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[22:13] Speaker_D | Um okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with ."
[22:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:29] Speaker_A | Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is ."
[22:35] Speaker_C | Mobile phone . Yeah .
"[22:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . Or Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock ."
[22:37] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[22:40] Speaker_B | What , what would appear on the screen ?"
"[22:44] Speaker_D | Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting ."
"[22:48] Speaker_A | Oh , on the remote . Okay ."
[22:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:05] Speaker_B | Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an"
[23:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[23:06] Speaker_C | Yeah . That would be good , yeah ."
"[23:10] Speaker_B | teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television ."
[23:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:17] Speaker_C | Might be quite expensive to do that though .
"[23:21] Speaker_B | Mm , Yeah ."
[23:26] Speaker_A | Right .
[23:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[23:47] Speaker_D | So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe"
[23:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:56] Speaker_B | Mm .
[24:13] Speaker_D | stick to the basics .
[24:14] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[24:14] Speaker_C | And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah ."
[24:20] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[24:27] Speaker_D | Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more ."
"[24:41] Speaker_C | Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . Twenties ."
[24:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:45] Speaker_A | And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem ."
[24:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:00] Speaker_B | Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . Okay .
[25:00] Speaker_D | Yep .
[25:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:04] Speaker_A | Alright .
[25:04] Speaker_D | Okay . That's it for the market research .
"[25:07] Speaker_A | Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Yep ."
[26:06] Speaker_B | Can I just interrupt ?
[26:09] Speaker_B | Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? Okay . Thanks .
"[26:12] Speaker_A | Okay , sure ."
[26:14] Speaker_A | Yeah I do . I'm looking at looking at it right now .
[26:17] Speaker_D | There you go .
"[26:22] Speaker_D | Oh , come back screen ."
[26:28] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[26:33] Speaker_B | Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?"
"[26:41] Speaker_A | Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used ."
[26:51] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:53] Speaker_B | Yeah . Okay .
"[26:56] Speaker_A | Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um"
"[27:06] Speaker_A | more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um"
[27:10] Speaker_B | Right .
[27:16] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[27:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[27:33] Speaker_A | we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable ."
[27:49] Speaker_B | Okay . Work on that .
[27:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:57] Speaker_A | The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . Real Reaction ?
"[27:58] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think ."
[27:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:02] Speaker_A | Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um"
"[28:13] Speaker_A | and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . It'll It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve ."
[28:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[28:39] Speaker_D | Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah ?"
[28:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:43] Speaker_A | Is that how most people feel about that ? Okay .
[28:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:45] Speaker_D | Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition ."
"[29:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous ."
[29:00] Speaker_C | You'd Yeah .
[29:05] Speaker_D | Yeah . Never heard of it .
[29:06] Speaker_C | So is it just Okay . Alright . Right .
[29:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:10] Speaker_A | Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . Do you know if anywhere else has it ?
[29:13] Speaker_C | I don't know .
[29:15] Speaker_C | I don't know .
[29:18] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[29:21] Speaker_A | It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point ."
[29:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:24] Speaker_B | Okay .
[29:24] Speaker_C | Okay then .
[29:25] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[29:27] Speaker_A | So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple ."
"[29:31] Speaker_D | Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons ."
[29:36] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[29:37] Speaker_D | Um .
[29:41] Speaker_D | And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important .
[29:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
[29:51] Speaker_B | Yeah okay .
[29:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:57] Speaker_A | the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . It's not that expensive to do .
"[30:01] Speaker_B | Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah ."
[30:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:07] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[30:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . I like that idea .
"[30:09] Speaker_C | Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for"
"[30:18] Speaker_C | all T_V_s , so"
[30:21] Speaker_C | you'd ha
"[30:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , with the button that you pressed . Yeah ."
[30:24] Speaker_A | Yeah . The button Oh .
"[30:29] Speaker_C | C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something ."
"[30:34] Speaker_B | Maybe Yeah , yeah . Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point ."
"[30:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , it would have t"
[30:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:41] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[30:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Okay ."
[30:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:56] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
[30:58] Speaker_C | Would it need a battery then ?
"[31:02] Speaker_B | Pr probably . Unless it could be Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah ."
"[31:03] Speaker_A | Probably , I mean . That's your department you'll have to sort that out ."
[31:06] Speaker_D | Mm .
[31:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um"
[31:24] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[31:32] Speaker_A | um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ?"
[31:39] Speaker_D | On the buttons ?
"[31:41] Speaker_C | I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so"
[31:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:48] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[31:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[32:07] Speaker_C | Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised ."
"[32:11] Speaker_D | The numbers themselves . But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing ."
[32:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . Could be raised .
"[32:16] Speaker_C | Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?"
[32:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:20] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[32:20] Speaker_D | I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure ."
[32:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[32:26] Speaker_B | That's true . And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody ."
[32:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[32:41] Speaker_C | That , I think that's good , yeah ."
[32:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[32:47] Speaker_A | Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours ."
[32:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:53] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[32:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:59] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[33:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[33:09] Speaker_B | No , it's not these days . I mean , it's quite easily accessible ."
"[33:09] Speaker_C | No , I wouldn't say so ."
[33:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[33:18] Speaker_C | That's good Yeah that a good idea .
[33:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[33:33] Speaker_C | That , yeah , that's a good idea ."
[33:34] Speaker_D | On self timer .
[33:35] Speaker_B | So self-timed lighting .
[33:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:38] Speaker_A | Alright we have five minutes left
"[33:41] Speaker_A | um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?"
"[33:53] Speaker_D | Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again ."
[33:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:07] Speaker_A | Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .
[34:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:19] Speaker_A | Okay , so That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this ."
[34:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:28] Speaker_B | I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . And I think that's un unique as well . I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed ."
[34:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[34:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah ."
"[34:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[34:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[34:39] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? Yeah . Yeah instead of like hard buttons . Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with ."
[34:49] Speaker_B | Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm .
[34:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:10] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[35:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[35:32] Speaker_A | Right . Right .
[35:36] Speaker_A | Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .
"[35:39] Speaker_C | I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised ."
"[35:48] Speaker_B | Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . Or , or the , whate"
[35:48] Speaker_D | Mm .
[35:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[35:52] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[35:55] Speaker_D | That's true .
[35:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:57] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
[36:07] Speaker_A | Alright . So I think that um
[36:19] Speaker_D | What um Oh sorry .
"[36:23] Speaker_D | Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that"
"[36:34] Speaker_D | diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um"
"[36:40] Speaker_B | Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Yeah , or Okay ."
[36:40] Speaker_C | Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?
[36:43] Speaker_A | Like an iPod or something ? Okay .
[36:44] Speaker_C | That would be good . Yeah .
[36:47] Speaker_A | Like a cellphone ? Yeah .
[36:57] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Accessories .
"[36:58] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on ."
[37:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[37:03] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well , that's great ."
[37:04] Speaker_C | That's a good idea . Yeah .
[37:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .
"[37:06] Speaker_B | Interchangeable . Um , als"
"[37:08] Speaker_A | 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . You'd just get one mould ,"
[37:10] Speaker_C | No .
[37:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . Interchan
[37:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[37:23] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
"[37:24] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out ."
[37:24] Speaker_D | Right .
"[37:26] Speaker_B | Yeah . But if we , there is Yeah . We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again ."
[37:28] Speaker_C | If w
"[37:35] Speaker_A | Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? Because we need to investigate the financial implications ."
[37:35] Speaker_D | Right .
[37:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[37:55] Speaker_B | I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then ."
[37:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[37:59] Speaker_A | Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?
[38:03] Speaker_C | No .
[38:04] Speaker_B | No .
"[38:05] Speaker_A | Alright , well ."
[38:06] Speaker_A | Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . Alright ?
[38:08] Speaker_B | Okay . Thank you .

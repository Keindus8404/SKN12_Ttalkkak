[00:02] Speaker_A | All set ?
[00:03] Speaker_A | Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion .
"[00:21] Speaker_A | So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics ."
[00:29] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[00:47] Speaker_A | Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design ."
[01:25] Speaker_B | Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?
[01:28] Speaker_D | Gotta plug you in .
"[01:28] Speaker_A | Oh , right yeah ."
[01:30] Speaker_A | Yep .
[01:40] Speaker_A | Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .
[01:47] Speaker_A | Yep . Cool .
"[01:47] Speaker_B | Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation . So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well ."
[01:54] Speaker_A | Brilliant .
[01:54] Speaker_D | Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .
"[02:41] Speaker_B | So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction ."
[03:13] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[03:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
[03:51] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Fair enough .
[03:56] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[04:11] Speaker_D | Fine .
"[04:32] Speaker_D | It needs , yeah ."
[04:32] Speaker_B | Right .
[04:39] Speaker_B | Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .
"[04:45] Speaker_A | Okay , okay ."
[04:49] Speaker_D | Cool .
[04:50] Speaker_A | Great .
[04:51] Speaker_A | Thank you very much Nathan . Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .
[05:02] Speaker_A | S plug yourself in here .
[05:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
[05:35] Speaker_D | Looks like you're in okay .
[05:36] Speaker_B | Is it plugged in well ?
[05:40] Speaker_B | There it goes . Computer adjusting .
[05:43] Speaker_D | There you go .
[05:43] Speaker_A | There you go . Sweet .
"[05:49] Speaker_C | Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh"
[06:10] Speaker_A | Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .
[06:31] Speaker_C | quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .
[06:43] Speaker_A | Oh yeah look at that .
[06:53] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[07:03] Speaker_C | As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring ."
[07:27] Speaker_C | So my personal preferences . Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh .
[07:54] Speaker_A | Great . Thanks for that Ron .
[07:55] Speaker_D | Right .
[07:58] Speaker_D | Does that mean I'm up ? I think so . Okay . Oh that would be perfect . Thank you .
[08:02] Speaker_C | I can plug you in .
[08:07] Speaker_D | Slide show up and running .
[08:11] Speaker_D | Or not . Uh .
[08:11] Speaker_A | Give it a little bit .
[08:22] Speaker_D | Oh there we go . Perfect .
"[08:24] Speaker_D | Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with ."
[10:06] Speaker_D | the standards . So it's a good start for us .
[10:15] Speaker_D | Need to unplug this ?
[10:17] Speaker_D | Need it back .
[10:20] Speaker_D | There you go .
[11:06] Speaker_D | Oh right .
[11:28] Speaker_A | Yes . So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So
[11:32] Speaker_D | Right .
[11:52] Speaker_D | Right .
[11:55] Speaker_D | Uh .
[11:57] Speaker_A | Um so um .
"[12:02] Speaker_A | How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up ."
[12:11] Speaker_D | Right .
[12:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:22] Speaker_B | Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .
[12:31] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:34] Speaker_B | With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep and
[12:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . Something very basic .
[12:39] Speaker_D | Right .
[12:41] Speaker_B | therefore be found .
[12:42] Speaker_C | Sounds good .
[12:42] Speaker_D | Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?
[12:44] Speaker_B | Oh yeah I think that's very doable .
[12:45] Speaker_D | Okay .
[12:46] Speaker_A | The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up
[12:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:00] Speaker_B | It's a good point .
"[13:00] Speaker_A | If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too ."
[13:09] Speaker_C | A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . And you just say something to into that and it
[13:09] Speaker_D | Mm .
[13:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:16] Speaker_A | Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system ."
[13:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:37] Speaker_D | True .
[13:42] Speaker_D | Making it just an option ? Yeah .
[13:43] Speaker_B | Mm .
[13:48] Speaker_D | Right .
[13:51] Speaker_D | Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . Go ahead .
[13:53] Speaker_B | Oh go ahead .
"[13:54] Speaker_D | The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Okay ."
[13:57] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[14:00] Speaker_C | 'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point ."
[14:05] Speaker_D | Okay .
[14:08] Speaker_D | We're doing okay .
"[14:11] Speaker_D | 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have"
[14:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:18] Speaker_D | menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for ."
[14:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[14:33] Speaker_B | Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . So it's just something to consider ."
[14:40] Speaker_D | True .
[14:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:42] Speaker_D | Worth looking into .
[14:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[14:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:51] Speaker_D | True .
[14:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:57] Speaker_A | Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um ."
[15:24] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[15:34] Speaker_D | Mm .
[15:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:05] Speaker_A | The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?
[16:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:24] Speaker_D | Mm . Just the casing .
[16:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:28] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:40] Speaker_D | Mm .
[16:43] Speaker_A | Mm .
[16:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:52] Speaker_D | Right .
[16:53] Speaker_B | See if there if there's even interest out there . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .
[16:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:55] Speaker_A | Okay . Right .
[17:01] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:09] Speaker_D | Right .
[17:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:18] Speaker_A | Mm . Mm-hmm .
[17:23] Speaker_D | True . True . True .
"[17:27] Speaker_A | Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?"
[17:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[17:35] Speaker_C | Sure .
[18:01] Speaker_C | Interface ?
[18:09] Speaker_A | Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic
[18:49] Speaker_A | Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
[18:58] Speaker_D | True .
[19:04] Speaker_D | 'Cause it would have a docking base ?
[19:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Hmm .
[19:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:11] Speaker_C | So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?
[19:15] Speaker_A | Do they ? Okay .
[19:16] Speaker_C | Those new ones .
[19:17] Speaker_D | Can we afford that ?
[19:17] Speaker_B | Can we afford to include one of those ?
[19:22] Speaker_A | Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Okay so let's go with a um touch screen
[19:28] Speaker_D | Right .
"[19:43] Speaker_A | Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know . Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation ."
[19:46] Speaker_D | It is .
[19:48] Speaker_D | Fair enough .
[19:50] Speaker_D | The basics .
[20:03] Speaker_D | Mm .
[20:09] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[20:14] Speaker_A | Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um"
[20:26] Speaker_B | Right .
[20:30] Speaker_A | and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .
[20:43] Speaker_B | Okay .
[20:46] Speaker_A | Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .
"[20:55] Speaker_B | Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody ."
[21:10] Speaker_C | Be interesting .
[21:11] Speaker_D | Mm .
[21:12] Speaker_B | What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
"[21:19] Speaker_B | logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said ."
[21:22] Speaker_C | We put fashion into electronics .
[21:28] Speaker_A | W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um
[21:40] Speaker_B | 'S too much .
[21:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_D | For now .
"[21:58] Speaker_A | I dunno , what do you guys think ?"
[22:02] Speaker_B | Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . That'd be okay .
[22:04] Speaker_D | Yeah . Nice .
"[22:08] Speaker_C | Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device ."
[22:10] Speaker_D | Um .
[22:18] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[22:25] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:26] Speaker_D | Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .
[22:30] Speaker_B | Mm . True .
[22:31] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[22:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:39] Speaker_A | Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .
[22:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[22:43] Speaker_D | Yeah you would think . But .
[22:44] Speaker_A | But apparently not . So .
[22:45] Speaker_B | People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . They just want it to be on and ready to go .
[22:45] Speaker_D | If it comes from above .
[22:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:05] Speaker_C | Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .
[23:07] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[23:08] Speaker_A | Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . Okay . Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um ."
[23:22] Speaker_A | Um cool so any last things before we break ?
[23:28] Speaker_A | Alright . Fair enough .
[23:30] Speaker_A | Sounds good .
[23:30] Speaker_D | We're good ?
[23:32] Speaker_A | I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .
[23:40] Speaker_C | I've put my files in the shared folder as well .
[23:42] Speaker_A | Brilliant .
[23:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .

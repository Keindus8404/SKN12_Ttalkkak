"[01:32] Speaker_A | Okay , thanks ."
[01:36] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[01:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , same here ."
[01:42] Speaker_D | Oh . Sorry .
[01:46] Speaker_B | Uh let's see . Which one was mine ?
"[01:49] Speaker_A | So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough ."
"[01:59] Speaker_A | Okay , perfect . So we have Oh no , what's that ?"
"[02:06] Speaker_A | So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,"
[02:10] Speaker_B | Good .
"[02:16] Speaker_A | that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you ."
"[02:27] Speaker_A | Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one ."
[02:31] Speaker_A | How do I escape this ?
[02:33] Speaker_C | What ?
[02:34] Speaker_A | How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?
"[02:38] Speaker_A | Ah okay . And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one ."
[02:39] Speaker_C | Just Yeah .
[03:04] Speaker_B | Okay .
[03:16] Speaker_A | All these points uh we have to
[03:18] Speaker_A | look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main
"[03:26] Speaker_A | uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno ."
"[03:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
[03:54] Speaker_B | Which one first ?
[03:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[03:57] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:00] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[04:11] Speaker_B | Functional requirements , yeah ."
"[04:20] Speaker_D | Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've"
[04:32] Speaker_D | used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .
"[04:43] Speaker_A | I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , I didn't get it uh anyway . It's only for you ."
[04:45] Speaker_D | You didn't read it ?
"[04:46] Speaker_B | No , I didn don't thing we got it . Yes ."
"[04:47] Speaker_D | Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . Okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users ."
[04:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:58] Speaker_D | And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .
[05:08] Speaker_D | So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .
"[05:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy ."
[05:36] Speaker_D | I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
"[05:56] Speaker_D | Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements ."
[06:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:24] Speaker_D | I don't think it's uh
[06:26] Speaker_D | reachable .
"[06:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something ."
[06:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:46] Speaker_D | Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly ."
[06:55] Speaker_B | Uh .
[06:56] Speaker_B | Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .
"[07:02] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this ."
"[07:14] Speaker_D | It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think ."
"[07:31] Speaker_D | Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point ."
"[07:45] Speaker_D | Okay , last page . Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that ."
[08:02] Speaker_D | Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical .
[08:31] Speaker_A | So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
[08:33] Speaker_D | But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?
[08:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:46] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's too Okay .
[08:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:54] Speaker_D | I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this ."
"[09:06] Speaker_D | Um my point is , well , I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise ."
"[09:20] Speaker_A | Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably ."
"[09:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special ."
"[09:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it ."
"[09:36] Speaker_D | Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it ."
[09:44] Speaker_D | And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a a new product . We have to be um Yeah .
"[10:04] Speaker_D | One of a kind , I think ."
[10:07] Speaker_B | Unique .
[10:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:13] Speaker_A | But old people are not looking for that .
[10:16] Speaker_A | Not really .
"[10:17] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . Yeah ."
[10:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it , yes ."
[10:23] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah .
[10:40] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
"[10:42] Speaker_D | Okay , this was uh my presentation ."
[10:44] Speaker_A | Thanks .
[10:45] Speaker_C | Okay .
[10:48] Speaker_D | I don't Yeah . You can ask some questions or something .
"[10:49] Speaker_A | So Paul , you can do the next one if you want ."
[10:54] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[10:54] Speaker_A | It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , isn't it ?"
[10:57] Speaker_B | There it is .
[11:06] Speaker_B | Okay . Technical functions design .
"[11:10] Speaker_B | Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard ."
"[11:24] Speaker_B | So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used ."
"[11:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , I have it on the next page . But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it ."
[11:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:07] Speaker_B | Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or
"[12:16] Speaker_B | just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control"
[12:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:24] Speaker_B | to find out . But there is already in a
"[12:28] Speaker_B | one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to ."
[12:36] Speaker_B | Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options .
[12:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number ."
[13:06] Speaker_C | Or not ?
[13:07] Speaker_B | No y
"[13:09] Speaker_B | Well it's It was just a thought . So I'm , I u I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six ."
"[13:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?"
[13:38] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
"[13:46] Speaker_C | Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel ."
"[14:00] Speaker_A | Uh mayb for me it's If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never ."
[14:00] Speaker_B | Well i
[14:05] Speaker_B | Never ? Oh .
"[14:05] Speaker_C | No , neither do I ."
[14:06] Speaker_B | Oh are you ?
"[14:08] Speaker_B | Okay now , m maybe not ."
"[14:13] Speaker_B | No , maybe elderly people uh . Right . They don't like new features . So maybe not ."
"[14:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno ."
[14:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[14:24] Speaker_B | Not anymore for T_V_ . Right , on off . I dunno , miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?"
"[14:33] Speaker_B | I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ ."
"[14:36] Speaker_A | Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need ."
"[14:39] Speaker_C | Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ? I don't thi"
[14:47] Speaker_D | Forward .
"[14:48] Speaker_C | Li like a web browser , so Oh , okay . But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before ."
[14:48] Speaker_B | Six seven eight or five .
[14:51] Speaker_A | Just very simple .
[14:58] Speaker_C | Like a web browser back button .
"[15:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[15:09] Speaker_B | Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time ."
[15:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:28] Speaker_B | Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other ."
[15:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:34] Speaker_B | To just keep it simple and standard uh features .
[15:44] Speaker_B | Uh yeah mayb But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um
[15:45] Speaker_D | It gets some seconds .
[15:55] Speaker_B | two two st two stripes . So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Oh okay . Yeah .
[16:01] Speaker_D | It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .
[16:12] Speaker_C | Okay .
[16:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:33] Speaker_A | But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f No .
[16:36] Speaker_D | It's only for television now .
[16:40] Speaker_D | No .
[16:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:54] Speaker_B | But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have"
[16:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:00] Speaker_B | four arrows .
"[17:23] Speaker_B | Yeah , a mute button . Yes . Don't think so ."
"[17:25] Speaker_A | Maybe , not I don't know where where you have to put it ."
"[17:29] Speaker_B | Yeah well , that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . And later we can d uh do the design ."
[17:35] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .
[17:35] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:45] Speaker_B | Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design ."
"[17:52] Speaker_B | So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see"
[18:03] Speaker_B | all the same uh remote controls .
[18:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well why not ? Or Yeah .
[18:20] Speaker_D | That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .
"[18:27] Speaker_B | Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Oh ."
"[18:29] Speaker_A | Oh , you just I dunno what happened ."
[18:32] Speaker_B | Who ?
"[18:38] Speaker_B | They they're uh designed very well . And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it ."
[18:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:51] Speaker_B | But uh well , I think that's a good example ."
[18:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:55] Speaker_A | Okay , we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . Is it fin Are you finished ? Okay ."
"[18:57] Speaker_B | Okay , sorry . Well uh Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything ."
[19:13] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[19:15] Speaker_C | Well , the working design ."
[19:18] Speaker_C | The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided .
"[19:27] Speaker_C | Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch ."
"[19:44] Speaker_C | And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern ."
"[19:59] Speaker_C | Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible"
[20:21] Speaker_C | to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .
[20:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:45] Speaker_A | So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
[20:47] Speaker_C | Yeah . I I think so . I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .
[20:49] Speaker_B | Uh j Is Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?
"[20:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's I think it's usable ."
"[20:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's active ."
"[20:54] Speaker_A | Yeah . Or just a green one , because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green ."
[20:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:07] Speaker_C | Two ?
"[21:07] Speaker_A | Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button ."
[21:11] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[21:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , I know . Okay , we make it red ."
[21:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:18] Speaker_B | Yes .
[21:19] Speaker_C | So I know .
[21:19] Speaker_B | But maybe Well we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .
[21:38] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[21:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . It's just to indicate something's on ."
[21:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:46] Speaker_C | Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .
"[21:47] Speaker_B | Yeah . It's it's not very important , so yeah ."
"[21:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working ."
"[21:54] Speaker_C | And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work ."
"[22:18] Speaker_C | No . I I uh The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to Yeah . That are working ."
[22:27] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[22:29] Speaker_D | An automatically search function for each television , or something ."
"[22:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there ."
[22:37] Speaker_D | Uh I kno
"[22:37] Speaker_B | Well , I I use a universal uh remote control , and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ ."
[22:49] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
[22:51] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[22:52] Speaker_D | Oh , I have a modern one . And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , and then it's okay ."
[23:08] Speaker_C | Ah okay .
[23:09] Speaker_D | So you don't have to search for your television or your code . It uh search uh the pattern for itself .
[23:12] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[23:16] Speaker_B | Okay , so we use that ."
"[23:16] Speaker_C | Okay , yeah . So it uh We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to Yeah ."
[23:22] Speaker_D | Yes .
[23:22] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[23:28] Speaker_C | Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip . That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different ."
[23:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:33] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[23:41] Speaker_C | So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically ."
[23:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:00] Speaker_D | Changing the signal .
"[24:06] Speaker_C | What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working ."
[24:21] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah .
"[24:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's the right uh option ."
[24:25] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[24:27] Speaker_C | Well uh the components . Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time ."
"[24:36] Speaker_C | Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . Um that's connecting to all the components ."
[24:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:50] Speaker_C | Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w
"[24:58] Speaker_C | I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed ."
[25:06] Speaker_C | Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed .
[25:13] Speaker_C | And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .
"[25:24] Speaker_A | Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ ."
"[25:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too . But this one is producing infrared light that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light ."
"[25:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
"[25:33] Speaker_A | So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one ."
"[25:41] Speaker_D | Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button ."
[25:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:59] Speaker_A | Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .
"[26:06] Speaker_C | Huh , that's a good idea ."
[26:06] Speaker_D | Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .
"[26:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . And it's you also know which button you p"
"[26:10] Speaker_B | No , y Yeah ."
[26:13] Speaker_D | Okay . But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .
[26:20] Speaker_D | Everywhere in the r
[26:21] Speaker_A | But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .
"[26:25] Speaker_B | No I don't think so , but Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . Yeah ."
"[26:31] Speaker_A | That looks different , yeah ."
[26:33] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[26:38] Speaker_D | Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?
"[26:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even ."
"[26:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[26:53] Speaker_D | It must be around it then .
"[26:58] Speaker_D | Yeah , then Yeah . Not not not not here , but here ."
[27:03] Speaker_C | Yeah . There . Yeah .
"[27:09] Speaker_B | Yeah , we're thinking about it . Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh"
[27:12] Speaker_A | It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .
[27:14] Speaker_B | everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?
[27:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:16] Speaker_A | It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .
[27:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
[27:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:21] Speaker_A | It's f Yeah . Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .
"[27:23] Speaker_B | Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote ."
[27:24] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:27] Speaker_A | It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .
"[27:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's a good idea , okay ."
"[27:39] Speaker_A | Everything agre Everyone agrees with that , or Okay ."
[27:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:42] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[27:43] Speaker_D | Maybe what Paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps ."
"[27:50] Speaker_A | Okay , yeah ."
[27:52] Speaker_A | But you have to make a sound device in it then .
"[27:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , there must be sound in it ."
[27:56] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[27:56] Speaker_A | But Yeah .
[27:57] Speaker_D | I dunno .
[27:58] Speaker_C | Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make .
[28:03] Speaker_C | Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .
"[28:05] Speaker_D | Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . Bec"
[28:07] Speaker_B | Uh I th
"[28:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[28:24] Speaker_D | Uh .
[28:26] Speaker_D | We have to give our customers some extras .
[28:29] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think we will save money with that .
"[28:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[28:37] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay . No worry .
[28:42] Speaker_C | Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .
"[28:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , I just want to talk some about some more . So maybe you have to Yeah ? Okay ."
[28:49] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Okay .
"[29:02] Speaker_A | So this Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ?"
"[29:32] Speaker_C | No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use ."
[29:32] Speaker_D | No .
[29:38] Speaker_D | Uh .
[29:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:38] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[29:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier ."
"[29:48] Speaker_A | And um the the forty plus people , I already told you ."
"[29:56] Speaker_A | Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well ."
[30:07] Speaker_D | Okay .
[30:07] Speaker_C | Oh . Mm .
"[30:08] Speaker_B | Okay , that's It changes things ."
[30:14] Speaker_D | Changes .
"[30:21] Speaker_B | Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern ."
[30:28] Speaker_A | That still stays .
[30:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:34] Speaker_D | L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .
"[30:37] Speaker_B | And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it ."
[30:43] Speaker_D | Oh .
[30:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:58] Speaker_C | No .
"[31:04] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think ."
[31:19] Speaker_D | But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? That's very That's fancy . That's cool . Twelve and you've got twelve .
[31:32] Speaker_B | It's very fashion .
[31:33] Speaker_C | I didn't read any b Yeah . Yeah okay .
"[31:36] Speaker_D | Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . That should be cool ."
[31:36] Speaker_B | Mm .
[31:36] Speaker_C | I I know .
[31:42] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[31:43] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well ."
"[31:47] Speaker_D | If it's possible , I dunno . I didn't read it ."
"[31:48] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know ."
[31:48] Speaker_A | I don't think it's very expensive actually . Why should it ? You only have a microphone in it .
[31:49] Speaker_B | Mm .
[31:51] Speaker_D | Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that .
[32:02] Speaker_C | And and uh w Yeah ?
[32:02] Speaker_D | Uh only in English . Only in English I think .
[32:04] Speaker_B | What But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever
[32:12] Speaker_B | uh one to have in channel one ?
"[32:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do do we do it ? It's more if we if we do it ."
"[32:17] Speaker_B | Yeah , I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at ."
[32:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno ."
[32:32] Speaker_D | Okay .
[32:32] Speaker_A | We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .
[32:39] Speaker_D | In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .
[32:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:43] Speaker_B | I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .
[32:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think so .
[32:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:00] Speaker_C | the remote away .
"[33:02] Speaker_C | Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay ."
"[33:10] Speaker_C | Hmm yeah ,"
[33:12] Speaker_C | T_V_ one .
"[33:12] Speaker_D | Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition ."
[33:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:18] Speaker_B | Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough ."
[33:22] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[33:23] Speaker_A | So we have to make some decisions . So you can see on the uh So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?"
"[33:24] Speaker_D | Okay , no speech recognition ."
"[33:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think so ."
"[33:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's good ."
[33:41] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[33:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it's Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . If you push something , it it all lights up ."
[33:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[33:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah yeah , it it mustn't work all the time . It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . So if you No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off ."
"[33:56] Speaker_B | Yes , that's what I mean ."
[33:59] Speaker_A | Or you can switch it on or something .
[34:01] Speaker_B | Or maybe when you yeah .
[34:03] Speaker_B | It lights up all .
"[34:04] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right . You have to Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah ."
"[34:06] Speaker_B | Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah ."
"[34:11] Speaker_A | And do we use a a Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control ."
"[34:20] Speaker_C | Mm , maybe it's a good idea ."
"[34:20] Speaker_B | Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts ."
[34:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:27] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[34:28] Speaker_B | Like uh phones .
"[34:29] Speaker_A | Different colours . Okay , so y you just make it th through You look through it ? Okay ."
[34:30] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[34:30] Speaker_D | A see-through . Mm , that's cool ."
[34:32] Speaker_B | Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .
"[34:35] Speaker_A | And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there ."
[34:43] Speaker_D | But you have You had a lot of different buttons .
"[34:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons ."
[34:45] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[34:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one ."
[35:01] Speaker_A | O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .
"[35:07] Speaker_B | No , I don't need don't need Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something ."
"[35:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right ."
[35:22] Speaker_B | I use teletext as well .
"[35:22] Speaker_D | No , I use te teletext every day , I think ."
[35:25] Speaker_C | Hmm . Okay .
"[35:26] Speaker_A | Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay ."
"[35:30] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much ."
[35:30] Speaker_D | Mm .
[35:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[35:40] Speaker_B | 'Cause simple buttons . If you put one above it , it's clear ."
[35:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
[35:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[35:56] Speaker_B | How long is lunch break ?
"[35:59] Speaker_A | So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it ."

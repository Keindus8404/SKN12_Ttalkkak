"[01:09] Speaker_C | Alright , okay , yeah ."
[01:13] Speaker_C | He's gonna get his pen .
[01:14] Speaker_D | Oh right . Okay .
[01:15] Speaker_C | Um Will you guys first with your prototype
[01:21] Speaker_C | um before we get to the good news ?
"[01:26] Speaker_A | Yeah , there's good news ? Oh ."
[01:27] Speaker_C | Uh we have budget problems .
[01:28] Speaker_D | Mm .
[01:32] Speaker_A | Oh .
[01:34] Speaker_A | Cutbacks .
[01:38] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[02:00] Speaker_C | Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show ."
[02:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[02:02] Speaker_B | No , not mine yet ."
[02:04] Speaker_A | Oh .
[02:06] Speaker_A | Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah .
[02:09] Speaker_D | Okay . Sure .
[02:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[02:15] Speaker_D | We made three for you .
[02:16] Speaker_C | Three ? Oh .
"[02:19] Speaker_D | Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st"
"[02:29] Speaker_D | Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition ."
[02:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[02:46] Speaker_C | Logo .
"[02:48] Speaker_C | Okay , brilliant ."
[02:54] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[02:57] Speaker_C | Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah ."
[03:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[03:02] Speaker_D | Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want ."
"[03:06] Speaker_C | Alright , okay ."
[03:15] Speaker_C | Right .
"[03:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure . Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate ."
[03:26] Speaker_C | At Oh dear .
"[03:29] Speaker_D | That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan ."
"[03:32] Speaker_C | Alright , okay ."
"[03:39] Speaker_C | Okay , brilliant mm ."
"[03:43] Speaker_C | Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah ."
"[03:44] Speaker_D | Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that ."
"[03:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed ."
"[03:56] Speaker_C | Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre ."
"[04:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition ."
[04:22] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[04:23] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
[04:24] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[04:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah ."
[04:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[04:39] Speaker_D | Um and um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . We used those . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place ."
[05:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[05:02] Speaker_C | No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so ."
[05:05] Speaker_C | Excellent .
[05:06] Speaker_D | So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too .
"[05:12] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , yeah ."
"[05:14] Speaker_A | This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences ."
"[05:18] Speaker_C | Okay , so so Barney the banana ."
"[05:26] Speaker_C | Ah excellent , just what we need ."
[05:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:29] Speaker_A | Say it for the camera .
[05:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[05:35] Speaker_A | Right , right ."
[05:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:46] Speaker_A | It won't stand .
"[05:47] Speaker_C | Oh there are issues , oh there are issues ."
[05:52] Speaker_C | Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
[05:57] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[05:58] Speaker_C | Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um unfortunately"
"[06:06] Speaker_C | the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros ."
[06:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:15] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[06:16] Speaker_C | So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . There we go ."
[06:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:28] Speaker_C | Oh god , why is it doing that ?"
[06:28] Speaker_D | Ooh .
"[06:32] Speaker_C | There we go . So basically , um in order to save our two Euros"
[06:45] Speaker_C | um I was thinking
"[06:47] Speaker_C | that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened ."
[06:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control .
[06:53] Speaker_C | Um .
"[06:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much ."
[06:57] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:08] Speaker_C | I don't know what's going on with this again .
[07:10] Speaker_A | W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
"[07:14] Speaker_C | Oh , good point ."
[07:17] Speaker_B | And double curve on both sides ?
[07:18] Speaker_C | Um .
"[07:22] Speaker_B | Curve . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It This one is single curve ."
[07:23] Speaker_C | That's sort of curve in and out .
[07:25] Speaker_A | Is i
[07:29] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[07:29] Speaker_B | 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides ."
[07:33] Speaker_B | So double-curve .
"[07:33] Speaker_C | No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though ."
[07:36] Speaker_D | Like an S_ shape .
[07:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[07:48] Speaker_B | Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm ."
"[07:51] Speaker_C | I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape ."
[07:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[07:55] Speaker_C | A curvature is like the this case .
[07:56] Speaker_B | Maybe .
[07:58] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[08:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however ."
[08:10] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[08:11] Speaker_C | Right . No .
[08:16] Speaker_A | But you think it should be one .
"[08:18] Speaker_C | It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again ."
[08:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:38] Speaker_C | Oh that's fine .
[08:40] Speaker_C | Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
[08:40] Speaker_D | Cool .
[08:42] Speaker_D | Cool .
[08:45] Speaker_D | So we could even add something .
"[08:47] Speaker_C | We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ?"
[08:49] Speaker_A | We should fire the accountants .
"[09:00] Speaker_A | Ah yeah , we could add things ."
"[09:03] Speaker_A | Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm ."
[09:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know ."
"[09:11] Speaker_B | Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute ."
"[09:20] Speaker_C | It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know ."
"[09:26] Speaker_B | Okay . No input , like this . Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?"
"[09:31] Speaker_C | No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something ."
[09:35] Speaker_A | Is it the other shift button maybe ?
[09:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:49] Speaker_C | Cancel . Piss off .
[09:52] Speaker_A | That's too bad .
"[09:55] Speaker_C | Oh well , never mind . Um ."
"[09:59] Speaker_C | Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ?"
"[10:06] Speaker_D | Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now ."
[10:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:29] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
"[10:31] Speaker_C | Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ?"
[10:42] Speaker_C | Are we happy ?
[10:43] Speaker_A | Oh .
[10:43] Speaker_D | Mm .
[10:44] Speaker_A | Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
[10:54] Speaker_C | Evaluation .
[10:58] Speaker_C | Oh we've been writing this up for m months .
[10:59] Speaker_D | I think it went quite smoothly .
"[11:04] Speaker_C | Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?"
[11:07] Speaker_D | W I think we were very creative .
"[11:09] Speaker_C | No , I mea I think it means sort of individually ."
"[11:12] Speaker_D | Oh right , okay ."
"[11:15] Speaker_C | Yes , no , maybe ? Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry ."

"[11:34] Speaker_C | Uh and well means , yeah . The technical stuff was brilliant . Let's buy more . Uh Right . Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest ."
[11:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:00] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .

[12:07] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[12:11] Speaker_D | Okay . Well um .
[12:11] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[12:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[12:27] Speaker_A | Right , right ."
[12:32] Speaker_A | Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay .
"[12:37] Speaker_C | Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable ."
[12:43] Speaker_A | Something we should get .
[12:43] Speaker_C | I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying .
"[12:47] Speaker_B | Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? Uh mine needs also this ."
[12:48] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .

"[13:32] Speaker_D | It's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . I've got ."
"[13:39] Speaker_C | O okay , hold on ."
[14:03] Speaker_A | It's fun to touch .
[14:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:33] Speaker_D | Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you .
"[14:37] Speaker_B | So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this ."
[14:42] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[15:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[15:06] Speaker_B | We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s"
[15:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[16:04] Speaker_B | Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board ."
[16:07] Speaker_C | Okay .
[16:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[16:15] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[16:16] Speaker_C | Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ?"
[16:22] Speaker_A | Do we have the uh the marker for the board ?
[16:25] Speaker_D | Um .
[16:27] Speaker_A | There it is .
[16:32] Speaker_B | So .
[18:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[18:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So ."
[18:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:39] Speaker_C | When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet ."
"[18:47] Speaker_D | I would say seven . Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't True or false ? No sorry tr one is true ."
"[18:54] Speaker_C | One , yeah ."
"[18:57] Speaker_B | Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?"
[18:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:02] Speaker_C | No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth"
[19:03] Speaker_A | No that's false .
"[19:04] Speaker_B | Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?"
"[19:06] Speaker_D | Okay , so one ."
[19:10] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[19:20] Speaker_B | Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?"
[19:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[19:36] Speaker_A | Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um ."
[19:41] Speaker_A | But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .
[19:45] Speaker_A | Um I'm gonna give it a two . Two .
"[19:47] Speaker_B | Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . So ."
[19:54] Speaker_C | Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
[20:18] Speaker_D | Mm yellow .
[20:26] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[20:31] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[20:35] Speaker_D | Okay .
[20:41] Speaker_D | Is that no is that not trends ?
"[20:44] Speaker_B | Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also ."
[21:01] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:16] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
"[21:20] Speaker_D | But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product ."
[21:51] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe ."
[22:06] Speaker_C | Six . Five or six .
[22:08] Speaker_D | What are we doing ?
"[22:09] Speaker_B | No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends ."
[22:09] Speaker_A | What are we doing ?
[22:10] Speaker_D | Adding them up ?
[22:11] Speaker_A | We're gonna average them ?
[22:14] Speaker_A | Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight .
[22:14] Speaker_D | Oh .
[22:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[22:23] Speaker_D | Okay .
[22:26] Speaker_C | Oh I see .
[22:28] Speaker_A | Yeah round it up to two . So trends .
"[22:30] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah ."
[22:34] Speaker_A | Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
[22:37] Speaker_B | Sorry ?
[22:38] Speaker_A | How it how conforms to the current trends ?
"[22:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh ."
[22:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[22:49] Speaker_D | Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine ."
"[23:24] Speaker_A | 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons ,"
[23:38] Speaker_A | um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
[23:48] Speaker_D | Mm .
[23:49] Speaker_A | for technology .
"[23:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might"
"[23:58] Speaker_C | it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well ."
[24:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:11] Speaker_B | Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them ."
[24:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[24:41] Speaker_B | So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen . So we can Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?"
[24:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:25] Speaker_D | Um .
"[25:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy"
[25:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[25:47] Speaker_A | Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ?"
[25:52] Speaker_D | Okay . Is it ? Okay .
"[25:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[25:56] Speaker_A | Um .
"[25:56] Speaker_D | Okay , so"
"[25:59] Speaker_D | one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine ."
[26:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:04] Speaker_A | I'll go with two .
"[26:07] Speaker_B | So what about you , Brian ?"
"[26:09] Speaker_C | Um yeah , a three ."
[26:21] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[26:23] Speaker_B | Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six"
"[26:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , one ."
[26:50] Speaker_B | half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven .
[26:54] Speaker_A | A two .
"[27:07] Speaker_B | Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two ."

[00:08] Speaker_A | Right well .
[00:09] Speaker_A | Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh
"[00:18] Speaker_A | we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um"
[00:36] Speaker_A | Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh
[00:48] Speaker_A | uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um
[00:59] Speaker_A | So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals .
"[01:05] Speaker_B | Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on ."
[01:29] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[01:29] Speaker_B | Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um ."
"[01:37] Speaker_A | Yep , yeah , good , good ."
"[01:44] Speaker_A | Uh-huh . Yep , right ."
[01:50] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[01:51] Speaker_C | Mm . S
"[01:57] Speaker_A | Yep , yep , mm-hmm ."
"[02:00] Speaker_C | And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over ."
[02:04] Speaker_B | Mm .
[02:04] Speaker_A | Uh-huh . Yep yep .
[02:08] Speaker_A | Yep .
[02:14] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[02:20] Speaker_A | Uh-huh . Okay , yep , right ."
[02:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:30] Speaker_B | But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine .
[02:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
[02:36] Speaker_C | just kinda stretch it over
[02:36] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[02:39] Speaker_A | Okay , good yeah ."
[02:39] Speaker_C | and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .
[02:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[02:48] Speaker_A | Yep , right ."
"[02:49] Speaker_B | Li that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah ."
"[02:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? Right ."
[02:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:58] Speaker_C | Like that .
"[03:06] Speaker_B | Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that ."
"[03:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , standing ."
"[03:23] Speaker_B | Yeah , we could just widen it out uh"
[03:31] Speaker_B | Mm . Mm .
"[03:38] Speaker_D | Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player ."
"[03:38] Speaker_B | Mm , yeah , yeah . Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there ."
"[03:39] Speaker_A | Yeah , well ."
[03:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:46] Speaker_C | Or just make it little .
"[03:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , mm . Yeah . Yeah ."
[03:48] Speaker_C | Somewhere like that
"[03:52] Speaker_B | We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . Yeah ."
[03:52] Speaker_D | Yeah I kinda had a
[03:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[04:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . Um , so good that's that that's excellent . Um right let us um"
[04:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[04:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:17] Speaker_C | 'S a little longer .
[04:23] Speaker_B | Mm .
[04:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:36] Speaker_A | What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um"
"[04:42] Speaker_A | f finance . Um , now"
"[04:49] Speaker_A | we're given a a clear design brief , uh"
[04:58] Speaker_A | if I get the uh spreadsheet up .
[05:03] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[05:09] Speaker_D | Uh yeah , just click there ."
[05:12] Speaker_D | Uh the
[05:13] Speaker_D | the maximise button .
[05:15] Speaker_A | Oh right . Ah .
"[05:19] Speaker_A | Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um"
"[06:01] Speaker_A | we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um"
[06:36] Speaker_A | l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh
[07:06] Speaker_A | we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um
"[07:50] Speaker_A | uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um ."
[07:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[08:11] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[08:32] Speaker_A | Okay , uh ."
[08:37] Speaker_A | So um .
[08:40] Speaker_A | Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um
[08:47] Speaker_A | the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ?
[08:48] Speaker_D | Evaluation .
[08:55] Speaker_A | The the the well the I meant the product .
"[09:02] Speaker_A | Yeah . Oh sorry yeah um , mm ."
[09:08] Speaker_D | Cheers .
[09:13] Speaker_A | More loud clicks in the microphone .
[09:32] Speaker_D | Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to
"[09:42] Speaker_D | set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So"
"[09:47] Speaker_D | what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard"
[09:53] Speaker_D | um gauge
"[09:54] Speaker_D | our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false ."
[10:09] Speaker_D | And then at the end just take an average
[10:12] Speaker_A | On for true and seven for flase .
[10:16] Speaker_D | Yes .
[10:17] Speaker_A | Yes .
[10:27] Speaker_D | So uh .
[10:43] Speaker_A | Well I think most definitely .
[10:44] Speaker_B | Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah .
[10:44] Speaker_C | I think it is yeah .
[10:48] Speaker_D | So uh and also uh technologically innovative ?
[10:52] Speaker_A | Yes the voice technology indeed .
"[10:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , defi yeah , yeah"
[10:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:58] Speaker_D | Easy to use ?
[11:00] Speaker_A | I don't see we could've made it any easier .
[11:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:08] Speaker_A | Totally .
[11:08] Speaker_B | Yeah definitely .
[11:09] Speaker_C | Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer
[11:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:15] Speaker_C | wants .
[11:16] Speaker_D | Uh is it complicated ?
[11:18] Speaker_A | No .
[11:18] Speaker_C | No .
[11:20] Speaker_D | Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? Uh functional ?
[11:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:23] Speaker_B | Yeah definitely .
[11:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:27] Speaker_D | Um .
"[11:33] Speaker_D | We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function ."
[11:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:36] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm ."
[11:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:38] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[11:41] Speaker_A | Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't .
"[11:43] Speaker_B | No , not at all ."
[11:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[11:46] Speaker_D | And uh , what else ? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well ."
[11:53] Speaker_B | Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .
[11:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:59] Speaker_A | So yeah , um um ."
[12:03] Speaker_D | Um will device appeal to all age groups ?
[12:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:07] Speaker_C | I think so .
"[12:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that ."
[12:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:24] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:24] Speaker_A | And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually
"[12:31] Speaker_B | I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah ."
[12:31] Speaker_D | Mm .
[12:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[12:43] Speaker_C | Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and
"[12:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:48] Speaker_C | not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons .
"[12:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ?"
[12:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[13:11] Speaker_B | Yep .
[13:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:15] Speaker_C | Under the cost .
[13:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Yep .
[13:27] Speaker_D | Um .
[13:28] Speaker_A | So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh
[13:30] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[13:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , ."
[13:57] Speaker_D | And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product .
[14:00] Speaker_B | Excellent .
"[14:00] Speaker_A | Okay , nick the cable back then . Ooh . Right do um"
[14:02] Speaker_C | I mixed up the colours a little bit .

[14:15] Speaker_A | Mm .

[14:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[14:33] Speaker_A | Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh"
"[14:38] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah , definitely ."
[14:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[14:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:10] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[15:16] Speaker_A | uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um"
[15:22] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[15:31] Speaker_A | Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath . So I call the meeting closed ."

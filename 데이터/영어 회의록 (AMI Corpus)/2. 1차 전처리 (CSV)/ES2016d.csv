[00:13] Speaker_A | Yep . Soon as I
[00:17] Speaker_A | get this .
[00:27] Speaker_A | Okay . This is our last meeting .
"[00:34] Speaker_A | Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget ."
"[01:01] Speaker_A | Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line ."
"[01:14] Speaker_A | Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles ."
"[01:35] Speaker_A | Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that ."
"[02:05] Speaker_A | Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . Then we looked at the components um"
"[02:35] Speaker_A | the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically"
"[02:49] Speaker_A | how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over ."
[02:58] Speaker_C | The prototype discussion .
[03:00] Speaker_A | The prototype yeah . Do you need a this ?
[03:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[03:05] Speaker_C | There is our remo the banana . Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic ."
"[03:29] Speaker_C | These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through ."
[03:44] Speaker_A | Very nice .
"[03:46] Speaker_C | And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam ."
"[04:08] Speaker_C | That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ?"
[04:24] Speaker_B | Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might
[04:41] Speaker_C | Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .
[04:42] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[04:49] Speaker_C | T the actual thing might be smaller . Yeah .
[04:51] Speaker_B | Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one one on either side or
[04:57] Speaker_A | What but what's that button ?
[04:58] Speaker_B | not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . That's um
[04:59] Speaker_C | Just the on and off .
"[05:00] Speaker_A | Uh , 'kay ."
[05:03] Speaker_B | yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .
[05:07] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[05:07] Speaker_B | Right ? Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . There you go .
[05:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:19] Speaker_B | Right .
[05:20] Speaker_D | Pretty impressive .
[05:22] Speaker_A | Well done .
[05:26] Speaker_D | Kind of a banana .
[05:28] Speaker_C | And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .
[05:36] Speaker_A | Well luckily we are going to find out .
[05:39] Speaker_A | Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .
[05:51] Speaker_D | Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .
[05:59] Speaker_D | Um .
[06:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
[06:21] Speaker_D | So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .
[06:37] Speaker_D | Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So
[06:53] Speaker_D | we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .
"[07:02] Speaker_D | And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that ."
[07:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[07:32] Speaker_A | I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . It's bright ."
[07:33] Speaker_D | Mm .
[07:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:38] Speaker_C | I would .
[07:42] Speaker_A | It still has your traditional black .
[07:44] Speaker_C | It's curved . It's not there's no sharp
[07:48] Speaker_C | angles to it .
"[07:48] Speaker_A | Yep , not angular ."
[07:50] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[07:51] Speaker_B | I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . However the colour , we don't have a say in that ."
[08:03] Speaker_C | Some people might say it . Yeah .
[08:05] Speaker_A | Mm .
[08:07] Speaker_D | That's true .
[08:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:27] Speaker_A | Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form .
[08:29] Speaker_B | Right .
[08:31] Speaker_B | Right . It's different . You don't want your uh
[08:35] Speaker_B | three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .
"[08:49] Speaker_D | This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? Does that sound good ?"
[08:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:57] Speaker_D | What do you think ? Three ? Four ?
[09:00] Speaker_A | I would say
[09:00] Speaker_D | Five ? Four is fair . Okay .
"[09:06] Speaker_A | Very non-committal , four ."
"[09:07] Speaker_D | Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?"
"[09:14] Speaker_B | It's very intuitive , I think yeah ."
"[09:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had ."
"[09:21] Speaker_D | One , 'kay ."
[09:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:25] Speaker_D | Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?"
"[09:32] Speaker_C | Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . Yeah ."
[09:37] Speaker_B | Right .
[09:37] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[09:43] Speaker_A | S scrolling through and selecting a few .
[09:45] Speaker_B | Right .
[09:48] Speaker_B | So that's a one .
[09:49] Speaker_A | I think that's a one .
[09:51] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:56] Speaker_D | Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .
[10:04] Speaker_B | Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .
[10:25] Speaker_B | Oops .
[10:29] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[10:36] Speaker_C | Yeah . Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?"
[10:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[10:41] Speaker_C | I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it ."
[10:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:48] Speaker_D | That's true .
[10:48] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[10:49] Speaker_A | But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think ."
[10:49] Speaker_D | Mm .
[10:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:55] Speaker_A | Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then
[11:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:02] Speaker_B | Mm .
[11:04] Speaker_A | I'd say two .
"[11:08] Speaker_A | With the speech recognition , which of course may"
[11:13] Speaker_A | be changed depending on budget .
[11:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:16] Speaker_B | Y you could add an extra feature actually .
[11:21] Speaker_B | Which makes this thing
[11:23] Speaker_B | raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .
[11:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:29] Speaker_B | We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .
[11:36] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[11:36] Speaker_C | Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . So it can't be that"
[11:37] Speaker_D | Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah .
"[11:42] Speaker_B | Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much ."
[11:43] Speaker_C | expensive .
[11:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:07] Speaker_B | Right . That'd be tough then . Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control ."
[12:20] Speaker_D | So . Are we adding one of these
[12:24] Speaker_D | two features ? gonna say okay .
[12:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:27] Speaker_D | So we're back to a one ? Or a two ? Two , 'kay ."
[12:30] Speaker_C | Two .
[12:30] Speaker_B | Two .
[12:30] Speaker_A | Two .
[12:33] Speaker_D | Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?
[12:44] Speaker_C | screens on .
[12:45] Speaker_B | It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right .
[12:46] Speaker_C | Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have .
[12:49] Speaker_D | But for remotes yeah .
"[12:49] Speaker_A | But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour ."
[12:57] Speaker_D | Two ? Three ?
[13:02] Speaker_B | Yeah not really .
[13:03] Speaker_D | But how many remotes do you see like this ? Not so many .
[13:06] Speaker_A | If we added the screaming factor then we go up . Um I would say we're probably at four .
[13:11] Speaker_B | Right .
[13:15] Speaker_D | Really ? Okay . That's gonna hurt us . Okay . Um spongy material ?
"[13:23] Speaker_B | Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of ."
"[13:24] Speaker_A | We have some spongy , yeah ."
"[13:25] Speaker_C | Yeah as much as as needed , I think ."
[13:31] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[13:32] Speaker_B | It's not a one though . One would be the whole thing
[13:33] Speaker_A | No .
"[13:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back ."
[13:36] Speaker_B | to fold and stuff .
[13:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:42] Speaker_B | So that's a four at most .
[13:44] Speaker_A | Probably a four at most .
[13:48] Speaker_A | Possibly even a five .
"[13:48] Speaker_D | And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?"
[13:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:55] Speaker_D | I'd say we did .
[14:05] Speaker_A | It's true .
[14:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:09] Speaker_C | Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely ."
[14:12] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[14:14] Speaker_D | Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen .
[14:26] Speaker_D | Seventeen divided by s
[14:30] Speaker_D | Eight .
[14:42] Speaker_C | Is that some long division ? No .
[14:45] Speaker_D | Well I haven't done math in years .
[14:45] Speaker_A | Something .
[14:48] Speaker_D | What two I dunno .
"[14:52] Speaker_C | Just , I'm sure there's a ."
[14:53] Speaker_D | Okay we'll say two point four two .
[14:56] Speaker_D | Right ?
[14:58] Speaker_D | How does that look ?
[15:02] Speaker_C | No I can't do long very impressive .
[15:10] Speaker_A | And what what is the acceptable criteria ?
[15:15] Speaker_A | Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?
[15:17] Speaker_D | Oh no . They just told me to
[15:26] Speaker_A | Alright then .
[15:30] Speaker_D | So that's that .
"[15:34] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , let's see ."
[15:39] Speaker_A | Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget .
[15:47] Speaker_A | But we do .
[15:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:51] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .
[15:57] Speaker_D | Oh my god . Okay .
[15:58] Speaker_C | Two point four two basically .
[16:00] Speaker_D | Yeah we'll go with that .
[16:03] Speaker_D | Not too shabby .
[16:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:08] Speaker_A | We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well .
[16:20] Speaker_B | It's too much .
[16:42] Speaker_A | Oh it won't let me do that .
[16:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:49] Speaker_A | Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements ."
[16:58] Speaker_B | Battery .
"[17:15] Speaker_A | Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery ."
[17:20] Speaker_A | Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? Probably
[17:24] Speaker_A | some e either two or four .
[17:26] Speaker_B | Two .
[17:28] Speaker_A | Two ?
"[17:32] Speaker_B | At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month ."
"[17:43] Speaker_A | This is consumerism . Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker ."
[17:57] Speaker_C | We're advanced chip are we ?
"[17:58] Speaker_B | That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah ."
"[18:00] Speaker_A | 'Kay , we have one of those ."
[18:10] Speaker_A | Probably it's double curved .
"[18:11] Speaker_B | Double curved , yes ."
[18:17] Speaker_A | Case materials are plastic .
[18:19] Speaker_B | Plastic .
"[18:22] Speaker_A | Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . Is that right or is it just one ?"
[18:26] Speaker_B | N no . No that's just one .
"[18:31] Speaker_B | It's just one mo single mould , we can do that ."
[18:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[18:34] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
"[18:36] Speaker_A | I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . Special colour ?"
"[18:39] Speaker_B | Exactly , right ."
[18:39] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[18:42] Speaker_B | That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special ."
[18:44] Speaker_D | Bright yellow .
[18:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:58] Speaker_A | So we actually have the L_C_D_ display
[19:04] Speaker_C | I'd say the integrated .
[19:05] Speaker_B | Yes unfortunately .
[19:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:08] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? Um special form ? Special material .
[19:11] Speaker_C | Mm .
[19:18] Speaker_B | We could of course make the buttons wood . Say mahogany or so
[19:26] Speaker_A | Or titanium . They cost us all the same .
[19:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm or titanium .
"[19:29] Speaker_A | Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements ."
[19:32] Speaker_C | No that's getting a bit
[19:34] Speaker_C | tiny .
[19:37] Speaker_C | Yeah . I'd ignore that .
[19:39] Speaker_D | Leave it blank .
[19:40] Speaker_A | Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five .
[19:51] Speaker_A | Which I believe is
[19:52] Speaker_B | Yeah that's too much .
[19:54] Speaker_A | by three Euros over .
[19:58] Speaker_B | It's hard to believe .
[20:07] Speaker_A | So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .
[20:09] Speaker_C | If it w
[20:12] Speaker_C | What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .
[20:29] Speaker_A | Well 'cause we have to have both right ?
[20:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[20:46] Speaker_C | Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself ."
[20:48] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[20:53] Speaker_B | Right .
[20:54] Speaker_A | So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?
[20:56] Speaker_C | Uh that is possible yeah .
[20:58] Speaker_B | Right . We may not need it .
[21:04] Speaker_B | There you go . Perfect .
[21:05] Speaker_A | Well there we go . Twelve point five .
[21:06] Speaker_C | There we go .
[21:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:15] Speaker_C | Screen . Make it a bigger dial . Easier to use . Even easier to use then .
[21:16] Speaker_A | screen here .
[21:22] Speaker_A | Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote .
[21:27] Speaker_A | Back to the design room boys .
[21:29] Speaker_B | So we can just
[21:32] Speaker_B | take away a heck of a lot of the there you go .
[21:43] Speaker_B | There you go . Oops .
[21:44] Speaker_C | There you go . Even simpler .
[21:47] Speaker_D | Looks more like a banana .
[21:49] Speaker_C | Yeah . For all those fruit lovers out there .
[21:50] Speaker_B | There you go . One more criteria .
[22:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:27] Speaker_A | Let's see here .
[22:43] Speaker_A | I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But
[22:49] Speaker_A | I'd like to hear your thoughts .
[23:01] Speaker_A | Uh h what did you think of our project process ?
[23:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:10] Speaker_A | Good .
"[23:11] Speaker_B | Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go ."
[23:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . Right from the start of the day .
[23:17] Speaker_C | We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .
[23:29] Speaker_A | But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .
[23:34] Speaker_A | Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I
[23:39] Speaker_A | think we tried a lotta different things and um
[23:43] Speaker_A | I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .
[23:53] Speaker_A | Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ?
[24:00] Speaker_A | Which was the whiteboard and the pens .
[24:00] Speaker_C | Yeah . We've used the whiteboard .
[24:02] Speaker_B | Super super .
"[24:03] Speaker_A | I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p"
[24:05] Speaker_D | Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
[24:15] Speaker_A | Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired .
"[24:15] Speaker_B | Heads are gonna roll , believe me ."
[24:18] Speaker_B | Yes yes .
[24:24] Speaker_D | Mm . Kinda .
[24:26] Speaker_A | Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for
[24:30] Speaker_C | Technology used .
[24:31] Speaker_A | technology .
[24:35] Speaker_A | Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated .
[24:42] Speaker_A | Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it .
[24:47] Speaker_C | Excellent .
[24:58] Speaker_A | Actually .
[25:02] Speaker_A | Um so there will probably be another
[25:06] Speaker_A | questionnaire coming up .
[25:09] Speaker_D | We might have a while though .
"[25:09] Speaker_A | And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . But that's the end of our meeting ."

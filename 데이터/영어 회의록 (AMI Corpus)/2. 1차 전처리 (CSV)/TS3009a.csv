"[02:01] Speaker_A | the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction ."
"[02:27] Speaker_A | We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design ."
[02:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[02:39] Speaker_A | Uh trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern ."

[03:00] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[03:06] Speaker_A | There happen to be uh three stages . functional , conceptual , and d detailed design ."
"[03:14] Speaker_A | Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase ."
[03:24] Speaker_A | That's just it .
[03:29] Speaker_A | We have uh these two Smartboards .
"[03:33] Speaker_A | Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything ."
"[03:52] Speaker_A | Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board ."
[04:10] Speaker_A | different uh functions on the board . You can see them there .
"[04:16] Speaker_A | So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . This is just a ."
[04:31] Speaker_A | Yes I will eraser so .
[04:36] Speaker_A | It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .

"[04:50] Speaker_A | and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . Just uh let them all uh stand here ."
"[04:56] Speaker_A | We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . Well it's just like a normal uh"
[05:19] Speaker_A | paint . So it's gone .
"[05:22] Speaker_A | Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself ."

[10:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
[10:20] Speaker_A | It's not like in paint . Line width . And you can choose a nice one . Width width . With each other .
[10:23] Speaker_C | Line width .

[10:28] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[10:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:41] Speaker_B | It's a pussy cat .
"[10:45] Speaker_C | Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well ."
[10:48] Speaker_A | Well then you change it .
[10:51] Speaker_A | And erase things .
[10:53] Speaker_C | Uh .
[11:01] Speaker_C | It smiles nicely .

"[11:14] Speaker_C | These are whiskers , you know ."
[11:16] Speaker_D | Right .
[11:17] Speaker_C | Uh well I think it's obvious right now .
[11:26] Speaker_D | No it looks great .
[11:31] Speaker_C | Miaow .
[11:40] Speaker_A | Yeah save it and start a new blank document .
[11:46] Speaker_C | Uh yeah uh blank .
[11:52] Speaker_C | Well I feel comfortable now . Thanks for this exercise .
[11:53] Speaker_D | Oh great .
[11:58] Speaker_C | I feel totally at ease .
[11:59] Speaker_A | Yeah that's it . We're one big happy family now . Well then uh the serious uh stuff .
[12:06] Speaker_C | Yeah something like that .
"[12:11] Speaker_A | We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros ."
"[12:22] Speaker_A | Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros ."
"[12:27] Speaker_A | So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research ."
[12:45] Speaker_D | Right .
[12:45] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[12:51] Speaker_A | Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market"
[13:07] Speaker_D | Right .
[13:17] Speaker_A | Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ?
[13:36] Speaker_D | I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .
[13:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:42] Speaker_D | Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player
[13:47] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
[13:54] Speaker_A | Yep .
[13:55] Speaker_A | That's alright .
"[13:59] Speaker_A | That would be a nice idea , yes ."
[14:00] Speaker_D | so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control .
[14:05] Speaker_A | Yep yep yep .
"[14:07] Speaker_D | Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ?"
"[14:20] Speaker_A | Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so ."
[14:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:21] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it .
[14:25] Speaker_C | No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
[14:27] Speaker_B | Easy to learn .
[14:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:33] Speaker_D | Yeah that's right .
"[14:34] Speaker_C | and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise ."
[14:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:34] Speaker_A | Yes .
[14:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:41] Speaker_A | I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Well yeah ?
[14:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[14:49] Speaker_B | I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think .
[14:49] Speaker_C | Alright .
[14:50] Speaker_D | Right .
[14:53] Speaker_A | No that's right .
[14:56] Speaker_A | Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international .
[14:58] Speaker_B | Precisely .
[15:02] Speaker_D | Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .
[15:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:08] Speaker_B | Yeah indeed .
[15:09] Speaker_A | Yes .
[15:13] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
"[15:13] Speaker_A | Yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou"
"[15:21] Speaker_B | Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?"
[15:23] Speaker_C | And stereo uh s uh audio installations .
[15:23] Speaker_A | Uh .
[15:24] Speaker_A | We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw .
[15:27] Speaker_D | Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that .
[15:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:33] Speaker_A | Yep .
[15:34] Speaker_B | And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind .
"[15:41] Speaker_C | Most people do , yeah ."
[15:43] Speaker_A | Well yeah .
"[15:45] Speaker_A | It doesn't have to be , but we can ."
[15:46] Speaker_B | W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it .
[15:52] Speaker_A | Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:59] Speaker_C | Well .
[16:05] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[16:06] Speaker_D | Yeah but it's it has to be useable .
[16:07] Speaker_C | It has to be different and familiar at the same time .
[16:09] Speaker_A | Yes .
[16:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[16:10] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things ."
[16:12] Speaker_A | Yep .
[16:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:30] Speaker_C | Oval ?
[16:32] Speaker_B | Yeah or so
[16:46] Speaker_D | Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .
[16:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:57] Speaker_B | Yeah alright .
[17:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:08] Speaker_C | Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful"
[17:13] Speaker_A | Yes .
[17:14] Speaker_C | or else uh they would have been ano another shape .
[17:14] Speaker_A | Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here .
[17:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:34] Speaker_D | It shouldn't be boxy .
[17:34] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah . You have to use one hand .
[17:38] Speaker_A | It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .
[17:42] Speaker_D | I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand .
[17:44] Speaker_C | Why not ?
[17:47] Speaker_B | Yeah it doesn't fit .
[17:48] Speaker_A | Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those .
[17:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:05] Speaker_C | W no w what else ? I di
[18:05] Speaker_D | No that's ol old fashioned .
[18:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:08] Speaker_C | Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ?
[18:09] Speaker_D | I can imagine that us
"[18:11] Speaker_B | Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end ."
[18:14] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[18:17] Speaker_D | It fits in your palms .
[18:20] Speaker_B | Mm .
[18:27] Speaker_D | Hmm ?
[18:29] Speaker_D | Um .
"[18:34] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box , yeah . It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean ."
[18:38] Speaker_B | Yeah yea
"[18:46] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah I understand , but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long"
[18:47] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[18:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:05] Speaker_C | Yeah yes I thought about something like that .
[19:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:11] Speaker_C | A big recognisable button on top or something .
"[19:13] Speaker_D | Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea"
[19:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:21] Speaker_C | The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together ."
[19:22] Speaker_D | Right .
[19:25] Speaker_A | Yes uh that's yep .
[19:27] Speaker_D | But it should be possible to to um make it
[19:32] Speaker_D | ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Yeah .
[19:36] Speaker_A | Yep .
[19:36] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[19:39] Speaker_C | Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah .
"[19:43] Speaker_D | Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours ."
"[19:46] Speaker_C | Colours , yeah ."
[19:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:55] Speaker_A | Ha .
[19:55] Speaker_D | That's kinda trendy .
[20:01] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[20:02] Speaker_A | Sound nice . Yes .
[20:09] Speaker_A | Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Yes ?
[20:15] Speaker_D | Right .
[20:23] Speaker_A | Yes .
[20:29] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[20:32] Speaker_A | This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .
[20:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:43] Speaker_A | Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say .
"[20:49] Speaker_C | Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh ."
[20:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[20:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:00] Speaker_D | Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .
[21:02] Speaker_C | No n n
[21:02] Speaker_A | Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose .
"[21:14] Speaker_B | Yeah that's bad , yeah ."
[21:14] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah .
[21:18] Speaker_B | Yeah that's important .
[21:20] Speaker_C | Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other .
[21:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:34] Speaker_D | Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah .
[21:34] Speaker_C | I think so . It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think .
[21:35] Speaker_A | It's not that in China it's different ?
[21:37] Speaker_D | Yep .
[21:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:45] Speaker_C | It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .
[21:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:16] Speaker_A | Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . Yeah .
[22:26] Speaker_A | Yes .
[22:27] Speaker_D | To make it more trendy .
[22:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:32] Speaker_D | Right .
[22:33] Speaker_B | Yes . Yes .
[22:34] Speaker_D | Right .
[22:38] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[22:39] Speaker_B | Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy ."
[22:43] Speaker_A | Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .
[22:50] Speaker_C | Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .
[22:50] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[22:51] Speaker_B | Yeah alright .
[22:53] Speaker_B | Yeah normal .

[23:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:04] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah .

[23:34] Speaker_D | Yeah or a t Teletubby front . Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .
[23:41] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[23:43] Speaker_A | Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the"
"[23:54] Speaker_A | uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think ."
"[24:00] Speaker_C | Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah ."
[24:01] Speaker_A | Or something like that .
[24:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .

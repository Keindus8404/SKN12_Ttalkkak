[00:00] Speaker_D | It's Play-Doh .
[00:07] Speaker_D | Because kids yeah .
"[00:08] Speaker_C | I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . ."
[00:08] Speaker_B | I used to eat it .
[00:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[00:13] Speaker_D | But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah ."
[00:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[00:21] Speaker_C | Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough ."
[00:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[00:33] Speaker_D | Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah ."
[00:44] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[00:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[00:48] Speaker_B | Yep .
[00:51] Speaker_C | We've got some .
[00:54] Speaker_B | We've got a cool prototype .
"[00:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So ,"
"[00:59] Speaker_C | everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here ."
[01:08] Speaker_B | Double curved .
[01:09] Speaker_A | Nice .
[01:27] Speaker_D | That is cool .
"[01:29] Speaker_C | So , basically ,"
"[01:32] Speaker_C | if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button ."
[01:36] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[01:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[01:39] Speaker_C | Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down ."
[01:48] Speaker_D | What's the big blue thing ?
"[01:50] Speaker_C | That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit"
[01:51] Speaker_D | Oh cool .
[01:57] Speaker_D | And mute .
"[01:59] Speaker_C | Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different ."
[02:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
[02:15] Speaker_A | That certainly does .
[02:25] Speaker_A | Mm .
[02:26] Speaker_B | Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ .
"[02:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . It should be . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know"
[02:29] Speaker_A | Mm .
[02:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[02:38] Speaker_A | 'S great .
[02:41] Speaker_D | Oh it's so cute .
"[02:48] Speaker_A | I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one ."
"[02:58] Speaker_B | Oh right , yeah ."
"[02:58] Speaker_C | Ah , that's good thinking , yeah ."
"[03:01] Speaker_A | But , that's I don't see why that's not possible ."
"[03:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes ."
"[03:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , but then"
"[03:17] Speaker_D | but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?"
[03:25] Speaker_A | Yes s
"[03:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse ."
[03:34] Speaker_A | Mm . Sure . Sure .
[03:40] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[03:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:48] Speaker_B | Imagine d are you right handed ?
[03:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:04] Speaker_D | Have them in stock .
[04:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:06] Speaker_D | Make 'em more appealing as well .
"[04:08] Speaker_A | But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea ."
[04:15] Speaker_C | Do you think it says R_R_ ?
"[04:19] Speaker_A | I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable ."
[04:23] Speaker_C | Fashion to electronics . Yeah .
[04:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
"[04:31] Speaker_C | Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh ."
"[04:43] Speaker_A | Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . Well done ."
[04:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? Okay ."
[05:01] Speaker_A | I need that cable . Thank you . Yeah . Um .
"[05:07] Speaker_A | One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs ."
"[05:14] Speaker_C | The costs , was that what you said ?"
[05:18] Speaker_D | Mm .
[05:26] Speaker_C | But it's edible .
[05:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[05:30] Speaker_B | Chew proof .
"[05:31] Speaker_D | Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , ."
"[05:33] Speaker_C | That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof ."
[05:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[05:39] Speaker_A | Uh right . Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power ."
[05:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:47] Speaker_B | Oh ho-ho .
[05:55] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[06:04] Speaker_A | thing that's inside it . Ooh . So the case , we've gone for the double curved ."
[06:17] Speaker_A | and it's made out of rubber .
"[06:27] Speaker_A | And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? So special colours ."
[06:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:37] Speaker_A | Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff ."
[06:41] Speaker_D | And special material .
[06:43] Speaker_A | Yep . Yeah . Um .
[06:50] Speaker_B | Rubber .
[06:57] Speaker_C | The buttons are rubber .
"[06:57] Speaker_D | Well they're rubber , aren't they ?"
"[06:58] Speaker_A | Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So ,"
[06:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:08] Speaker_D | We're under budget .
[07:16] Speaker_C | That's cool .
[07:19] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[07:21] Speaker_C | And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected .
"[07:24] Speaker_A | this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh ."
"[07:41] Speaker_D | It's already saved , I think ."
[08:00] Speaker_A | Splendid . Okay .
"[08:07] Speaker_A | So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do ,"
[08:13] Speaker_D | Thank you .
[08:18] Speaker_D | Mm .
[08:19] Speaker_A | your evaluation .
"[08:21] Speaker_D | Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . Oh ."
[08:33] Speaker_A | F_ eight .
[08:36] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[09:31] Speaker_D | And this is false , this is just like"
"[09:34] Speaker_D | to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ?"
[09:43] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:56] Speaker_C | Mm .
[09:57] Speaker_A | I would give it a seven .
[09:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:00] Speaker_D | As in it's not .
"[10:01] Speaker_A | Oh sorry , one , d yeah ."
[10:02] Speaker_B | A one .
"[10:18] Speaker_B | Well , the kinetic thing , yeah ."
[10:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[10:21] Speaker_C | That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new ."
[10:25] Speaker_D | So it's .
"[10:30] Speaker_C | It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah ."
[10:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . True .
[10:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:37] Speaker_D | I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . Three .
"[10:38] Speaker_C | It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno ."
[10:38] Speaker_B | Two .
[10:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:42] Speaker_C | Maybe three , yeah ."
"[10:47] Speaker_D | So criteria three is is it easy to use ? I think it's a one , I think ."
[10:50] Speaker_A | Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .
[10:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:57] Speaker_C | Mm .
[11:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
[11:04] Speaker_D | But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?
[11:05] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[11:09] Speaker_C | If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two ."
[11:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:15] Speaker_A | Give it a t give it a two .
"[11:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay . 'Kay , criteria four is costs . 's great ."
[11:21] Speaker_A | Cost . It's come in under budget . So that's a definite one .
[11:24] Speaker_C | Yeah . That was great .
[11:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:31] Speaker_A | Amount of buttons .
[11:34] Speaker_A | Contains only the necessary buttons . Yeah .
[11:36] Speaker_D | So it's a one ?
[11:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:38] Speaker_D | Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? Yes . Very good . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ?"
[11:44] Speaker_A | So it's anti-R_S_I_ .
[11:51] Speaker_B | It's yellow .
[11:52] Speaker_A | I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
[11:54] Speaker_D | No ? But it is smallish .
[11:57] Speaker_B | Two .
"[11:57] Speaker_C | It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know ."
[12:03] Speaker_C | Maybe it will . Uh .
"[12:06] Speaker_D | Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost ."
"[12:11] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah . I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely ."
[12:12] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:15] Speaker_A | No , I mean"
[12:17] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[12:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess ."
[12:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:25] Speaker_C | But , yeah , it can get lost ."
[12:26] Speaker_D | The mobiles get lost all the time .
"[12:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine ."
"[12:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:32] Speaker_B | Mm . Mm .
[12:34] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . So , that's that ."
[12:41] Speaker_D | Yay .
[12:42] Speaker_A | Alright it's all all systems go .
[12:42] Speaker_D | It's like like a number one . Um .
[12:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:48] Speaker_D | Number one product .
[12:50] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:50] Speaker_D | All done , thanks ."
[12:52] Speaker_D | We fitted all the criterias . Yeah .
"[13:02] Speaker_A | Well done , Reissa ."
[13:04] Speaker_D | So that's that one .
[13:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[13:44] Speaker_C | Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and"
[13:57] Speaker_B | Well .
[14:05] Speaker_B | It is .
"[14:05] Speaker_C | Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , ."
"[14:11] Speaker_A | I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design ."
"[14:21] Speaker_D | In four diff in in four meetings . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick ."
[14:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:37] Speaker_D | They're using our ideas .
"[14:55] Speaker_C | So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ?"
[14:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:06] Speaker_B | Oh really ?
[15:10] Speaker_D | Just start summarising now .
[15:17] Speaker_A | I haven't got message .
"[15:19] Speaker_D | See summary , there . If you just reply to that one ."
[15:40] Speaker_D | Was it was it fifty or five ?
"[15:43] Speaker_C | I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?"
"[15:51] Speaker_A | It gets handed over to another department . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . Um ."
[15:51] Speaker_D | Depends how much we sell .
[15:53] Speaker_C | Uh .
[15:58] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[16:15] Speaker_C | But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing .
"[16:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um"
[16:43] Speaker_A | something that uh that isn't out there already .
[16:56] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:02] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:03] Speaker_D | Definitely .
"[17:17] Speaker_A | Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new ."
[17:32] Speaker_C | Mm .
[17:33] Speaker_C | Mm .
[17:39] Speaker_C | Mm .
[17:40] Speaker_C | It make watching T_V_ healthy .
"[17:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . It's fine , it's kid proof ."
[17:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:48] Speaker_D | Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .
[17:49] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[17:52] Speaker_A | Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody ."
[17:54] Speaker_D | No .
[18:01] Speaker_B | Mm yep .
[18:04] Speaker_D | Yay .
"[18:04] Speaker_C | Right , you too ."
[18:05] Speaker_A | Um . Drinks are on the company .
[18:08] Speaker_B | Cool .
[18:09] Speaker_A | In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . Yeah .
[18:17] Speaker_B | Glad to hear that .
"[18:24] Speaker_A | That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um ."
[18:25] Speaker_C | That's it .
[18:29] Speaker_D | Yep .
[18:32] Speaker_D | We haven't got the five minute left thing yet .
[18:37] Speaker_D | Mm mm .
[18:42] Speaker_C | I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
[18:47] Speaker_C | silence .
[18:51] Speaker_C | Should we call the day then ?
"[18:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire ."
"[18:58] Speaker_C | Uh , right ."
[18:59] Speaker_A | Um .
[19:01] Speaker_A | It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .
[19:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:10] Speaker_D | In project .
[19:10] Speaker_A | But I'm not the authority to say that it is .
[19:17] Speaker_A | Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
[19:28] Speaker_D | I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool .
[19:44] Speaker_C | Your moment to shine .
"[19:53] Speaker_A | I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . something that t the whiteboard"
[20:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:03] Speaker_A | thingy , that's great ."
"[20:08] Speaker_A | Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text ."
[20:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:29] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[20:30] Speaker_C | Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step ."
[20:32] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Mm .
[20:35] Speaker_D | Logitech .
"[20:37] Speaker_C | I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic ."
[20:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:42] Speaker_D | Meeting adjourned .
[20:44] Speaker_C | Right .
[20:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .

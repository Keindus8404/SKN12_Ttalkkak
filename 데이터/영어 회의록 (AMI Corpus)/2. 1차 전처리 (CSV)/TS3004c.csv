[00:45] Speaker_B | It's It won't wake up .
[00:45] Speaker_D | Bonjour .
"[00:56] Speaker_B | What ? No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them ."
[00:56] Speaker_D | Why ?
[01:01] Speaker_D | Okay .
[01:03] Speaker_B | Come on .
[01:04] Speaker_D | Check check check check .
[01:04] Speaker_A | Hello . Oop .
[01:06] Speaker_B | Why won't it wake up ?
[01:18] Speaker_B | Is it on ?
[01:27] Speaker_D | The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .
[01:32] Speaker_B | But how ?
"[01:34] Speaker_B | Ah , there it is ."
[01:35] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
[01:38] Speaker_B | Uh .
[01:39] Speaker_C | I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . Yeah .
"[01:46] Speaker_A | Okay , we're just going to the later ."
[01:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[01:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , I received an email as well ."
[01:53] Speaker_A | So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .
[02:10] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[02:11] Speaker_B | Which one was mine ?
[02:13] Speaker_A | So that's me . Uh okay . So Uh okay .
"[02:21] Speaker_A | Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . What's it called , I dunno . Whatever ."
[02:35] Speaker_B | The minutes .
"[02:55] Speaker_B | No , just tell us ."
[02:55] Speaker_C | Mm no .
"[03:09] Speaker_A | It has to be very basic , not too many buttons ."
[03:13] Speaker_A | Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .
[03:21] Speaker_A | And it has to be easy to learn .
"[03:24] Speaker_A | That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?"
[03:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:38] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[03:38] Speaker_A | Okay . So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh"
[03:46] Speaker_D | Shall I start ?
[03:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:56] Speaker_D | No .
[04:04] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[04:14] Speaker_D | I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in"
"[04:28] Speaker_D | uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls ."
[04:50] Speaker_D | Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
[04:55] Speaker_D | Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
"[05:10] Speaker_D | Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition ."
[05:26] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[05:26] Speaker_D | But um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative ."
"[05:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , more ."
[05:42] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[05:43] Speaker_B | Well , I'll I'll get back on it ."
[05:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:52] Speaker_D | Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
[06:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[06:10] Speaker_D | So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends ."
"[06:23] Speaker_D | This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Spongy ."
[06:34] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[06:42] Speaker_B | Spongy .
[06:45] Speaker_C | Spongy .
"[06:45] Speaker_B | Spongy , like sponge ."
"[06:49] Speaker_C | So rubber , kind of ."
[06:50] Speaker_B | Uh soft materials .
[06:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:52] Speaker_A | But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be flexible ."
"[06:58] Speaker_B | Yeah , but Yeah ."
"[06:59] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah ."
[07:07] Speaker_C | It's like a sponge .
"[07:08] Speaker_B | Soft , sponge ."
[07:10] Speaker_D | So it's also a stress-ball .
"[07:12] Speaker_A | That's a good That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ?"
"[07:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , but Yeah . How are you gonna make it ?"
[07:21] Speaker_A | R_ soft .
"[07:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation ."
[07:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[07:28] Speaker_D | Okay ?
"[07:30] Speaker_D | What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts ."
[07:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:40] Speaker_D | Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . And uh some basic uh colour fronts .
[08:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:12] Speaker_D | Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget ."
"[08:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'll get back on that ."
[08:27] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[08:31] Speaker_D | Intro Yeah .
"[08:34] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem ."
"[08:34] Speaker_B | Well , I got f also an email from"
[08:39] Speaker_B | the the technology department .
[08:40] Speaker_D | Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
[08:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:52] Speaker_D | Okay . Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .
[08:52] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[08:53] Speaker_B | I'll check what they exact mean .
"[08:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement ."
"[09:02] Speaker_B | Yeah , th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well ."
[09:16] Speaker_B | Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
"[09:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's that's something I dunno ."
"[09:23] Speaker_D | Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be ."
"[09:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , so uh we gotta de"
[09:38] Speaker_B | We have to decide on that .
[09:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:43] Speaker_D | That was this ?
[10:01] Speaker_C | They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So it's m the most expensive .
"[10:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip ."
[10:17] Speaker_B | Okay . And speech recognition ?
[10:21] Speaker_B | Advanced . Yeah .
[10:27] Speaker_B | I'll I'll give you my design .
"[10:28] Speaker_C | Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display ."
[10:47] Speaker_B | I had uh
[10:50] Speaker_B | to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
[10:59] Speaker_B | I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . More modern . Y yes .
"[11:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic ."
"[11:14] Speaker_B | Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this ."
[11:37] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[11:38] Speaker_B | It's the most important part , I think . But And the home base is something like that , something simple ."
"[11:46] Speaker_B | Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons ."
"[11:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe the teletext tel"
"[11:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well ."
"[12:02] Speaker_D | No , I don't uh I don't like it ."
[12:02] Speaker_A | No .
[12:06] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[12:18] Speaker_C | But it That's on on the display .
[12:20] Speaker_B | No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up
[12:27] Speaker_B | much more than that part . So the focus is on these two parts .
[12:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:33] Speaker_B | So you don't see all the buttons you else need .
[12:35] Speaker_A | But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . So you can't use your thumb for it .
[12:51] Speaker_B | Here uh Well we have volume .
[12:54] Speaker_C | I think it is on uh on the bottom too .
"[12:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , down there ."
[12:56] Speaker_A | But it's not not the best best .
[12:57] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls .
"[13:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay . Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too ."
"[13:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . Yeah , why not ."
[13:05] Speaker_B | For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .
[13:06] Speaker_C | Scroll .
[13:10] Speaker_B | By just putting the volume on the side . And and just channel buttons here .
[13:13] Speaker_A | And the channels as well .
[13:15] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
"[13:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control ."
[13:28] Speaker_B | Basically it's it's here .
"[13:31] Speaker_C | Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom ."
"[13:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's better ."
[13:36] Speaker_B | They're on top ?
"[13:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom ."
[13:43] Speaker_C | Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .
[13:44] Speaker_B | You mean uh these to the low ?
[13:45] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[13:48] Speaker_A | Except from the on-off button .
"[13:51] Speaker_B | Oh okay . Well , yeah ."
"[13:52] Speaker_C | But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three ."
[14:02] Speaker_C | So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
[14:09] Speaker_C | Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .
"[14:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be"
[14:18] Speaker_B | should be easy to .
"[14:21] Speaker_B | I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top ."
"[14:25] Speaker_B | And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there ."
[14:39] Speaker_C | Yeah okay .
"[14:42] Speaker_B | But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use ."
[14:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:48] Speaker_B | So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half ."
[14:50] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[14:56] Speaker_C | No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . But uh we we can switch those two , yeah ."
[15:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[15:12] Speaker_B | Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open ."
"[15:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , that's cool ."
[15:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:37] Speaker_B | So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think ."
[15:45] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:46] Speaker_C | No .
[15:48] Speaker_B | So that's something we have to decide on .
"[15:50] Speaker_C | Yeah , we have to keep it simple ."
[15:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[15:52] Speaker_A | We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look ."
[15:55] Speaker_B | What we're gonna do . Okay .
"[16:17] Speaker_C | Okay , the component design ."
"[16:22] Speaker_C | I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge ."
"[16:29] Speaker_C | So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So"
"[16:43] Speaker_C | flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not Nothing square-like ."
[16:54] Speaker_B | Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved square .
[16:59] Speaker_D | Square . Like .
"[17:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing ."
[17:07] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .
[17:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:11] Speaker_C | And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .
"[17:16] Speaker_C | I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of"
[17:24] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[17:24] Speaker_A | Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . So the colours also . So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow ."
"[17:24] Speaker_C | looking , I think ."
[17:29] Speaker_C | Okay .
[17:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:37] Speaker_A | Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
"[17:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , mm n"
"[17:40] Speaker_C | Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public ."
[17:53] Speaker_A | We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
"[17:54] Speaker_C | No , okay . That's a that's a sen"
"[18:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
"[18:01] Speaker_C | We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think ."
[18:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's cool . Yep . And still trans"
[18:14] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[18:15] Speaker_A | Still still transparent .
[18:16] Speaker_C | Okay .
[18:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . But with all with logo on it .
[18:19] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[18:21] Speaker_C | Well this is a remote control , a very old one ."
"[18:34] Speaker_A | Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure ."
"[18:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno ."
[18:40] Speaker_C | Maybe .
"[18:43] Speaker_C | But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ? S"
"[18:47] Speaker_B | Well one of the options . You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . So you can just replace them I think ."
[18:52] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[18:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , we could do that ."
"[18:57] Speaker_B | That was the idea , or just uh release one ."
"[19:02] Speaker_B | Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones ."
"[19:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . So you can still th look through it ."
[19:09] Speaker_A | Yeah . Cool .
[19:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[19:11] Speaker_C | Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .
"[19:17] Speaker_A | Yeah . It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic . That's better prob Yeah ."
[19:22] Speaker_C | With the hard hard buttons .
[19:23] Speaker_B | I think uh rubber really has an odd look .
"[19:26] Speaker_D | Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself ."
[19:26] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's it's all on one level ."
"[19:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , on one level ."
[19:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , I know what you mean ."
[19:59] Speaker_C | So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's Yeah .
[20:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[20:07] Speaker_C | Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?"
"[20:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's cool ."
[20:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:15] Speaker_A | But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh
[20:20] Speaker_B | Oops .
"[20:23] Speaker_A | basic remote control from normal plastic , and"
[20:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:26] Speaker_A | the rounds of it from softer s
[20:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
[20:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:31] Speaker_A | I dunno .
[20:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:45] Speaker_A | Cool .
[20:50] Speaker_B | Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah .
"[20:50] Speaker_A | Yeah . Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah , that's right ."
[20:53] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[20:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So Or no"
[20:59] Speaker_A | They can choose .
"[21:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out a bit ."
"[21:09] Speaker_B | Different , I think , also ."
[21:11] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
[21:24] Speaker_A | Is it Okay .
"[21:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , it can . 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well ."
"[21:28] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
"[21:31] Speaker_A | Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just No , just some LED ."
[21:33] Speaker_B | I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . And I can change the colour of it .
"[21:37] Speaker_A | Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something ."
"[21:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it I th I don't think so ."
[21:46] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[21:47] Speaker_C | Then uh some more technical things .
"[21:51] Speaker_C | I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things ."
[22:13] Speaker_B | I'm sure we can fit in .
[22:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:23] Speaker_D | Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah . No ."
"[22:27] Speaker_C | Nah , but they just said we need it . Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in ."
[22:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[22:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , a recharger maybe ."
[22:40] Speaker_B | Yes . Yes .
"[22:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu ."
[22:46] Speaker_A | A recha Oh no . Uh Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .
[22:47] Speaker_B | Re recharger . Base station .
"[22:47] Speaker_C | Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries ."
"[22:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best ."
"[22:51] Speaker_C | Okay . Not a separate Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one ."
"[22:54] Speaker_A | No , just rechargeable batteries ."
[23:00] Speaker_C | Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .
[23:12] Speaker_D | Ah cool .
[23:15] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[23:16] Speaker_B | So if you hold it , it gets powered ."
[23:16] Speaker_A | But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
[23:16] Speaker_C | If you hold it .
"[23:23] Speaker_A | It's dark in the room . No . It's just batteries , that's cheaper ."
"[23:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth ."
[23:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:41] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[23:43] Speaker_C | So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons ."
[23:54] Speaker_B | Mm . So we need uh two D_ .
[23:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think ."
[23:58] Speaker_A | Definitely .
[23:59] Speaker_C | Um these kinda materials can be used .
"[24:03] Speaker_A | But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic ."
[24:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think so too ."
"[24:08] Speaker_A | The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume ."
[24:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . But I think just the volume is enough ."
[24:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[24:25] Speaker_C | And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ ."
[24:33] Speaker_A | I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .
"[24:37] Speaker_C | Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels ."
"[24:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[24:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[24:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , that was it I guess . Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or We haven't decided yet ."
[24:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
[24:58] Speaker_D | Uh but we have to do something about the trend . The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .
"[24:59] Speaker_C | L Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?"
"[25:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers ."
[25:16] Speaker_D | Uh yeah i Just Just on front .
"[25:17] Speaker_B | So you can the the spongy yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control ."
[25:21] Speaker_A | No .
[25:22] Speaker_D | Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .
[25:25] Speaker_B | I just can't imagine it .
[25:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think . Titanium . It's mentioned here uh ."
"[25:33] Speaker_C | Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive ."
[25:35] Speaker_A | But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit
"[25:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth ."
[25:41] Speaker_A | more rounded . Yeah .
[25:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right ."
[25:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:00] Speaker_A | We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger . We already know that . Just a normal battery . Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .
[26:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . We have batteries .
[26:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:16] Speaker_B | Regular .
"[26:17] Speaker_A | Okay , the case is just a plastic one ."
"[26:18] Speaker_C | Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second ."
"[26:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular ."
[26:24] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:27] Speaker_C | I think I'll just check it .
[26:34] Speaker_B | Yes .
[26:35] Speaker_A | That's pretty much it .
[26:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:39] Speaker_B | User interface concept .
[26:39] Speaker_A | And a flashy light .
[26:53] Speaker_B | I dunno either .
[26:55] Speaker_C | Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
[26:56] Speaker_B | Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .
[27:01] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's for the next one . That's for th
[27:02] Speaker_C | So we should did it here ?
[27:03] Speaker_B | So we're staying here ?
[27:05] Speaker_C | Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
[27:05] Speaker_A | Uh that I think that's the next next meeting .
[27:07] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[27:12] Speaker_B | Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?"
[27:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones ."
[27:26] Speaker_A | Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .
"[27:27] Speaker_B | Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those ."
[27:40] Speaker_A | What the fuck is it ?
[27:53] Speaker_C | What ?
[27:54] Speaker_A | It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay . Just .
[27:56] Speaker_C | Oh .
[27:58] Speaker_C | Okay .
[28:00] Speaker_A | Maybe you can make it like this .
"[28:06] Speaker_A | And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it ."
[28:18] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[28:20] Speaker_A | Maybe , I dunno ."
[28:21] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[28:23] Speaker_A | Okay , so we have this at the moment ."
[28:26] Speaker_C | I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .
"[28:31] Speaker_B | Yeah , you Yeah ."
"[28:32] Speaker_A | Okay , so we'd have this . Is that okay ?"
"[28:34] Speaker_C | Yeah . I think it's probably better . Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger ."
"[28:35] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's a little problem , of course , as well ."
[28:47] Speaker_B | That's not scrollable too easy .
[28:50] Speaker_A | Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ?
[28:54] Speaker_C | I think in middle .
[28:56] Speaker_B | Uh wh what is the middle part ?
[28:58] Speaker_A | That's the numbers .
"[29:00] Speaker_C | Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle ."
"[29:00] Speaker_B | Numbers , okay ."
"[29:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , I agree as well ."
[29:06] Speaker_B | Use the dz
"[29:06] Speaker_A | It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there ."
"[29:18] Speaker_A | Next to each other . back and forth . So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well ."
"[29:19] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's right ."
[29:26] Speaker_C | Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .
"[29:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[29:36] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[29:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , of course uh ."
[29:47] Speaker_A | Why ?
"[30:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference ."
"[30:05] Speaker_C | But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing ."
"[30:06] Speaker_B | It's it's obvious , I think ."
"[30:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's not not It's not al uh always the same . Every remote control's uh different ."
[30:14] Speaker_A | But it's exactly th
"[30:14] Speaker_C | In uh On most on most remote controls . So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time ."
[30:29] Speaker_C | I dunno .
[30:31] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[30:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it ."
"[30:37] Speaker_A | Okay , so hmm ."
[30:40] Speaker_A | What did What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .
[30:44] Speaker_B | Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?
"[30:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh"
[30:59] Speaker_D | uh square uh remote control . 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .
[31:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:08] Speaker_A | And the LED .
"[31:08] Speaker_B | No , you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . You have to look at that image of the iPod ."
[31:17] Speaker_D | Yes . Okay .
[31:18] Speaker_B | More that uh kind of style .
[31:22] Speaker_A | Uh Yeah .
[31:26] Speaker_B | Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .
"[31:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right ."
"[31:41] Speaker_A | Yeah , five . Let's give five ."
"[31:46] Speaker_D | And um uh uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project ."
[31:53] Speaker_B | Yeah . Um I think Yeah .
"[31:56] Speaker_B | That's your choice , I think huh ."
"[31:58] Speaker_A | So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? So you could put it like that , okay ."
[32:03] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[32:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , so top down . Hmm ?"
"[32:07] Speaker_D | Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station ."
[32:11] Speaker_C | Do we have to design that w as well ?
[32:13] Speaker_A | Uh I'm not sure .
[32:14] Speaker_C | The docking station ?
"[32:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think so ."
[32:18] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[32:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , we can b"
"[32:21] Speaker_B | But th Yeah , that can be very simple ."
[32:24] Speaker_B | Least .
"[32:24] Speaker_D | It c it could be just just a square , just a packet ."
"[32:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , just a recharger ."
"[32:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , just where you're around something ."
"[32:32] Speaker_B | Li Yeah , we had one example ."
[32:35] Speaker_C | But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
[32:43] Speaker_B | Mm . Mm .
"[32:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then ."
[32:46] Speaker_B | Which w
[32:50] Speaker_B | Here you see one that's very round .
"[32:54] Speaker_C | Oh yeah , okay ."
[32:55] Speaker_B | So I think that can be all kind of shapes .
[32:58] Speaker_A | But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .
[33:02] Speaker_A | That's all . Yeah .
[33:02] Speaker_C | Of the remote control ?
[33:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:05] Speaker_C | Yeah Yeah .
[33:06] Speaker_A | Just round it up .
[33:12] Speaker_A | No . Yeah . Yeah .
[33:12] Speaker_B | More rounded .
"[33:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's This is also rounded . I think i"
"[33:21] Speaker_A | No , just just the corners ."
[33:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[33:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes ."
[33:33] Speaker_A | Shapes .
"[33:35] Speaker_B | Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new ."
[33:35] Speaker_C | Not in depth .
"[33:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , but Yeah , if if we want to make it"
"[33:43] Speaker_C | kind of , yeah , new ."
[33:46] Speaker_B | I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .
"[33:57] Speaker_A | It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?"
[34:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:02] Speaker_D | What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . Okay .
"[34:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving ."
[34:29] Speaker_D | Uh it's very annoying . Okay .
[34:32] Speaker_C | I dunno .
[34:34] Speaker_C | I dunno if it's handy .
[34:43] Speaker_C | This ? The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .
[34:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:47] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here
[35:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[35:04] Speaker_B | Curves , curves ."
[35:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:07] Speaker_B | You've more there as well .
"[35:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[35:12] Speaker_B | It wasn't very small one .
[35:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:19] Speaker_B | That is for elderly .
"[35:20] Speaker_A | So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have ."
"[35:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know ."
[35:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[35:32] Speaker_B | I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours ."
[35:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:44] Speaker_B | And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .
[35:44] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[36:00] Speaker_A | And you have the scroll button inside . Okay . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well .
[36:02] Speaker_B | Yes . Just a simple scrollb
[36:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:08] Speaker_B | Doesn't have to be .
"[36:10] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , it's cool ."
[36:19] Speaker_A | Rubber spongy .
[36:20] Speaker_D | spongy and fruity . But yeah .
[36:23] Speaker_C | Spongeball kinda .
"[36:28] Speaker_A | Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square ."
[36:35] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[36:36] Speaker_C | Okay . Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff ."
[36:37] Speaker_D | It The th th
[36:42] Speaker_A | No .
[36:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[36:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public ."
"[37:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , they're all the same ."
[37:13] Speaker_A | But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .
[37:27] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[37:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , we could do that ."
[37:32] Speaker_B | Could .
"[37:32] Speaker_D | Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow ."
[37:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[37:37] Speaker_B | No , I think Oh ."
[37:39] Speaker_A | It's right .
"[37:40] Speaker_B | Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . So it will just be a small"
[37:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:51] Speaker_B | small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .
[37:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly .
[38:09] Speaker_A | So maybe you have to ask her .
[38:09] Speaker_D | No .
"[38:09] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint ."
[38:15] Speaker_B | I'll be able to do a better job .
"[38:16] Speaker_D | If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here ."
[38:20] Speaker_D | Doesn't work .
"[38:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , I'll see it ."
[38:29] Speaker_A | Yeah . Is that okay ?
"[38:29] Speaker_B | Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod ."
[38:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[38:31] Speaker_A | Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition ."
[38:40] Speaker_A | Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a
[38:44] Speaker_A | advanced chip .
[38:57] Speaker_D | No .
[38:58] Speaker_B | Uh strange that I received the information about that .
[39:02] Speaker_D | Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said .
"[39:13] Speaker_A | Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , okay ?"
[39:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[39:20] Speaker_A | The function of that in there . Yeah .
[39:21] Speaker_B | Okay .
[39:22] Speaker_A | And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .
[39:23] Speaker_C | Fine .
"[39:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , we probably do ."
"[39:27] Speaker_A | But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ?"
[39:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[39:29] Speaker_C | No .
[39:30] Speaker_D | But we don't have any f information about the cost .
[39:33] Speaker_B | No .
[39:34] Speaker_D | We started with information about the cost was now th
"[39:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip ."
[39:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[39:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question ."
"[40:00] Speaker_B | Doesn't say . Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample ."
"[40:10] Speaker_B | So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning ."
[40:17] Speaker_D | No . Does it say does it say something back ?
"[40:18] Speaker_B | Yeah uh th that's just It's a No . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it ."
[40:25] Speaker_C | But i it's a separate chip .
"[40:28] Speaker_B | I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well ."
[40:32] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[40:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know anything about this , but Nah ."
"[40:38] Speaker_A | Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult ."
[40:42] Speaker_B | Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .
[40:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[40:45] Speaker_A | Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . We have to stop now . Okay , just We have to stop it now ."
"[40:46] Speaker_B | Okay . No no worries about the cost , etcetera . And there's a chip in it that will Okay ."
[40:52] Speaker_D | Fine .

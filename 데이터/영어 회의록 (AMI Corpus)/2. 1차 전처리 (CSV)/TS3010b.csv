[01:47] Speaker_A | Okay . So welcome back . What do do we have to do ?
"[02:00] Speaker_A | So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your in the map in the"
[02:13] Speaker_A | From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there .
"[02:25] Speaker_A | I wanna hear from you , what you've done ."
[03:08] Speaker_C | Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ?
[03:20] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[03:25] Speaker_C | I've save it on my computer , my presentation ."
[03:31] Speaker_C | But where ?
[03:33] Speaker_A | What's the name ?
[03:41] Speaker_A | What's the name of it ?
[03:45] Speaker_C | It was about the working of the remote control .
[03:51] Speaker_A | It's the technical function or the functional requirements .
[03:55] Speaker_C | Nope .
[04:09] Speaker_C | Wait .
[04:13] Speaker_C | The working design . But I've saved it .
[04:15] Speaker_A | Working design .
[04:20] Speaker_C | But now I don't know where it is .
[04:31] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[04:32] Speaker_A | Working design . What is this ? Product documents .
[04:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:43] Speaker_A | On the desktop .
[04:51] Speaker_A | Up .
[04:55] Speaker_C | One more .
[04:55] Speaker_A | Up . Up .
[04:59] Speaker_A | Up . Yes . My Documents .
[05:06] Speaker_A | Nope .
[05:07] Speaker_C | What the fuck is this ?
"[05:08] Speaker_A | Gone . Well you Um Nah . Nah , nah , nah ."
[05:19] Speaker_A | PowerPoint . Working design .
[05:21] Speaker_C | Yeah that's the empty one .
[05:28] Speaker_C | I had one .
[05:31] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[05:31] Speaker_A | of working design .
[05:34] Speaker_C | Open it .
[05:36] Speaker_C | Okay here it is .
[05:38] Speaker_A | Save as .
[05:45] Speaker_D | Desktop .
[05:48] Speaker_C | Project .
[05:48] Speaker_A | Project .
[05:49] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay . Well .
[05:50] Speaker_A | Save .
[05:51] Speaker_C | Okay .
[05:52] Speaker_A | Very good .
[05:54] Speaker_C | A little later but here it is .
[05:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:15] Speaker_C | So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it .
[06:27] Speaker_A | Now have ten minutes to tell it .
"[06:29] Speaker_C | Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it uh of it ."
[06:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:42] Speaker_C | Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it ."
"[06:57] Speaker_C | First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , um because its uh not so expensive ."
"[07:17] Speaker_C | And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it ."
"[07:42] Speaker_C | Now And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery ."
"[08:01] Speaker_C | And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television ."
"[08:23] Speaker_C | That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all"
[08:34] Speaker_C | My preferences ? It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big .
"[08:41] Speaker_C | Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it ."
[08:59] Speaker_C | We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's I think it's easier .
[09:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[09:14] Speaker_C | And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it ."
[09:37] Speaker_C | This is uh just uh Yeah . Yeah .
[09:37] Speaker_A | Oh oh . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?
"[09:45] Speaker_C | If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two ."
"[09:50] Speaker_A | Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer ."
"[10:03] Speaker_A | Okay so it's the size of the remote control . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it ."
[10:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:18] Speaker_C | But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ?
[10:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:32] Speaker_A | I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
"[10:36] Speaker_C | Then this is an option . Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the"
[10:49] Speaker_A | Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though . We have to choose one .
[10:56] Speaker_A | It has to work on o uh all televisions .
[10:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
[10:59] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions .
[11:08] Speaker_C | And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .
[11:12] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[11:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:16] Speaker_C | And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers ."
"[11:32] Speaker_C | So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . And also different things ."
[11:38] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[11:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . Good idea .
[11:44] Speaker_C | Yes .
[11:44] Speaker_D | Will this will this add to the cost ?
[11:47] Speaker_C | Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .
[11:54] Speaker_D | Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?
"[12:00] Speaker_C | I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much ."
[12:03] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:04] Speaker_D | Not much . 'Kay .
[12:05] Speaker_C | Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Just one .
[12:08] Speaker_A | Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .
"[12:13] Speaker_C | Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it ."
[12:23] Speaker_A | Yeah but are their
[12:25] Speaker_A | profits bigger than their cost ?
"[12:28] Speaker_C | Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think ."
[12:34] Speaker_A | Yeah but there are also design cost .
"[12:39] Speaker_A | I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?"
[12:45] Speaker_A | Would you change the cover ?
[12:48] Speaker_A | No .
[13:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:02] Speaker_C | Okay .
[13:15] Speaker_C | Okay .
[13:19] Speaker_A | Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .
[13:23] Speaker_C | Okay . You're the Project Manager . Yes . That's it .
[13:23] Speaker_B | No .
[13:23] Speaker_D | Mm .
[13:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:27] Speaker_A | That's clear . Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .
[13:33] Speaker_B | Oh . That's me .
[13:48] Speaker_B | Come on . .
[13:53] Speaker_B | Ah .
[13:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:57] Speaker_B | Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set .
"[14:15] Speaker_B | Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting ."
[14:31] Speaker_B | Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television .
"[14:41] Speaker_B | And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that ."
"[15:04] Speaker_B | We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more ."
"[15:16] Speaker_B | Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ ."
[15:36] Speaker_B | Basic or multifunctional ?
[15:39] Speaker_A | We'll got back on that later .
[15:41] Speaker_B | Okay yeah . Yeah well the that was just on my mind . So uh I didn't know what uh
[15:42] Speaker_D | Yes .
[15:47] Speaker_B | what way we would go .
[15:51] Speaker_B | Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk .
[15:56] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[15:57] Speaker_A | 'Kay , thank you ."
"[16:01] Speaker_A | Then it's your turn , the marketing expert ."
[16:03] Speaker_D | Okay .
[16:05] Speaker_D | Uh um m
[16:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[16:41] Speaker_D | So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls ."
[17:06] Speaker_D | Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not .
"[17:17] Speaker_D | Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls ."
[17:27] Speaker_D | Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy .
[17:42] Speaker_D | And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings .
[17:54] Speaker_D | Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection .
"[18:06] Speaker_D | And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important ."
"[18:20] Speaker_D | Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings ."
[18:33] Speaker_D | Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups .
"[18:49] Speaker_D | Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it ."
"[19:11] Speaker_D | But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it ."
"[19:25] Speaker_D | Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it ."
"[19:43] Speaker_D | Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here ."
[20:10] Speaker_D | And um they are more critical on their money spending .
"[20:16] Speaker_D | Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent ."
[20:39] Speaker_D | So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
"[20:54] Speaker_D | Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use ,"
"[21:13] Speaker_D | remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested ."
"[21:24] Speaker_D | And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition ."
[21:36] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:51] Speaker_D | You can find most functions on a T_V_ set .
"[21:56] Speaker_D | So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness ."
"[22:03] Speaker_D | And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one ."
"[22:18] Speaker_D | But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that ."
[22:33] Speaker_D | That were my findings .
[22:35] Speaker_A | Okay thank you . Yes .
[22:52] Speaker_D | Yes .
[22:52] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[22:57] Speaker_B | No .
[22:57] Speaker_D | No .
[23:05] Speaker_C | No . No .
"[23:07] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's hard to uh"
[23:11] Speaker_B | get the younger
[23:13] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[23:14] Speaker_B | group .
[23:14] Speaker_A | I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .
[23:18] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:23] Speaker_B | Just the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm .
[23:24] Speaker_A | Yes . Only the L_C_D_ .
[23:29] Speaker_A | So But we'll come back on that .
[23:32] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[23:51] Speaker_A | Uh we go back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So"
[24:07] Speaker_A | not necessary . Next .
[24:12] Speaker_A | Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . Third .
"[24:25] Speaker_A | We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff ."
[24:45] Speaker_A | Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .
[24:54] Speaker_A | Next .
[24:56] Speaker_A | Um no .
"[25:05] Speaker_A | We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So like"
"[25:15] Speaker_A | you said , we need the . Maybe it's good to put it in a document ."
[25:29] Speaker_A | Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .
[25:36] Speaker_D | Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .
[25:42] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
"[25:43] Speaker_D | The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news ."
[25:45] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[25:48] Speaker_A | Yes , it's okay ."
"[26:01] Speaker_A | Yeah but we don't use it . It's a new requirement . So , it's not my requirement ."
"[26:11] Speaker_C | 'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay ."
[26:13] Speaker_A | We have to do this .
[26:15] Speaker_C | No discussion about it . Okay . Unfortunately .
[26:16] Speaker_A | No .
[26:22] Speaker_A | what controls do we need ?
[26:28] Speaker_A | Who first ?
[26:30] Speaker_B | Well a power button ?
[26:32] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:35] Speaker_A | Uh power .
[26:48] Speaker_A | Uh mm channel .
[26:53] Speaker_B | But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .
[26:59] Speaker_A | Zero to nine .
[27:02] Speaker_B | Uh volume .
[27:04] Speaker_A | Volume .
[27:11] Speaker_A | Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ?
[27:18] Speaker_D | Mine ? It's the functional requirements .
[27:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
[27:31] Speaker_A | We had w uh no no no no .
[27:39] Speaker_B | Oh mine .
[27:44] Speaker_B | Technical .
[27:52] Speaker_A | Hallo .
[27:56] Speaker_A | Okay . What do we need ?
[28:00] Speaker_A | On-off . Zero to nine .
"[28:04] Speaker_C | To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down ."
[28:09] Speaker_A | Yeah that's the channel .
[28:10] Speaker_D | D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?
[28:14] Speaker_A | Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .
[28:33] Speaker_A | only one or
[28:35] Speaker_A | two numbers .
[28:38] Speaker_B | Mm yes .
[28:42] Speaker_A | Hello ?
[28:45] Speaker_A | That's ch
"[28:56] Speaker_D | I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options ."
[29:03] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[29:18] Speaker_A | On the L_C_D_ screen ,"
[29:21] Speaker_A | you mean ?
[29:22] Speaker_D | Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .
"[29:29] Speaker_A | Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions ."
[29:38] Speaker_D | Yes .
[29:40] Speaker_C | But then we come to the costs .
[29:42] Speaker_A | N Yes . But if we
[29:49] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[29:51] Speaker_D | But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um"
[30:05] Speaker_D | remote control .
"[30:07] Speaker_D | And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell ."
[30:26] Speaker_A | So now we don't have a lot of buttons .
[30:33] Speaker_A | Is this enough ?
[30:36] Speaker_B | Mute .
[30:37] Speaker_A | Mute .
[30:40] Speaker_A | Maybe in the menu ?
[30:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
[30:47] Speaker_B | Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh
[30:53] Speaker_A | Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .
[30:53] Speaker_B | thing to do .
[30:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:58] Speaker_A | Maybe more ?
[31:08] Speaker_A | Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons .
[31:36] Speaker_A | Yes .
[31:44] Speaker_C | Okay .
[31:55] Speaker_A | Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .
[31:58] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:02] Speaker_A | That's for the So uh next point .
[32:08] Speaker_A | Now we have lunch-break .
[32:10] Speaker_A | After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No .
"[32:26] Speaker_A | Your individual action , you can find them in the email ."
[32:33] Speaker_A | So now it's time for lunch .
[32:34] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:35] Speaker_D | Okay . Good idea .
[32:36] Speaker_A | Thanks for coming .

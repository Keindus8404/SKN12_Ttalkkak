"[00:04] Speaker_C | Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting ."
"[00:10] Speaker_C | And again I'll take minutes . The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently ."
[00:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[00:27] Speaker_C | Um then
[00:27] Speaker_B | It does look very cool .
[01:08] Speaker_B | And then do we get to make a remote control ?
"[01:17] Speaker_C | it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four"
[01:25] Speaker_C | fifteen .
"[01:27] Speaker_A | Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Yeah ."
[01:28] Speaker_C | Is that right ?
"[01:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah ."
[01:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[01:41] Speaker_C | Yes .
[01:41] Speaker_A | Presentation .
"[02:13] Speaker_C | Dual use , perfect . Dual use , perfect . Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? Sorry , sorry ."
[02:30] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[02:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[02:44] Speaker_C | Wow .
"[02:53] Speaker_A | well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah ."
[02:56] Speaker_D | Uh yeah .
[02:59] Speaker_D | Rubber .
"[03:00] Speaker_B | Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?"
"[03:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , ."
"[03:04] Speaker_D | Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah ."
[03:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:19] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[03:20] Speaker_B | It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable ."
[03:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[03:29] Speaker_D | Yeah . And it's spongy as well . So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here ."
[03:29] Speaker_A | Mm . Hmm .
[03:36] Speaker_C | Huh .
[03:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[03:59] Speaker_D | Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next ."
[04:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:16] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[04:21] Speaker_B | So where's the volume ?
[04:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:23] Speaker_D | The volume is is scrolling . On the side , this one . Yeah you just do it like this . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here ."
[04:25] Speaker_A | It's on the side .
"[04:25] Speaker_B | Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm ."
"[04:35] Speaker_B | Oh okay , ."
[04:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[04:37] Speaker_D | See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button ."
[04:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:47] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[04:54] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[04:55] Speaker_B | Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button ."
[04:59] Speaker_D | A mute button .
[05:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:01] Speaker_D | Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display ."
"[05:06] Speaker_B | On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute ."
"[05:10] Speaker_A | Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options ."
"[05:13] Speaker_D | Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?"
"[05:18] Speaker_C | But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?"
"[05:18] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?"
[05:19] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[05:21] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah , okay ."
"[05:22] Speaker_B | Okay , cool . So that that solves the whole mute issue ."
[05:24] Speaker_A | Mm .
[05:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .
"[05:37] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , very good ."
[05:40] Speaker_C | And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
[05:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website ."
[05:46] Speaker_A | Cool .
[05:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[05:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:52] Speaker_D | In the actual one .
[05:54] Speaker_D | Yeah . So if you have questions .
"[06:06] Speaker_C | Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess ."
"[06:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . But yeah , uh that's cool , cool ."
"[06:20] Speaker_C | Very good . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow ."
[06:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[06:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , see the budget ."
[06:42] Speaker_C | We'll just send all of our manufacturing to
[06:46] Speaker_C | some nice poor country and
[06:49] Speaker_C | cut some of the prices that way .
[07:18] Speaker_C | Marketing Expert .
[07:26] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[07:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[08:02] Speaker_C | So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?
"[08:06] Speaker_B | Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good ."
"[08:11] Speaker_C | Mm dots , never mind ."
"[08:38] Speaker_D | Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot ."
"[08:41] Speaker_B | Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?"
[08:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?
"[08:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , just prepare one now ."
"[08:50] Speaker_D | It will be red , too ."
"[09:07] Speaker_B | Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at ."
[09:13] Speaker_B | That's this one . What do you all say ?
[09:17] Speaker_A | So ?
[09:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:20] Speaker_C | Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah ."
"[09:21] Speaker_B | Oh we're all so proud of the . Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in ."
"[09:35] Speaker_C | Ah , okay ."
[09:35] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[09:37] Speaker_C | Excellent . Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine ."
"[09:40] Speaker_B | Yeah . But that's alright . If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?"
[09:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:51] Speaker_D | I would think yes , yeah ."
[09:51] Speaker_C | I think it does .
"[09:51] Speaker_A | Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger ."
"[10:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one ."
[10:03] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[10:12] Speaker_C | But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family ."
[10:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:13] Speaker_A | But then yeah .
"[10:17] Speaker_A | Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable ."
[10:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:18] Speaker_B | I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen .
[10:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[10:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue ."
[10:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:33] Speaker_A | Right .
[10:35] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[10:38] Speaker_B | Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? What do you what do you all think ?"
[10:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[10:44] Speaker_A | Yep .
[10:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:48] Speaker_A | Mm .
[10:54] Speaker_C | Six .
[10:54] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[10:55] Speaker_D | Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . Yeah ."
[11:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:06] Speaker_A | One more thing is that i
[11:10] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:15] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[11:15] Speaker_D | No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy ."
[11:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:21] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[11:25] Speaker_A | Oops .
[11:26] Speaker_B | I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
"[11:29] Speaker_D | Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah ."
"[11:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah ."
[11:30] Speaker_C | The length is gonna be difficu
"[11:35] Speaker_B | But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?"
[11:38] Speaker_C | Mm .
[11:39] Speaker_D | S uh slightly smaller .
[11:41] Speaker_B | So you have to keep that side flat .
"[11:44] Speaker_D | Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that ."
[11:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:49] Speaker_B | So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work ."
[11:53] Speaker_A | Right .
"[11:55] Speaker_B | Okay . Um okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? To make it beep . Or a buzzer ."
[11:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:05] Speaker_C | No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot ."
"[12:06] Speaker_A | No , we have a locator ."
[12:08] Speaker_D | Mm that you stick on T_V_ .
[12:10] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:15] Speaker_D | Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah ."
[12:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:19] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:21] Speaker_B | So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? Fabulous . D_ ."
[12:24] Speaker_D | Yep .
[12:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:39] Speaker_C | I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to ."
[12:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:51] Speaker_A | Intuitive .
"[12:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , and I mean d"
"[12:54] Speaker_A | And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it ."
[13:04] Speaker_C | But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .
[13:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:10] Speaker_B | So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yep ."
[13:10] Speaker_A | So l
[13:12] Speaker_C | Five ?
[13:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:25] Speaker_B | I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive"
"[13:40] Speaker_B | Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? Um okay , cool , E_ , okay ."
"[13:48] Speaker_B | Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed ."
[14:00] Speaker_B | Investigate .
[14:02] Speaker_C | Yep . But otherwise it's superb .
"[14:05] Speaker_B | So , should we give it a six ? Six ?"
[14:07] Speaker_C | Six .
"[14:09] Speaker_D | Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? See ."
[14:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:23] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting ."
[14:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic ."
"[14:29] Speaker_B | I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest ."
[14:33] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[14:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:36] Speaker_A | And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway ."
[14:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[14:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's varied ."
[14:42] Speaker_C | Yeah . Six ?
"[14:42] Speaker_B | Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . Okay , F_ ."
[14:48] Speaker_C | Voice control have seven .
"[14:54] Speaker_C | Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide ."
"[15:00] Speaker_B | Oh okay , cool . Um right , so ."
[15:05] Speaker_A | So it has voice control .
"[15:06] Speaker_B | Yes , so that's a seven then . Um , cool ."
[15:08] Speaker_A | Yep .
[15:09] Speaker_C | G_ technologically innovative .
[15:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:20] Speaker_D | Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new ."
[15:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:27] Speaker_C | All of the components have been used in other things before . But do yeah , yeah ."
"[15:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote ."
[15:30] Speaker_B | They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .
[15:30] Speaker_D | But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .
"[15:36] Speaker_C | Yeah . What do you reckon , five , six ?"
"[15:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , what do you all think ? Six ?"
[15:41] Speaker_D | Six .
"[15:42] Speaker_D | I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? It still has to do what i what it has to do ."
"[15:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? So , I don't think many peop"
[15:55] Speaker_C | Space remote .
"[15:57] Speaker_B | That's it , they can take it with them ."
[15:59] Speaker_C | Put fashion in electronics .
"[16:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? Yeah , sure ."
"[16:05] Speaker_D | It's the maximum fashion . Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so ."
[16:13] Speaker_B | There we go .
[16:15] Speaker_A | I think that's a .
[16:17] Speaker_C | Very good .
[16:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:21] Speaker_D | The average is about six and something . A little bit over six .
[16:27] Speaker_C | Or a seven .
"[16:28] Speaker_D | No , wait , a little bit under six . No , wait ."
"[16:28] Speaker_B | So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen ."
[16:34] Speaker_A | And one five .
"[16:36] Speaker_D | Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah ."
[16:42] Speaker_C | Six point point about six point five . Close enough .
"[16:43] Speaker_D | Six point something , yeah ."
[16:47] Speaker_B | Seven eight .
"[16:49] Speaker_B | Okay , that's pretty good , I think ."
[16:51] Speaker_C | Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .
"[16:58] Speaker_C | That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?"
"[17:02] Speaker_B | Um no , that's it , yeah ."
"[17:03] Speaker_C | That's it ? Alright . So , finance ."
[17:08] Speaker_C | And we'll see if we can
[17:15] Speaker_C | unscrew this first .
"[17:21] Speaker_B | Cool , there we go ."
[17:32] Speaker_B | There we go and there are the marks .
[17:36] Speaker_C | Beautiful . Not anymore .
[17:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:52] Speaker_C | Computer no signal ?
[18:01] Speaker_A | Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .
[18:15] Speaker_C | Adjusting .
[18:19] Speaker_C | There we go .
"[18:24] Speaker_C | Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria ."
[18:29] Speaker_C | And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
[18:41] Speaker_C | Can you read that ? Almost .
"[18:46] Speaker_C | More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? One simple battery . No kinetic energy , no solar ."
[18:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:58] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[19:05] Speaker_C | The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker ."
"[19:07] Speaker_A | Advanced , yeah ."
[19:12] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[19:13] Speaker_C | Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it ."
"[19:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , yes ."
[19:19] Speaker_C | Case material we said rubber . I don't know what special colour means .
[19:21] Speaker_D | Rubber .
[19:21] Speaker_A | Yep .
[19:25] Speaker_A | Mm anything uh I think which is not more .
"[19:28] Speaker_D | I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?"
[19:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know ."
"[19:34] Speaker_C | Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different ."
[19:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:39] Speaker_D | Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , yeah yeah , okay ."
[19:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:44] Speaker_B | Yeah , you might end up having to take off the"
"[19:46] Speaker_C | We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've"
"[19:48] Speaker_D | We have pushbuttons ,"
[19:49] Speaker_B | sample sensor .
[19:49] Speaker_A | Mm .
[19:51] Speaker_D | scro we have scroll wheel as well .
"[19:53] Speaker_C | Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S for the muting ."
"[19:56] Speaker_D | S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . And we have L_C_ display and yeah ."
[19:56] Speaker_A | No uh we we have uh yeah .
[19:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:01] Speaker_C | And button supplements .
[20:06] Speaker_A | Mm no .
[20:09] Speaker_B | No .
[20:09] Speaker_A | We don't have we're not using any of that .
[20:09] Speaker_C | No .
[20:10] Speaker_C | No ?
[20:14] Speaker_C | But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?
[20:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:22] Speaker_D | Okay , let's yeah ."
"[20:22] Speaker_B | We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ?"
[20:25] Speaker_C | I think the pushbutton oh .
"[20:30] Speaker_B | That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget ."
[20:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:36] Speaker_C | That seems unlikely .
[20:39] Speaker_C | Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense .
[20:39] Speaker_A | Huh ? Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .
[20:41] Speaker_B | Twelve point five .
"[20:44] Speaker_D | We have to count all of them , or yeah ."
"[20:46] Speaker_A | Mm I don't think so , no . No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have ."
[20:51] Speaker_C | No .
[20:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:00] Speaker_B | And L_C_ display .
[21:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:07] Speaker_C | So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here ."
[21:11] Speaker_B | This sample sensor .
[21:12] Speaker_C | Our budget's twelve point five .
[21:15] Speaker_A | Uh okay .
"[21:15] Speaker_B | Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there ."
"[21:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , so that has implications though for the ."
"[21:24] Speaker_A | Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello ."
[21:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:30] Speaker_C | For the locator .
"[21:32] Speaker_B | But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? We can afford to get rid of it ."
[21:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:34] Speaker_A | Mm and the locator also goes away .
[21:37] Speaker_D | But it was very no innovative innovativeness . Well um yeah .
[21:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:40] Speaker_B | So that means no locator , does it ?"
[21:46] Speaker_C | What else does it need ?
"[21:47] Speaker_D | Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps ."
"[21:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing ."
[21:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:01] Speaker_A | A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um yeah ."
[22:12] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
"[22:12] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
"[22:18] Speaker_C | Right , so we need one fifty off ."
[22:26] Speaker_C | Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
"[22:30] Speaker_A | So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button ."
"[22:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget ."
"[22:40] Speaker_D | Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing ."
[22:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:47] Speaker_B | But that's well you would just have to to spin it down .
[22:49] Speaker_C | You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .
[22:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[22:54] Speaker_B | So that's point three .
[22:54] Speaker_A | No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
[23:01] Speaker_D | But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .
[23:12] Speaker_C | That's with the L_C_
[23:13] Speaker_A | That comes with the L_C_D_ ?
[23:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:15] Speaker_C | We decided , 'cause it's not on our list ."
[23:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:17] Speaker_D | Mm .
[23:19] Speaker_C | The scroll wheel is on the side .
[23:29] Speaker_B | S so we're point three over .
[23:31] Speaker_C | We're point three over at the moment .
[23:34] Speaker_C | It's nothing n
[23:35] Speaker_B | Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
[23:40] Speaker_B | Could b still put them on the side .
"[23:47] Speaker_A | Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . On the side . Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah ."
[23:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:51] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[23:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:53] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah ."
[23:54] Speaker_C | Rather than having three different things that people have to do .
[23:58] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[23:59] Speaker_C | There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses ."
"[24:15] Speaker_C | So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah . Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?"
[24:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:35] Speaker_B | No . No , I don't think so ."
"[24:36] Speaker_A | Not really , no . Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Um yeah ."
[24:41] Speaker_C | Mm .
[24:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:44] Speaker_B | We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think ."
[24:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:52] Speaker_C | Yeah . Alright then .
[24:57] Speaker_B | Really ?
[24:58] Speaker_C | We're gonna have a beep .
"[25:00] Speaker_A | So instead of speaker , ."
[25:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:08] Speaker_B | Cool .
[25:18] Speaker_B | Oh the the beeper thing .
[25:21] Speaker_D | But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .
[25:25] Speaker_C | 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .
"[25:28] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate ."
[25:40] Speaker_C | okay .
[25:44] Speaker_C | looks like we've designed a
"[25:48] Speaker_C | banana . Well done , team . Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product ."
[26:11] Speaker_B | Cool .
[26:12] Speaker_C | Feedback ? Ideas ?
"[26:14] Speaker_D | Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had ."
[26:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[26:33] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[26:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[26:38] Speaker_B | If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can ."
[26:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[26:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[26:43] Speaker_A | Yeah . So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .
[26:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:52] Speaker_C | But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of ."
"[26:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , mm ."
"[27:00] Speaker_B | I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . Um yeah , so yeah ."
[27:02] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[27:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used ."
"[27:32] Speaker_B | Uh I like the pens . I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s"
"[27:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . They great ?"
"[27:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
[27:44] Speaker_C | Do you think they'd notice if one went ?
[27:50] Speaker_C | Oh okay .
"[27:51] Speaker_C | Yep . Shh . Yep . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep ."
"[28:05] Speaker_B | It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? Yeah ."
[28:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:12] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[28:12] Speaker_B | The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah ."
[28:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[28:17] Speaker_C | Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah ."
"[28:22] Speaker_D | But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah ."
"[28:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . back it , this is just had to be changed . And yeah , so cool ."
[28:28] Speaker_C | Mm .
[28:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:40] Speaker_B | Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?
[28:42] Speaker_C | And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well .
"[28:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah ."
[28:46] Speaker_C | I have no stake in it .
"[28:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , definitely . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good ."
[28:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:54] Speaker_C | You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . I'll leave the room and you can have another go ."
[28:56] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[29:01] Speaker_D | And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah ."
[29:04] Speaker_C | I think it worked quite well . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to
[29:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:11] Speaker_C | say their bit ?
[29:11] Speaker_D | To express them mm mm no .
"[29:12] Speaker_A | Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah ."
[29:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[29:40] Speaker_B | I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it ."
"[29:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so ."
[29:48] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[29:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:48] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[29:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:51] Speaker_B | I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control ."
[29:55] Speaker_D | Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .
"[29:58] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[29:59] Speaker_D | Patent patent patent . Mm .
[30:00] Speaker_C | Banana remote .
[30:04] Speaker_C | Yeah . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . Flip . Vibrate . And uh yeah .
[30:05] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[30:28] Speaker_B | Yes .
[30:37] Speaker_C | Um we've evaluated
[30:39] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[30:40] Speaker_C | the project . You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything"
[30:41] Speaker_B | And it's fabulous .
[30:44] Speaker_B | It's in the project documents .
[30:59] Speaker_C | that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?
[31:01] Speaker_D | And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Otherwise it's it's all fine .
[31:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed ."
[31:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[31:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[31:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:25] Speaker_C | Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our
"[31:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , we've got like five minutes left ."
"[31:29] Speaker_C | time . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time ."
[31:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:42] Speaker_D | Yes .
[31:43] Speaker_C | So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
"[31:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you ."
[31:48] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[31:54] Speaker_B | We could draw animals on the board again .
"[32:00] Speaker_D | You can make some animals . Oh , you don't like anim"
"[32:02] Speaker_B | I don't like Play-Doh , no . It's just minging . It smells so bad ."
[32:09] Speaker_B | It does .
[32:13] Speaker_B | Mm .
[32:19] Speaker_A | Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
"[32:22] Speaker_B | No , it hasn't been ."
[32:24] Speaker_B | Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
"[32:27] Speaker_C | I don't see why you can't stay here , really ."
[32:33] Speaker_C | Did I save this one ? Production costs .

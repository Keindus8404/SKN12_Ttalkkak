[00:08] Speaker_B | And something to fidget with .
[00:20] Speaker_A | Right .
"[00:22] Speaker_B | On your marks , get set , go ."
[00:23] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[00:24] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[00:26] Speaker_B | Such a long time since I've done these .
"[00:27] Speaker_D | Did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation , did you have had stages of clarification or I suppose you did , right ? Mm-hmm ."
"[00:34] Speaker_C | We did , yeah ."
[00:35] Speaker_B | At the beginning we did . Um
[00:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[00:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , we did two of those , didn't we ?"
[00:43] Speaker_C | I think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through .
[00:46] Speaker_A | Yeah . Mm .
[00:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[00:49] Speaker_B | And supposedly decided on things . And then we did th all the rest of them separately .
[00:51] Speaker_C | Yes .
[00:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[01:08] Speaker_C | I'd say no , but I d I mean I thought we had basically the same ideas to b I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that s yeah ."
"[01:17] Speaker_B | No , that's true . Mm-hmm ."
[01:20] Speaker_B | It's the length of it really .
[01:23] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[01:24] Speaker_C | And what counted as wha as for the spectral features it was more confusing what counted as a spectral feature , and we had a long discussion about that . But I don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging , just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do ."
"[01:28] Speaker_B | That's really hard , yeah ."
[01:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[01:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[01:34] Speaker_B | No .
[01:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[01:40] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[01:41] Speaker_B | And we we had a manual , which we haven't got here . Do you reckon if we get a copy , would that be useful ?"
"[01:46] Speaker_C | It probably would be , but I don't i it's been a long time , yeah , since we've done this ."
[01:47] Speaker_A | Mm .
[01:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:48] Speaker_B | Are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started ?
[01:52] Speaker_B | Can we get Ben to print us out one ?
"[01:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , that would be handy . Sign off ."
[01:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[02:02] Speaker_C | We did send it to him , yeah ."
"[02:02] Speaker_A | He has had it certainly . Yeah . Yeah , he's been emailed it while ago ."
"[02:03] Speaker_B | Yes , he's he's been e emailed it , yeah . Otherwise we can go onto our system and get it ."
[02:04] Speaker_D | Yeah ? O okay .
[02:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:13] Speaker_B | Yes . Let's say something rude .
[02:17] Speaker_A | Oh really ?
[02:19] Speaker_A | Excellent .
[02:19] Speaker_B | I oh . top .
"[02:25] Speaker_B | But no , how little work we did ."
"[02:25] Speaker_C | No , we don't at all ."
[02:31] Speaker_B | Yeah . They have got a
"[02:36] Speaker_B | conference thing , haven't they ?"
[02:38] Speaker_B | In the A_T_C_ .
"[02:39] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right , although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days , I think ."
"[02:43] Speaker_B | I had to fly to Germany to do a teleconference , the same as you did for the interview . And they fly you to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with three people in Chile . And had they asked , we could have done it fine at A_T_C_ and saved me having to to go to Germany for a day . But"
"[02:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , I did as well ."
[02:48] Speaker_A | Gosh .
"[02:56] Speaker_A | Right , aye ."
[02:56] Speaker_C | No .
[02:58] Speaker_A | Right . Gosh .
[03:00] Speaker_B | they haven't got that far .
"[03:07] Speaker_A | And you miss all the the body language and things . Yeah , yeah ."
[03:13] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:24] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:27] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:39] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:46] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:48] Speaker_A | Oh . Right . Gosh .
[03:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:50] Speaker_C | And you can't say looking over here . Like o
"[03:52] Speaker_B | Yes , if you see towards the top left of the image , you'll notice And luckily Olivia had warned me it might be complicated , and so I had something with without very many um n not little flying in and things , because that would just make it really difficult . But I practised the talk , yeah , standing up in front of it and pointing to things , and you're sitting down in front of And you could see yourself , but not only could s you see yourself , you see yourself bounce back two seconds later ."
[03:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[03:59] Speaker_A | That's very artificial though , isn't it ? Yeah . Not very sensible . Yeah , right ."
[04:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:18] Speaker_A | That must be really weird . Is there ? Gosh .
"[04:18] Speaker_B | By the time the signal had gone to Chile and back . So you're like oh , did I just do that ? And then you reacting to what you did a while ago . It was a really daft situation ."
[04:18] Speaker_C | Yeah . It is really strange .
[04:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . Gosh . Well Mm-hmm .
[04:26] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[04:28] Speaker_D | Okay , right , it's printing it out as well ."
[04:30] Speaker_B | Lovely .
[04:30] Speaker_A | Great .
[04:30] Speaker_C | Excellent .
"[04:36] Speaker_B | Yes , let's ."
[04:39] Speaker_B | Continuum flux or continuum .
[04:49] Speaker_C | Mm .
[04:51] Speaker_B | Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature . I think it should probably just be continuum .
"[05:03] Speaker_B | If it was continuum luminosity , you probably wouldn't it . Ooh ."
"[05:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'm happy enough with that . I don't feel strongly about it ."
"[05:20] Speaker_B | Okay , it's my part ."
"[05:23] Speaker_D | I actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking , who's top and who's bottom . I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know . I don't know ."
[05:23] Speaker_B | Oh .
[05:40] Speaker_B | 'Cause I would fight for line being a spectral feature as well .
[05:42] Speaker_C | Right .
"[05:44] Speaker_C | Right . Yeah , I think that's probably right as well ."
[05:46] Speaker_B | It's a bit hard to mark on this . Let's do that .
"[05:50] Speaker_C | Okay , next ."
"[05:53] Speaker_D | So so you sorry , um just for the convention , you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one . Okay , fair enough ."
[05:57] Speaker_B | The ones we want .
"[05:59] Speaker_B | Yes . And if neither , then we'll have to put something else ."
"[06:02] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , okay ."
[06:04] Speaker_C | Okay . So here we're missing soft component on the bottom .
"[06:09] Speaker_B | And I think you're probably right , soft component is a spectral feature ."
[06:10] Speaker_C | There .
[06:13] Speaker_C | If you get line I get soft component .
"[06:15] Speaker_A | Do you think ? Sorry , I I shouldn't intervene probably . But well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's u"
[06:25] Speaker_A | and we can point at it . And then it is a sp a sp spectral f f
[06:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:35] Speaker_C | You can point to a soft component .
[06:36] Speaker_B | You can point to a soft component .
[06:37] Speaker_A | You think ?
[06:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[06:39] Speaker_A | Okay , alright . Okay . Okay , okay ."
[06:41] Speaker_B | Is it ?
"[06:45] Speaker_B | Uh , now is a feature part of spectral feature ?"
[06:52] Speaker_B | I think you're right there as well .
"[06:52] Speaker_C | It c uh yeah , I'm not fussed about that . They both mean the same thing ."
[06:55] Speaker_B | 'Cause it it's not just absorption . But it's not just absorption point five K_V_ . It is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing .
[07:02] Speaker_B | If it was a
[07:05] Speaker_B | a dip in absorption or a
"[07:09] Speaker_B | a lack of absorption , you would put it in , because we said we would put describing words ."
[07:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:21] Speaker_C | Two down . Two hundred and fifteen to go . Excellent .
[07:28] Speaker_B | That's two .
[07:30] Speaker_C | Mm that's definitely two . You're right .
"[07:36] Speaker_B | Ah , there's one with the equivalent width . I think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width , but we were gonna mark the lines ."
[07:44] Speaker_C | I think that's true .
"[07:55] Speaker_C | What are we missing ? Broad line . Yeah , that's true . You get that ."
[07:56] Speaker_B | Broad line . And that should be a And nebulae .
[08:04] Speaker_B | As a source type .
[08:07] Speaker_C | I don't remember what we were doing with nebulae .
"[08:09] Speaker_C | We weren't doing like H_ two regions and stuff , were we ?"
[08:15] Speaker_C | I can't remember actually .
[08:18] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[08:22] Speaker_B | Yep .
[08:22] Speaker_C | Yes .
[08:27] Speaker_B | I what we're doing about that either .
"[08:29] Speaker_C | Mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes , in which case I'd argue for elliptical I think ."
"[08:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , that seems reasonable ."
"[08:42] Speaker_C | My God , I've just gone mad with the underlining here ."
"[08:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , I ."
"[08:53] Speaker_B | Breaking the power law index , I think that's probably a you can point to it , but equally it's not a it's something you've derived ."
"[08:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's the thing , but you wouldn't know it was a p yeah ."
[09:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:10] Speaker_B | So what's a breaking a power-law index ?
[09:12] Speaker_A | I think it's a feature . Um because in the s sp spectrum it does that and it does that . So it yeah . That's that is where it breaks . So yeah .
[09:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Yep .
"[09:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , b that thing there ."
[09:20] Speaker_B | Okay .
[09:22] Speaker_B | Slight depression of the continuum near the Lyman limit . I think you're right there as well .
[09:31] Speaker_B | But we're supposed to say w
"[09:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , i if it was absorption at H_ alpha , that would all be one . Or absorption at five thousand nanometres would all be one anyway ,"
[09:40] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:45] Speaker_B | because it was at a certain point .
[09:50] Speaker_B | But this is near .
[09:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:02] Speaker_C | Do you have a sense about that ?
"[10:05] Speaker_A | Oh , you want to s split that one and , do you , into two ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh I'd agree with that , I think ."
[10:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:08] Speaker_B | Yes .
[10:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:15] Speaker_B | Is that K_ clear ? Oh . .
[10:26] Speaker_B | Mm absorption .
[10:26] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[10:31] Speaker_C | That I didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption .
"[10:39] Speaker_B | Yes , and you're right there as well ."
[10:39] Speaker_C | Not the the thing .
[10:42] Speaker_B | Tell you who's more awake at this .
[10:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . An absorption feature .
"[10:50] Speaker_C | Yeah , if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave-length . But when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed , that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff . So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself ."
[10:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:56] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[11:03] Speaker_D | Cheers . Yeah .
[11:03] Speaker_A | Thanks .
[11:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay .
[11:07] Speaker_B | Thank you .
[11:10] Speaker_C | Thank you .
[11:12] Speaker_B | There is no steep soft component but our two K_V_ .
[11:23] Speaker_B | Mm .
[11:29] Speaker_C | It's not something you can point to .
"[11:35] Speaker_B | Yes , you could . I tend to miss out things if they're too long ."
"[11:54] Speaker_A | But if it had been there , um you would've"
"[11:57] Speaker_B | You would point to it . Yeah . Yes , I think you're right ."
"[11:57] Speaker_C | Marked it , yeah ."
[11:58] Speaker_A | had it as a feature .
[12:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:01] Speaker_B | Should we go back to number five ?
[12:05] Speaker_D | Is that the nebula ?
[12:06] Speaker_C | Huh ? Oh yeah . Yeah . What were we saying about nebula ? Source types .
"[12:06] Speaker_B | But yes , nebula . Mm-hmm ."
[12:07] Speaker_D | Was it the nebula thin Yeah .
"[12:26] Speaker_C | No , nebula counts , doesn't it ?"
"[12:30] Speaker_B | I think it does . We weren't matching a H_ two regions , because it was a region I think was the argument for that ."
[12:31] Speaker_C | Right .
[12:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:48] Speaker_B | Line again . Line in ratios . But I remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios , but we were going to mark 'cau we're here where you've got equivalent width of H_ beta orbited ."
"[12:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , but that's line ratios ."
[13:00] Speaker_B | Ratio is different I guess . Mm .
"[13:01] Speaker_C | Uh , line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios . It isn't it ? It's it's not talking about specific lines . A line ratio is a thing ."
[13:08] Speaker_B | I guess it's similar .
"[13:13] Speaker_A | Yeah , because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it ."
[13:18] Speaker_C | Right .
[13:20] Speaker_A | L line ratio is after abundances .
[13:25] Speaker_B | Is that the value or is that the word ?
[13:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:30] Speaker_B | Don't it in include the derived property ?
"[13:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include abundances or line strengths . Yeah , it shouldn't be in ."
[13:35] Speaker_A | No .
[13:36] Speaker_B | You wouldn't include line in that ? Okay . .
"[13:39] Speaker_C | I don't think . Whoop , no . Oh , I see what you're doing , you're circling the one we like , right ."
"[13:44] Speaker_B | The one to keep , yeah ."
[13:55] Speaker_B | You wouldn't mark the source type .
"[13:59] Speaker_C | Oh sorry , um yep ."
[14:00] Speaker_B | Here .
"[14:07] Speaker_B | Yes , because we don't want it underlined . It shouldn't be highlighted . So . Yeah . M"
"[14:09] Speaker_D | Right , sorry . Ok oh , I see , okay . Mm-hmm ."
"[14:23] Speaker_C | But damped Lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things , not spectral features ."
[14:27] Speaker_B | But th but you also absorb them by Y you observe them by their spectral feature . What were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example . We were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar .
"[14:41] Speaker_B | So I think it should be the same as that . If it's defined by a spectral feature , we should mark it ."
[14:51] Speaker_B | Here .
[14:56] Speaker_B | You could point to damped Lyman alpha though .
[14:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:59] Speaker_B | Because it says here , spectral features we're now referring to a type of source , E_G_ quasar ."
"[15:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , you could do ."
[15:05] Speaker_C | But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source .
"[15:10] Speaker_B | Um not a bis specific type of source , but I think still the the spectral feature ge counts , even though it's m a modifier of something ."
"[15:21] Speaker_B | What do you reckon , Bob ?"
[15:22] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[15:28] Speaker_A | Well , I mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th L Lyman alpha has been damped. ."
[15:37] Speaker_A | That is a n spectral feature .
"[15:51] Speaker_C | If you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way , you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah , that's a damp yeah . They're gonna be at different red-shifts ."
[15:55] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[16:00] Speaker_A | Different redshifts . Yeah yeah yeah , that's true ."
[16:02] Speaker_B | Y ye
[16:04] Speaker_B | But that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped Lyman alpha and that's damped Lyman alpha .
[16:11] Speaker_B | You could say all of that is damped Lyman alpha .
[16:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:18] Speaker_C | Well no , but you see them in all sorts of different red red-shifts . It's like the the Lyman alpha forest , sort of ."
[16:23] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[16:27] Speaker_C | And I'm not certain I would
[16:30] Speaker_C | I would mark that .
"[16:34] Speaker_B | It it if it was if it was some other spectral feature and then absorbers ,"
[16:42] Speaker_B | would we mark it ?
"[16:46] Speaker_C | Um no , I wouldn't , because it's they're physical things , not spectral features . You can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a d damped Lyman alpha some I g and I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type , and we wouldn't mark that source type ."
[17:02] Speaker_B | But we include modifiers of source types we would mark . We're not marking absorbers . But if it was a damped Lyman alpha quasar .
[17:03] Speaker_A | Wouldn't you ?
"[17:04] Speaker_C | We wouldn't mark absorbers , no ."
[17:07] Speaker_A | Wouldn't you have all of it ?
"[17:09] Speaker_B | then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped Lyman alpha . If it was broad absorption line quasar , we'd mark it . Yeah . So it's just I guess whether damped Lyman alpha is a spectral feature"
[17:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:21] Speaker_B | in itself . Which I would probably say it was , but then I've never looked at i one ."
[17:23] Speaker_C | Hmm it's tricky one .
[17:31] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:31] Speaker_A | And that it is altering the spectrum , isn't it ? I mean is a ch"
[17:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:36] Speaker_A | change in the s spectrum of
[17:36] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:39] Speaker_B | It doesn't have to be something that's specific . I guess y you know , we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum . And we include those ."
[17:40] Speaker_A | background objects .
"[17:49] Speaker_C | But we weren't going to include s descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting , were we ?"
"[17:55] Speaker_B | That true , but w we have included c power law though . Well no , we included p steep soft component , sorry . And here we included breaking the power law , because of the break ."
[17:56] Speaker_A | Uh is that right ?
[17:58] Speaker_C | Have we ?
"[18:06] Speaker_C | Steep soft component . Yeah , breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of . Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say , there it is . Yeah . Yeah ."
"[18:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . But there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep , you're saying . You know , what's steep and what's shallow ."
[18:25] Speaker_C | Yeah . That's grand . Yeah . Yes .
[18:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:28] Speaker_A | No .
"[18:32] Speaker_C | Um again I'd say this this is a physical process , not a spectral feature ."
"[18:36] Speaker_B | Yeah , you're right ."
[18:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:51] Speaker_B | Right , what have we got different here ?"
"[18:54] Speaker_C | Uh I don't have K_ star , but I should do ."
"[18:58] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's that one and this one here . Oh , we were including feature within spectral feature ."
[19:11] Speaker_B | Okay .
[19:12] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:18] Speaker_C | What's wrong with broad H_ alpha ?
"[19:20] Speaker_B | I think I just missed it . I think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum , it's still the s the line within it ."
[19:21] Speaker_C | Right .
[19:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:29] Speaker_C | Okay .
[19:31] Speaker_D | That was easy .
[19:42] Speaker_B | In this context .
[19:45] Speaker_B | Rather than a line . These are the lines .
[19:49] Speaker_B | I guess what you w
"[19:51] Speaker_B | If wasn't in there , then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the I think that means silicone two derived from these two features ."
[19:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[20:09] Speaker_A | That's actually an ionic species , isn't it actually ? Not a a spectral feature as such o on its own ."
"[20:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true , yeah ."
[20:11] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[20:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true ."
"[20:18] Speaker_C | Oh no , we're back to it again ."
[20:21] Speaker_B | Lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum .
"[20:31] Speaker_B | So we haven't basically , we just haven't got a a rule for"
[20:35] Speaker_B | spectral features within or referring to s types of source when we're not bother marking the source .
"[20:37] Speaker_C | Which we don't mark , yeah ."
[20:42] Speaker_C | But we can just be consistent .
"[20:42] Speaker_B | So are we marking H_ two and H_ two regions , for example ?"
"[20:46] Speaker_C | And I don't think we are , 'cause that's not a spectral feature in the spectrum we're looking at . Yeah ."
"[20:48] Speaker_B | Oh , that's true . But b yeah , but I guess it's not it's not defined by a spectral feature though , H_ two region , whereas"
[20:50] Speaker_A | No .
[20:54] Speaker_B | Lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of Lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have Lyman alpha forests .
"[21:01] Speaker_C | But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum , whereas a broad line quasar , someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line ."
[21:11] Speaker_B | But someone's l someone's looked at that spectrum .
"[21:11] Speaker_C | But if you're discussing Lyman alpha forest clouds , they could just be discussing the physical object , which we aren't marking ."
[21:18] Speaker_A | B b why aren't you marking it then ?
[21:22] Speaker_C | Because they weren't I don't know .
[21:26] Speaker_B | I don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or
[21:26] Speaker_C | Anything blobby I di I didn't mark . Yeah .
[21:31] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[21:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:37] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[21:42] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[21:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , but this is um species of cloud , it's a p"
[21:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:52] Speaker_A | a particular species of cloud , not just a general cloud , isn't it ? So isn't that different ?"
[21:58] Speaker_C | Mm .
[21:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
[22:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:11] Speaker_C | I think we just have to decide whether we're doing it .
"[22:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , but Bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds ."
[22:16] Speaker_B | Perhaps we should've done .
[22:19] Speaker_B | But we haven't done for the whole thing . So I think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission .
"[22:20] Speaker_A | Okay , th"
[22:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:21] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[22:22] Speaker_A | Then I guess not then . Yeah .
[22:26] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[22:30] Speaker_B | But then we still have to decide if we don't label the source , what do we do about the spectral features that define that source ?"
"[22:38] Speaker_B | I if we have for example broad absorption line object , we mark that . We mark broad absorption line in that ."
[22:44] Speaker_C | But that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad absorp absorption line object we have seen it .
"[22:48] Speaker_B | It's an but just to know this is a Lyman alpha forest cloud , we're seen Lyman alpha forest ."
[22:57] Speaker_A | But it's in this s sp sp sp sp spectrum of another object though . It it isn't the spectrum of the clouds . Yeah .
"[23:03] Speaker_B | But it's still a spectral feature , even if it's not it might be a spectral feature i not in the cloud , but it a spectral feature in the quasar , the Lyman alpha forest ."
[23:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . Let's keep them .
[23:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:22] Speaker_B | No one else can read that , sorry . Okay , so th Lyman alpha forest again ."
[23:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:25] Speaker_C | Nope . And here .
[23:30] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[23:32] Speaker_B | And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own then , 'cause it doesn't even say Lyman alpha forest clouds ."
[23:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[23:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[23:38] Speaker_B | Each helium two optical depth , I think that's elemental species ."
"[23:42] Speaker_C | There , that's derived , you're right ."
[23:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:49] Speaker_B | Oh . Oh , we marked the same lines ."
[23:53] Speaker_B | What have we done differently ?
[23:54] Speaker_C | Uh you've got line brightness temperatures .
"[24:00] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , we are ."
[24:06] Speaker_B | What was the one we didn't do before ? Line ratio we weren't doing .
"[24:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't think line brightness temperatures counts ."
[24:14] Speaker_C | 'Cause it's not talking about a specific line .
[24:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:17] Speaker_C | So Yeah .
"[24:17] Speaker_B | Was talking about l lines , okay ."
[24:20] Speaker_C | I don't think that counts .
"[24:26] Speaker_B | Line feature , need that ."
[24:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:39] Speaker_B | There's only one difference here .
"[24:40] Speaker_D | Oh sorry , I I thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry . No no , I I se okay , sorry . Yeah , I see ."
"[24:44] Speaker_C | Oh , no . Yeah , they're all the same ."
"[24:45] Speaker_B | No , no , they are the same otherwise . Quite impressively . That one's the same ."
"[24:50] Speaker_C | Yes , excellent . Um damped Lyman alpha again ."
[24:56] Speaker_C | Systems .
[25:00] Speaker_B | And damped Lyman alpha data .
[25:00] Speaker_A | Uh yeah .
[25:04] Speaker_C | That's a modifier of data .
[25:11] Speaker_C | I mean that's that's a description of the type of data . A d
[25:12] Speaker_B | If you said the spectral dat
[25:14] Speaker_B | The continuum's spet mm .
[25:17] Speaker_C | I really don't think that counts .
"[25:20] Speaker_B | But if it's a damped Lyman alpha spectrum , you'd mark damped Lyman alpha , because in the spectrum . And and a da is equivalent of spectrum ."
"[25:28] Speaker_C | I think just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase , you wouldn't for example , when we were saying silicone two levels , we didn't mark silicone two ."
[25:38] Speaker_C | That's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum .
[25:39] Speaker_B | That's because it was talking about s but if it's saying silicone two line .
[25:44] Speaker_B | Levels the new word .
"[25:45] Speaker_C | But what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped Lyman alpha measurements , and they tell us this answer . And this answer is inconsistent with that answer . Yeah , I don't think that's right ."
[25:54] Speaker_B | I think you're probably right in the case of it being data .
[26:08] Speaker_B | Mm .
[26:10] Speaker_A | It is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum
"[26:19] Speaker_A | But if you both want not to mark it , then fine , don't mark it ."
"[26:22] Speaker_B | Mm . If it's an emission line data , would we put it in ?"
"[26:26] Speaker_C | I wouldn't , but because it's a modifier of data ."
"[26:27] Speaker_B | But if it just said em but if it just said emission line , we would ."
[26:32] Speaker_B | It the emission line is strong . The emission line data shows strong .
"[26:39] Speaker_B | Then uh I think it's the same actually , I th I think it's data isn't even needed ."
"[26:54] Speaker_C | Oh feature , absolutely . B but"
"[26:58] Speaker_D | So from the perspective the named entity recognition task , so I th I think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something uh is sitting under a negation , right , the there was no um damped L_ Y_ alpha something , then um we then I think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that . Right , so it's more like uh a s it's uh uh it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality , which I mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so , then you'd probably be right in this case , right . But uh th given that the kind of thing is that that this named entity recogn task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing . Like really just fin finding these kind of strings . I think in this case um I w I would say this is probably an entity . Yeah ."
[27:00] Speaker_C | Mm .
[27:07] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:22] Speaker_A | Mm .
[27:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:27] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:42] Speaker_A | Right .
[27:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:46] Speaker_B | Okay . That's think enough .
[27:46] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[27:50] Speaker_B | Given that we can argue about it for ten minutes , it's probably not that clear-cut ."
[27:55] Speaker_C | Alright .
[27:56] Speaker_B | Damped Lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them . It should be damped Lyman alpha
"[27:57] Speaker_C | Take it again , but systems should be out . Yeah ."
"[28:03] Speaker_B | in red , whatever that is . Spectral feature ."
[28:09] Speaker_B | And that shouldn't be there at all .
[28:11] Speaker_C | Mm 'kay . You've done it again .
[28:13] Speaker_B | And I've done it twice .
[28:21] Speaker_B | Is that clear enough ?
[28:23] Speaker_C | Yes .
[28:27] Speaker_C | Right . Source type .
[28:30] Speaker_C | Did we have a rule about this ?
"[28:32] Speaker_B | We were including modifiers , including broad line quasars , non broad line quasars as well . So I think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your q with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum ."
[28:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[28:45] Speaker_C | Yep , that's true . That is true ."
[28:53] Speaker_B | We're ten percent of the way there .
[28:54] Speaker_C | Are we ? Excellent .
[28:58] Speaker_A | You have to s speed up . We'll go p could be here all day .
[28:59] Speaker_B | Continua .
"[29:01] Speaker_B | Oh gosh , it will be here forever . Remarkably soft ionising continua ."
"[29:06] Speaker_B | You're right though , I think . Or or continuum ."
[29:09] Speaker_C | See that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of ionising photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum . So I don't like that one .
"[29:17] Speaker_B | The absorbed continuum . Mm-hmm , yes ."
[29:25] Speaker_B | Oxygen shouldn't be there . That's not observed .
[29:25] Speaker_C | Oxygen abundance . Yeah .
[29:33] Speaker_C | Mm .
[29:39] Speaker_C | I'm happy enough with that .
[29:42] Speaker_B | Now what else is different ?
"[29:44] Speaker_C | Blue-shifted . that's okay with me , I don't care ."
"[29:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , you can have that as well ."
"[29:50] Speaker_B | Mm . Oh , thank you . And that one ."
[29:55] Speaker_C | Next .
"[29:59] Speaker_B | You're right , star-forming galaxies are distinct ."
[30:03] Speaker_C | I think they are .
[30:08] Speaker_C | I don't know why I did that . I don't like that at all .
"[30:08] Speaker_B | That's , yeah , derived . Probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour ."
"[30:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , could be that I was a bit sleepy . Lines from ions ?"
[30:23] Speaker_C | You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else .
[30:26] Speaker_B | You mean that ?
"[30:30] Speaker_C | Well I guess yeah , I dunno . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . That's true ."
[30:31] Speaker_B | If it was lines from H_ two you'd mark it .
[30:36] Speaker_C | That's true . Alright .
[30:38] Speaker_B | Blue wing flux . What were we gonna do about flux ?
[30:56] Speaker_B | Doesn't say .
"[30:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature , we'd mark feature . Hmm ."
"[31:06] Speaker_B | Yes , it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing . So I'm happy with that ."
[31:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:13] Speaker_B | Line peak .
"[31:20] Speaker_B | I think that should be marked . Even though it's talking about increasing line peak , it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing ."
[31:30] Speaker_B | Should actually be excess blue wing flux .
[31:34] Speaker_C | Possibly . Don't know .
[31:39] Speaker_B | Anyway .
[31:42] Speaker_B | I think line peak is something you can point to .
"[31:44] Speaker_C | You can point to it , but can you point to a line peak velocity shift ?"
[31:45] Speaker_A | Well I y
"[31:48] Speaker_B | No , but you can't you can't s also point to increa increasing blue wing ."
"[31:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , I don't think you can ."
[31:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[32:01] Speaker_A | Yeah , uh I don't think that's a feature ."
[32:05] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[32:10] Speaker_C | Mm there's a system issue again , so we should be consistent and keep it . Right ?"
[32:10] Speaker_B | Light .
[32:15] Speaker_B | Ye yes .
[32:26] Speaker_B | Right . Neutral hydrogen Gunn-Petersen absorption .
[32:33] Speaker_B | I think all of that's a spectral
[32:35] Speaker_B | feature .
"[32:38] Speaker_A | Really ? It's a process , isn't it ?"
[32:38] Speaker_B | It's basically a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen t it's a way of saying the Gunn-Petersen trough though .
[32:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[32:45] Speaker_B | Which , if you just said that it's Gunn-Petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a t if it was hydrogen absorption , you'd mark the whole thing . If it was hydrogen align you would , so you should mark if it was or H_ beta absorption . It's a marks the kind of spectral feature , doesn't it ?"
[32:49] Speaker_A | Isn't that a process ?
"[33:04] Speaker_A | It's a process , isn't it ?"
[33:06] Speaker_C | Mm .
[33:07] Speaker_B | But so is H_ beta absorp uh emission as a process from H_ beta . But it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen .
[33:15] Speaker_B | I guess what I'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there . And the fact that Gunn-Peterson comes between it
[33:20] Speaker_B | is just a pain .
[33:23] Speaker_A | Well it I wouldn't
[33:23] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[33:25] Speaker_A | have any of it , I think . I think all of that is um just that is process ."
[33:33] Speaker_A | Isn't it ?
[33:34] Speaker_C | I think I might agree with you .
[33:34] Speaker_B | Mm .
[33:42] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[33:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[33:46] Speaker_C | And if that shouldn't be marked , then that shouldn't be marked ."
[33:49] Speaker_B | Okay . Let's just cross everything out .
[33:57] Speaker_C | Right .
[34:01] Speaker_B | Blue-shifted absorption .
"[34:10] Speaker_B | I think it's a modifier of the thing , and so it probably should be there ."
[34:17] Speaker_C | Oh okay . Mm .
"[34:19] Speaker_B | As in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count , so I think blue-shifted should . Um"
[34:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:26] Speaker_B | that's talking about the line , isn't it ?"
[34:31] Speaker_B | So that should be in .
[34:36] Speaker_C | Hmm yes . Okay .
[34:38] Speaker_A | You think ?
"[34:50] Speaker_B | It's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property , it's just the strength of the lines ."
[34:58] Speaker_A | Actually is abundance really in a way .
[35:05] Speaker_B | I guess perhaps it is .
[35:06] Speaker_A | I'm not sure . Yeah .
[35:19] Speaker_B | I guess it could be abundance .
"[35:21] Speaker_C | B oh yeah , either that if that shouldn't be in , neither should either of those ."
"[35:27] Speaker_B | Yes , that's true . I think you probably should then , 'cause we will put in our align strength . Uh if it's a F_ i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in ."
[35:28] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[35:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right ."
[35:41] Speaker_A | Uh i
[35:46] Speaker_A | Isn't this an elemental um abundance
[35:50] Speaker_A | that you estimate actually using a number of lines ? Is it it isn't just one discrete
"[35:56] Speaker_A | line in the spectrum , is it ? B"
[35:59] Speaker_C | A feature ?
[36:00] Speaker_A | I'm not sure .
[36:00] Speaker_B | Its lines .
[36:02] Speaker_C | What do you mean ?
[36:03] Speaker_A | Well if you t
[36:06] Speaker_A | Two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of
[36:18] Speaker_A | On the abundance all of the s species actually use the old lines .
"[36:23] Speaker_B | But it's a strength rather than abundance . I think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the F_E_ two lines , rather than"
"[36:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know if we've marked things like silicone one"
[36:39] Speaker_C | throughout .
"[36:40] Speaker_B | In general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line , but I guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line . And I maybe it's not clear enough to mark ."
[36:42] Speaker_A | They haven't been if it's yeah .
[36:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[36:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[36:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[36:53] Speaker_B | Let's not mark it then .
"[36:53] Speaker_C | Yeah . If we don't mark it though , we definitely shouldn't mark these two , should we ?"
"[36:56] Speaker_B | Well line , narrow line . If it says it F_E_ two line strength then we would mark it , 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the ev element ."
[37:05] Speaker_C | Do you agree with that ?
"[37:06] Speaker_A | I think so , yeah ."
"[37:13] Speaker_A | Oh well , what's new ."
"[37:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think they mean l"
"[37:24] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , then have it in . Yeah , yeah , okay ."
"[37:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , let's leave it in ."
"[37:33] Speaker_C | Oh , is that what that means ?"
[37:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:35] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
[37:37] Speaker_C | Okay .
[37:39] Speaker_B | Um take out line .
[37:43] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[37:45] Speaker_B | And that's just the wrong
"[37:46] Speaker_C | Seyfert two . Oh , yep ."
"[37:48] Speaker_B | that's just the wrong colour , as is that ."
[37:51] Speaker_C | You're right .
[37:58] Speaker_B | I think you were right there .
"[37:59] Speaker_C | Radio loud counts , yeah ."
"[38:10] Speaker_B | Yep , you're right ."
[38:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[38:16] Speaker_B | And you're right there as well . That's a physical process .
[38:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[38:21] Speaker_C | Okay .
[38:26] Speaker_C | That counts .
"[38:27] Speaker_B | Yes , that was one I wasn't sure about , 'cause infrared . And if it was mid-infrar uh if it was , you'd put it in ."
[38:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[38:38] Speaker_B | That's just the wrong na that's just this should be a source name .
"[38:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , the and this shouldn't be , should it ?"
[38:45] Speaker_B | I don't know w
"[38:45] Speaker_C | M m does those count as modifiers active , we definitely include active ."
"[38:56] Speaker_C | It's a k kind of elliptical , is it ?"
[38:56] Speaker_A | What does that mean ?
[38:59] Speaker_C | A E_ two is a kind of elliptical . What I don't know what the J_ means .
"[38:59] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[39:06] Speaker_B | Uh I thought it was a catalogue .
[39:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[39:13] Speaker_B | H_ alpha I think should be marked , yeah ."
[39:16] Speaker_C | Those can does that not mean a a broad band detection ?
[39:21] Speaker_C | And does that count ?
"[39:23] Speaker_A | Sorry , what's the I can't see ."
[39:24] Speaker_C | Uh H_ alpha detection .
"[39:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , you're still detecting a line , even if you're detecting it from broad-band filters ."
[39:34] Speaker_C | But don't we say we don't do that ?
"[39:39] Speaker_C | Ah . I'm right , look . Don't include modifiers of regions or systems , E_G_"
"[39:46] Speaker_B | Broad line region , you are right ."
"[39:46] Speaker_C | region , systems . That's why I wasn't doing it ."
"[39:49] Speaker_B | And now align nebulae . Okay , we'll just go back and change those . You're right ."
[39:50] Speaker_A | Right .
"[39:50] Speaker_C | G ah , look at that ."
[40:05] Speaker_B | Um we have got nebulae marked here .
"[40:09] Speaker_B | Oh . Yeah , okay , modifiers with them , which is give a yell if you see one ."
[40:19] Speaker_B | So damped Lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there .
"[40:23] Speaker_C | Based on this , but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things . What's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point ?"
"[40:27] Speaker_B | But then I'm i I p I probably use that rule so half the time , and just forgotten to use at other times ."
[40:42] Speaker_B | Mm .
[40:43] Speaker_C | Right .
[40:47] Speaker_C | Right . Right . Yep
[40:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[40:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[40:52] Speaker_C | 'Cause you might have followed that rule . Right .
[40:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[40:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[40:56] Speaker_C | Alright .
[41:06] Speaker_B | Lyman alpha forest here .
[41:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[41:10] Speaker_B | But lyman alpha forest should be in here , because it's not talking about uh m it's not modified ."
"[41:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's fine ."
[41:20] Speaker_C | Damped Lyman alpha systems .
[41:32] Speaker_B | Data I think we should keep in .
[41:35] Speaker_B | Because it's would be the same as feature .
"[41:39] Speaker_B | Or spec spectrum . I think data's the same as spectrum , 'cause the data is a spec m"
"[41:48] Speaker_B | Final view , Bob ?"
[41:49] Speaker_C | I don't have passionate feelings .
[41:50] Speaker_A | I wouldn't I think now probably .
[41:51] Speaker_B | Okay .
[41:55] Speaker_B | Mm let's take that out .
[42:03] Speaker_B | And this one comes out as well .
[42:05] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[42:08] Speaker_B | Okay , so we want nothing ."
[42:14] Speaker_B | There .
[42:15] Speaker_B | Didn't it ?
[42:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[42:20] Speaker_B | Right .
[42:41] Speaker_C | Oops .
[42:42] Speaker_B | We're there . Right .
"[42:43] Speaker_C | Excellent . So what were we looking at this page for anyway ? It was for something else , H_ alpha detection ."
[42:46] Speaker_B | H_ alpha detection .
[42:52] Speaker_C | Broad band detections is in don't include .
[42:56] Speaker_B | But I wouldn't is H_ alpha broad-brand ? It's a line .
[43:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[43:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think so .
[43:08] Speaker_B | H_ alpha emitters are not
"[43:12] Speaker_B | a distinct class of source , I don't think ."
"[43:13] Speaker_C | No , they aren't ."
[43:17] Speaker_B | Line .
"[43:21] Speaker_D | Just out of curiosity , this narrow and broad band , that that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have ? Like t on the type of filter or is it oh , okay . Yeah , okay ."
"[43:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , exactly that . Yeah , exactly that ."
[43:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[43:28] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[43:31] Speaker_B | But I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature , even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a spectral feat feature ."
[43:38] Speaker_B | If you're picking out a line . What however you pick it out .
"[43:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[43:43] Speaker_A | Yep .
[43:45] Speaker_B | Line on its own .
"[43:48] Speaker_B | I think there's gonna be a lot of those , which makes life simpler ."
"[43:51] Speaker_C | Okay , yeah ."
[43:54] Speaker_C | Right .
"[44:00] Speaker_C | Uh , this is another systems thing ."
[44:02] Speaker_B | Yep .
[44:08] Speaker_B | Absorption profiles . I think that I think the whole thing should actually be marked .
[44:16] Speaker_B | Even this complex . How far should we go ?
[44:17] Speaker_C | Okay .
[44:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[44:21] Speaker_C | No .
"[44:21] Speaker_B | Comple just absorption , per ."
"[44:28] Speaker_C | Yeah , absorption profiles I'll go for . Why not ."
[44:42] Speaker_B | Lyman alpha forest line blanketing or Lyman alpha forest line ?
"[44:48] Speaker_C | Yeah , take out the blanketing ."
"[44:58] Speaker_C | Ah , right ."
[45:00] Speaker_B | Is it a system ?
[45:01] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[45:07] Speaker_B | V_L_B_A_ is an instrument . Oh , is it ?"
"[45:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , V_L_B_I_ is uh a net uh it's it's a V_L_B_I_ is it's a technique . It's not a yeah ."
[45:11] Speaker_B | Is a network . But is it ?
"[45:14] Speaker_A | Technique . Yeah . The network is an instrument though , isn't it ."
[45:17] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[45:23] Speaker_B | V_L_ b very long baseline array . V_L_B_A_ . If it had an A_ on the end , it would be the ne instrument ."
"[45:26] Speaker_A | It's E_V_N_ , isn't it ?"
"[45:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's called a V_L_B_A_ ."
[45:32] Speaker_C | V_L_B_I_ network image . So do they mean the V_L_B_A_ .
"[45:39] Speaker_A | This is an instrument if you have it all , isn't it ?"
"[45:42] Speaker_C | European V_L_B_I_ net . Is it in it it's an intstru group instrument , not a research group ."
[45:47] Speaker_A | I think so .
"[45:47] Speaker_B | Yes , 'cause it ta it takes an image . So Oh , but then a m research group could take an image . Okay , let's oh , how much of modifiers are we putting in ?"
[45:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[45:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[45:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[46:01] Speaker_A | Which it is , uh I think ."
"[46:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , is that so this whole thing is an instrument , you say ."
[46:06] Speaker_B | From one point six or from European ?
[46:07] Speaker_A | That's what I think .
[46:08] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[46:08] Speaker_A | Oh , I think it's uh um s s s starting with um Eu European I think ."
[46:12] Speaker_B | Or just um V_L_B_A_
[46:21] Speaker_B | He's using capitals . But s
"[46:22] Speaker_C | Oh , I see , I see . Yeah ."
[46:25] Speaker_C | So is this like it's a subset of the V_L_B_A_ ?
[46:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[46:28] Speaker_A | Uh yes .
[46:30] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[46:31] Speaker_A | Just in Europe .
[46:32] Speaker_C | Right .
"[46:35] Speaker_A | But it's actually Merlin and all the i um international logs in Europe , all"
[46:40] Speaker_A | hooked up into one instrument basically . Yeah .
[46:42] Speaker_C | Cool .
[46:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[46:45] Speaker_C | Right .
[46:48] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[46:51] Speaker_C | That is a source name , you're right ."
"[47:01] Speaker_B | That's just broad-band , isn't it ? Broad line emission ."
[47:06] Speaker_B | So that shouldn't be marked .
[47:15] Speaker_B | Radio-loud objects . It's not ve it's not a m mod It's not an original system . M
"[47:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . We say something about objects , and I think it's that we don't use it ."
[47:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[47:31] Speaker_B | So none of those .
[47:37] Speaker_B | Yep .
[47:41] Speaker_B | Now we've both marked line ratios here .
"[47:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , but we shouldn't have done ."
[47:49] Speaker_B | And that's the same .
"[47:49] Speaker_C | So that's it , yeah ."
[47:54] Speaker_B | Continuum .
"[48:00] Speaker_B | And there it's different , because you're talking about the ionizing continuum , which is a pre"
"[48:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , that means that's a proc it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons , that's not the continuum you're looking at ."
[48:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[48:16] Speaker_B | I think you can point to line pairs .
"[48:18] Speaker_C | Sure you can , yep ."
[48:22] Speaker_B | And that shouldn't be in there .
[48:23] Speaker_C | Mm nope .
[48:30] Speaker_C | Excellent .
[48:34] Speaker_B | You're right there . That's all one big spectral feature .
[48:41] Speaker_B | And nebula shouldn't be marked .
[48:45] Speaker_C | Have we agreed on that ?
[48:47] Speaker_B | What do we do back here ?
"[48:48] Speaker_C | We only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula , but I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula . Yeah ."
"[48:54] Speaker_B | What did we do back here ? We did mark nebula , yes ."
"[49:02] Speaker_B | It was things that weren't distinct , like yeah ."
"[49:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula . I think is why I wasn't doing it ."
[49:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[49:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , yeah , it's a difficult one . But if we're gonna stick to it , let's stick to it ."
"[49:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . If we're going to have them , let's have them ."
[49:20] Speaker_C | What's different ?
"[49:22] Speaker_C | Oh , yeah . Um , don't mind ."
"[49:25] Speaker_B | And I think we need the . I think we would put stop putting the in , we could get confused . And you're right there ."
[49:29] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[49:30] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[49:40] Speaker_C | You're right .
[49:41] Speaker_C | There .
[49:43] Speaker_C | Source type .
"[49:43] Speaker_B | Oh , yeah ."
[49:49] Speaker_C | Line blanketing .
"[49:49] Speaker_B | Line blanketing , you think y"
"[49:52] Speaker_C | Sh I no , I don't think I did I ?"
[49:55] Speaker_B | We had line blanketing just now and we included it . I think we sh um .
[49:55] Speaker_C | So that yeah . Did we ?
[49:57] Speaker_A | Did you ? I thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included .
[50:03] Speaker_B | Where was it ?
"[50:05] Speaker_C | We did just have it , don't know . It wasn't that far back , was it ? No , it wasn't that far back ."
[50:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[50:10] Speaker_B | Don't think n Lyman f forest line blanket , we took blanketing out ."
"[50:14] Speaker_C | Line yeah , we took blanketing out , so I don't think that should be in ."
[50:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[50:22] Speaker_B | And that's all the same .
[50:22] Speaker_C | Is that it ? Yeah .
[50:27] Speaker_C | Uh that's a source nine .
"[50:32] Speaker_B | Yes . Yes , it is ."
[50:32] Speaker_C | Isn't it ?
[50:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[50:35] Speaker_B | Red and blue components .
[50:39] Speaker_B | I think you're right there as well .
[50:43] Speaker_C | Mm .
[50:46] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . I think I'm right .
[50:51] Speaker_A | Really ?
"[50:54] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think i in the same way that you can point to"
"[50:58] Speaker_C | Oh , yeah ."
"[51:01] Speaker_A | Well I would argue about that,you see , because I think that I mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a sp spectrum , don't you ?"
[51:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[51:10] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[51:19] Speaker_A | Yeah . But , have a component though as such ."
"[51:24] Speaker_B | But we're talking about the c the continuum though . If you have a galaxy spectrum though , you can say there's the blue component , there's the red component to the spectrum . Oh , I see what you mean , i like it comes from adding two different things together ."
"[51:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , g um c"
[51:36] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[51:37] Speaker_B | I can see that , yeah ."
"[51:42] Speaker_A | It's actually really um after you actually model the s a spectrum , not just actually looking at the spectrum . Yeah , you think ?"
[51:43] Speaker_C | But results from spectral .
[51:47] Speaker_B | Yes .
[52:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[52:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , but um component it is m means it's an element actually in the model though ."
"[52:05] Speaker_C | Mm . Yeah . Yeah , I'd take out red and blue ."
"[52:08] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , okay ."
"[52:22] Speaker_A | The excesses , yeah . But um the component isn't ."
[52:23] Speaker_C | Yeah . It's just a t
"[52:25] Speaker_B | If you modelled it with two parts , one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum Hubble in Hubble deep field south ."
[52:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
"[52:29] Speaker_C | That's probably true , yeah ."
[52:33] Speaker_C | Um Hubble and Hubble deep sent to us .
[52:38] Speaker_B | I didn't include it . Although it does apply to the telescope . But mm .
[52:41] Speaker_A | I think I would . Yeah .
[52:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[52:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[52:46] Speaker_B | Let's keep it in .
[52:46] Speaker_C | So should w did we have a soft component earlier ? So we sh should kill it .
[52:52] Speaker_B | Anyone remember when ?
[52:57] Speaker_B | Let's start at the beginning .
[52:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[53:01] Speaker_C | There it is .
[53:01] Speaker_B | Oh . Excellent .
[53:10] Speaker_C | Right .
[53:11] Speaker_B | Hubble . .
[53:12] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[53:19] Speaker_B | No wait , the top one I think you should include ."
[53:23] Speaker_B | Possibly with flux as well though .
"[53:28] Speaker_C | Mm d yeah , okay ."
"[53:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's fine , I'm happy with all that ."
"[53:39] Speaker_B | And then yes , the whole thing ."
[53:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[53:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , that counts ."
[54:04] Speaker_C | Do we ha did we s make a decision about radio galaxies ? 'Cause I think
"[54:09] Speaker_C | they are discussed as a separate source type , aren't they ?"
[54:13] Speaker_A | Where are they ?
[54:16] Speaker_A | Uh only just
[54:19] Speaker_A | Interesting because on the hour it yeah .
[54:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[54:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[54:27] Speaker_A | No .
[54:29] Speaker_A | No it is yeah .
"[54:33] Speaker_C | Where part of it's useful . I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing , aren't you ? Yeah , so you're right ."
"[54:36] Speaker_B | Yes , I think you are ."
[54:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[54:48] Speaker_B | Seyfert one point eight and one point nine galaxies
[54:53] Speaker_C | It's a sub-classification of Seyfert's . would make a s study Seyfert one point eights . Oh do they ?
"[55:00] Speaker_A | Well people do though , don't they ? I mean it's pretty s stupid , but they do ."
[55:06] Speaker_B | I think they probably are .
"[55:08] Speaker_C | You're right , yeah ."
"[55:08] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so ."
[55:09] Speaker_B | Inseparate . And it's just the and that annoys .
"[55:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's fine ."
[55:13] Speaker_B | Mission line feature we're gonna include .
[55:14] Speaker_C | Uh yep .
[55:21] Speaker_B | Galaxy when it's a process . Yes .
"[55:26] Speaker_C | And yes , that counts ."
"[55:28] Speaker_B | Ah , now this is one"
"[55:31] Speaker_B | where it should be this one , but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined ? Has it just plotted the top colour ?"
[55:40] Speaker_B | Yes .
[55:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[55:43] Speaker_D | I don't know wh which one it would display then .
[55:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[55:56] Speaker_B | I can't write .
"[55:57] Speaker_D | I I actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations ? Right , okay ."
"[55:59] Speaker_B | We changed it so that you could . Yeah , because quite often uh an object class is defined by a spectral feature ."
[56:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
[56:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Okay .
[56:09] Speaker_B | Like broad line radio galaxies .
[56:10] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[56:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[56:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[56:16] Speaker_B | Broader lines , I think ."
"[56:27] Speaker_C | Don't mind . Oh , up here ."
"[56:27] Speaker_B | List the wrong wrong colour for a few things . Oh , it's all here . Hyper-luminous galaxy ."
"[56:34] Speaker_A | If you're having ultra-loom this early on , then I think you have to have here ."
[56:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[56:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[56:40] Speaker_B | This is just a colour issue .
[56:40] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[56:42] Speaker_C | Is it ? Or is it oh , right . And Q_S_O_ is not yeah , you're right ."
"[56:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , they should all be and that one ."
[57:00] Speaker_B | So it probably shouldn't be in there .
[57:03] Speaker_C | The I_S_M_ isn't a source type . Is it ?
[57:06] Speaker_B | Oh . No .
[57:07] Speaker_A | I don't think so .
[57:09] Speaker_B | What we doing about nebula again ? I've forgotten .
"[57:12] Speaker_C | We're now including nebula , aren't we ?"
[57:14] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
"[57:18] Speaker_C | Mm what have we done , features ."
[57:21] Speaker_B | Features .
[57:28] Speaker_C | Mm yep . .
[57:29] Speaker_B | Flat spectrum radio quasars .
[57:36] Speaker_B | Strong drop in the continuum . I think you're right there .
[57:39] Speaker_C | Okay .
[57:43] Speaker_C | Nope .
[57:44] Speaker_B | I think you're right again . That's just the place .
[57:47] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[57:59] Speaker_B | Um we're not doing emission line when it's a modifier of objects , are we ?"
"[58:03] Speaker_C | Oh no , we aren't doing that either , you're right ."
[58:05] Speaker_B | The question is are emission line objects a separate class of source ? I think they are .
"[58:10] Speaker_C | Mm no . They aren't , are they ?"
[58:12] Speaker_A | But t y are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though ?
[58:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[58:17] Speaker_B | Yes , you're right ."
"[58:19] Speaker_C | Yeah , anything to do with objects . So nothing ."
"[58:21] Speaker_B | And Seyfert galaxies w should be one , you're right there ."
[58:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[58:31] Speaker_B | I got three seventy .
"[58:34] Speaker_D | That's pretty good , that's nearly a third ."

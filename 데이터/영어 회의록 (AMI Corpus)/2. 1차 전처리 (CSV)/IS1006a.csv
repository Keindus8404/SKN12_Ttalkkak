[00:19] Speaker_B | Oops .
"[00:20] Speaker_A | So , hello everyone . We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin ."
"[00:47] Speaker_A | I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting ."
"[01:13] Speaker_A | So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly ."
"[01:26] Speaker_A | Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design ."
"[01:51] Speaker_A | Um , so let's try the whiteboard . Um so any of you who want to go ."
"[02:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , for favourite animals . It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . And it's gonna be you'll try to guess ."

[04:34] Speaker_B | Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . According to the drawings . Okay .
[04:47] Speaker_D | So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
"[04:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . We aim to do this profit ."
[04:53] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[04:55] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[05:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , we're to sell two million then ."
[05:11] Speaker_B | Wow .
[05:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[05:13] Speaker_A | Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum .
[05:32] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .

[05:51] Speaker_B | Children proof .
[05:53] Speaker_B | Hmm .

"[05:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , pret"
[06:12] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:21] Speaker_D | So it has to be very robust .

"[06:24] Speaker_D | Unbreakable , yeah ."
"[06:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah ."
[06:24] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[06:28] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:29] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:30] Speaker_D | And uh
[06:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:37] Speaker_A | Colourful , yeah mm ."
[06:38] Speaker_B | Colourful ? That's not practical .
"[06:39] Speaker_D | colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b"
[06:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:41] Speaker_A | No , that's a good idea ."
"[06:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's always black or yeah ."
[06:43] Speaker_A | Mm mm-mm .
[06:44] Speaker_B | No .
[06:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[06:53] Speaker_A | No , because you think , why not ."
[06:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:55] Speaker_D | One colour .
[06:55] Speaker_B | Otherwise you will never find it .
[06:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[07:00] Speaker_D | Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah ."
[07:02] Speaker_B | Cool .
[07:03] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:08] Speaker_D | Good .
[07:08] Speaker_A | Good idea .
[07:10] Speaker_C | And it should be really small and .
[07:14] Speaker_C | Huh not so big like yeah .
"[07:17] Speaker_A | No uh , not too much buttons or mm ."
[07:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:34] Speaker_C | Uh .
[07:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:42] Speaker_D | Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .
[07:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:54] Speaker_C | Yeah . Colour , size , sh"
[07:55] Speaker_A | So you you think it's better if small
[07:59] Speaker_A | than bigger .
[08:00] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[08:03] Speaker_B | Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay ."
"[08:06] Speaker_A | No , not too small , yeah ."
"[08:07] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like ."
[08:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:11] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[08:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , like a palm sized ."
[08:13] Speaker_D | Mm .
[08:14] Speaker_B | Just to hold it .
[08:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , at least the colour would be different ."
[08:33] Speaker_A | Mm .
[08:33] Speaker_C | Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .
[08:36] Speaker_D | I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place .
"[08:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[08:43] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[08:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:48] Speaker_D | So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno ."
"[08:51] Speaker_A | Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no ."
"[09:02] Speaker_B | No , no screens , it's too complex ."
[09:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[09:05] Speaker_C | Mm . Too expensive , yeah ."
"[09:06] Speaker_B | And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . But no screens on remote controls ."
[09:07] Speaker_A | And too expensive .
[09:11] Speaker_D | Ah .
[09:14] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .
[09:14] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[09:23] Speaker_D | So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like ."
[09:23] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:27] Speaker_C | Ye yeah .
[09:32] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[09:36] Speaker_C | I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah ."
[09:38] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
"[09:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , for instance , mm ."
"[09:45] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ."
[09:46] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .
[09:46] Speaker_D | Mm .
[09:50] Speaker_A | So adaptable yeah something yeah .
"[09:52] Speaker_B | Adaptable . Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?"
"[09:52] Speaker_D | Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah ."
[09:53] Speaker_C | Mm huh .
[09:58] Speaker_B | On off ?
[09:58] Speaker_C | Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .
[10:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:03] Speaker_C | We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations ."
[10:12] Speaker_B | I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
[10:17] Speaker_C | Two .
[10:17] Speaker_D | Three buttons you mean ?
[10:19] Speaker_A | Three option .
[10:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:25] Speaker_A | Um .
[10:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[10:41] Speaker_A | Hmm . If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may
"[10:50] Speaker_A | may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah ."
"[10:54] Speaker_B | Sh sure , sure ."
"[10:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time ."
[10:55] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[10:59] Speaker_B | But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else ."
[11:07] Speaker_D | Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .
[11:13] Speaker_C | Mm .
[11:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:19] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . You do this ?
[11:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:23] Speaker_B | I usually just change channels .
"[11:36] Speaker_A | Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah ."
[11:39] Speaker_C | Dash .
"[11:42] Speaker_D | And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was ."
"[11:45] Speaker_A | Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool ."
[11:45] Speaker_B | Uh-huh . Go back button is good . I once had it .
[11:46] Speaker_C | Yeah you can yeah .
[11:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:49] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah , the previous button is ."
[11:51] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[11:52] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[11:56] Speaker_C | Oh uh .
[12:01] Speaker_C | Uh .
[12:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:14] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
[12:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
[12:33] Speaker_A | work on these ideas and try to make a
"[12:37] Speaker_A | uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want ."
[12:55] Speaker_A | Um .
[13:05] Speaker_D | So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?
[13:10] Speaker_B | Market Expert .
[13:11] Speaker_C | Marketing yeah .
"[13:11] Speaker_D | Uh that's me . Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah ."
[13:19] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[13:21] Speaker_D | Okay . I'll think of that .
[13:22] Speaker_A | Mm okay .
[13:30] Speaker_A | So .

[00:00] Speaker_A | Alright so twenty five .
[00:03] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay .
[00:10] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[00:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[00:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , yeah . So presumably that might be an idea to"
[00:20] Speaker_D | Yeah the universal ones . Yeah .
[00:21] Speaker_A | Mm .
[00:25] Speaker_A | But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .
[00:26] Speaker_C | put into .
[00:26] Speaker_B | Slim .
[00:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[00:30] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about"
"[00:35] Speaker_C | I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ?"
"[00:38] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , it's about that ."
[00:38] Speaker_C | And that's quite a lot for a remote control .
"[00:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[00:40] Speaker_D | Mm . Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ?"
[00:51] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[00:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:05] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:12] Speaker_D | Because we always lose our remote control .
[01:14] Speaker_A | Right .
[01:39] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[01:46] Speaker_B | So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , so , yes , all this ."

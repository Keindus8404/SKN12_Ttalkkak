"[00:47] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops ."
[01:00] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[01:00] Speaker_C | Ah , pinball ."
[01:07] Speaker_B | Oh .
[01:12] Speaker_A | Very good .
[01:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[01:25] Speaker_B | Mine . Oh , great ."
[01:32] Speaker_D | Very interesting .
[01:51] Speaker_A | Industrial Designer . Interface concept .
"[02:04] Speaker_B | Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh"
"[02:12] Speaker_B | uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences ."
"[02:36] Speaker_B | Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display ."
[03:05] Speaker_D | Large . A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
"[03:06] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top"
[03:17] Speaker_B | uh left or right .
"[03:21] Speaker_B | Um , well we see the the the same uh"
"[03:31] Speaker_B | Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue ."
"[03:34] Speaker_B | And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that ."
[03:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[04:04] Speaker_A | For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?"
[04:10] Speaker_A | We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
[04:26] Speaker_B | Like this . Or or this .
[04:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:31] Speaker_B | And that the menu button is okay .
"[04:32] Speaker_A | Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows ."
[04:36] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[04:39] Speaker_B | The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean ."
[04:41] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
[04:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[04:49] Speaker_C | Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it ."
[04:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[04:56] Speaker_B | Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case ."
"[05:18] Speaker_B | Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think ."
"[05:36] Speaker_A | No , it's not flower power ."
[05:40] Speaker_A | S okay .
"[05:45] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh"
[05:54] Speaker_B | opinion .
[05:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:57] Speaker_B | That was that .
[05:58] Speaker_A | Thank you .
"[06:00] Speaker_A | So , you're next ."
"[06:02] Speaker_C | I'm next , okay ."
[06:23] Speaker_C | Yes . No . Here we go .
"[06:27] Speaker_C | Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also ."
[06:30] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[06:47] Speaker_C | First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said ."
"[07:04] Speaker_C | Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then ,"
"[07:24] Speaker_C | I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket ."
"[07:41] Speaker_C | Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved ."
"[07:57] Speaker_C | And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research ."
"[08:19] Speaker_C | Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel ."
"[08:40] Speaker_C | And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb ."
"[08:55] Speaker_C | And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one ."
[08:56] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[09:02] Speaker_C | The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it ."
"[09:28] Speaker_C | And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive ."
"[09:46] Speaker_C | And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera ."
[10:08] Speaker_C | You have any more questions about this ?
"[10:13] Speaker_C | I think the main thing is we look at the costs . And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has ."
[10:13] Speaker_D | Yep .
[10:16] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[10:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:21] Speaker_D | But , thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , not ."
[10:24] Speaker_C | Not with an L_C_D_ . No .
"[10:26] Speaker_A | No , isn't . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons ."
"[10:33] Speaker_A | Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push ."
[10:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[10:36] Speaker_C | But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher ."
[10:40] Speaker_A | But then it's not easy to use scroll uh
[10:44] Speaker_A | wheel .
[10:45] Speaker_C | Th then you'll see it on the television .
"[10:48] Speaker_A | Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up ."
[10:53] Speaker_A | When you scroll .
"[10:53] Speaker_C | Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty ."
"[11:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which"
[11:22] Speaker_C | can provide our uh remote control .
[11:24] Speaker_A | Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room .
[11:32] Speaker_C | Yes .
[11:34] Speaker_C | But that won't be a problem .
[11:37] Speaker_C | I think .
[11:37] Speaker_A | Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
"[11:42] Speaker_C | No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news ."
[12:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:06] Speaker_D | Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?"
"[12:19] Speaker_D | 'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better ."
[12:19] Speaker_A | That's important .
[12:23] Speaker_C | That's true .
"[12:28] Speaker_C | But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ ."
[12:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:55] Speaker_A | Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . It's very important .
"[13:15] Speaker_C | Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip ."
"[13:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?"
[13:36] Speaker_A | Oh .
[13:36] Speaker_D | Huh .
[13:36] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[13:39] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:43] Speaker_C | That's from my manufacturing division .
"[13:46] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , thank you . Next ."
[13:50] Speaker_D | My turn ?
[13:51] Speaker_C | Yes ?
"[14:09] Speaker_D | Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell ."
"[14:22] Speaker_D | So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends ."
"[14:37] Speaker_D | And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products ."
"[14:57] Speaker_D | And um , material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it ."
"[15:09] Speaker_D | Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture ."
[15:22] Speaker_D | To get a feeling for this .
"[15:25] Speaker_D | Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different ."
"[15:42] Speaker_D | And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind ."
[15:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:05] Speaker_D | Any questions ?
[16:06] Speaker_C | Nope .
[16:07] Speaker_B | No .
[16:07] Speaker_A | No . It's clear .
"[16:13] Speaker_A | So now ,"
"[16:16] Speaker_A | it's uh Ah , let's see ."
"[16:28] Speaker_A | Now , w we have to decide"
"[16:55] Speaker_A | Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board ."
"[17:03] Speaker_A | First , uh user interface ."
"[17:08] Speaker_C | Uh , uh-uh ."
[17:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?"
[17:31] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[17:40] Speaker_B | Mm , yes ."
[17:40] Speaker_A | Shapes or What do we need ?
[17:46] Speaker_D | Can make several uh concepts .
[17:47] Speaker_B | What ?
"[17:49] Speaker_A | Yes , okay ."
"[17:50] Speaker_D | We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand ."
[17:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[17:58] Speaker_C | M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . Uh I have to . I'm not a designer . It's more three D_ . Like , um when you have"
[18:00] Speaker_A | And you have to .
[18:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:13] Speaker_C | a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like
[18:25] Speaker_B | Mm .
[18:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:29] Speaker_D | A g Mm . .
"[18:30] Speaker_A | So , it has to be soft ?"
"[18:32] Speaker_C | And it has to be soft , yeah ."
[18:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[18:35] Speaker_C | So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? Buttons on top of it . And here ."
"[18:35] Speaker_A | And uh , the buttons ?"
[18:39] Speaker_A | Buttons .
[18:44] Speaker_C | The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
[18:48] Speaker_B | But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
[18:53] Speaker_C | But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . And the b
"[18:59] Speaker_A | But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels ."
[19:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:03] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Or two buttons .
[19:06] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[19:06] Speaker_A | Uh , two scroll uh wheels ."
"[19:08] Speaker_C | If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back"
[19:15] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:16] Speaker_A | That's th that's more difficult .
"[19:18] Speaker_D | But if we have uh a me Yeah . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?"
"[19:24] Speaker_C | with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it ."
[19:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:40] Speaker_A | But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
"[19:45] Speaker_C | Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu ."
[19:45] Speaker_D | Uh-uh .
"[19:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? You don't know . So , there's no menu ."
[19:56] Speaker_C | I don't know .
[20:02] Speaker_A | No . So you can't use it .
"[20:06] Speaker_C | And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher ."
"[20:13] Speaker_A | Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ ."
[20:17] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[20:26] Speaker_C | With the scroll button . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it ."
[20:27] Speaker_A | That's one .
[20:29] Speaker_D | Uh-uh .
[20:40] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:46] Speaker_A | It's one .
[20:47] Speaker_A | Two . Number two .
"[20:58] Speaker_A | No . But when you handle it , you put it on and off ."
[21:03] Speaker_A | It's not good to use .
"[21:14] Speaker_A | No , it's not good . Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ ."
[21:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:27] Speaker_C | Paint it ? With the scroll thing on , like this ?"
[21:30] Speaker_A | One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah .
"[21:35] Speaker_A | Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ ."
[21:36] Speaker_C | So ?
[23:01] Speaker_A | Not so difficult .
"[23:08] Speaker_A | Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen ."
"[23:11] Speaker_B | Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose ."
[23:18] Speaker_A | For the menu .
[23:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:22] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . One
[23:27] Speaker_A | that way . And one
[23:31] Speaker_A | that way .
[23:38] Speaker_A | Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .
[23:47] Speaker_A | When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .
[23:52] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[23:58] Speaker_C | Separate , more separate , h yeah ."
"[24:00] Speaker_A | Yes , okay ."
"[24:03] Speaker_C | Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button ."
[24:53] Speaker_A | Very good .
[24:57] Speaker_A | Is it better ?
"[25:00] Speaker_A | When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there ."
[25:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the First the buttons ."
"[25:16] Speaker_C | Okay , okay , okay ."
[25:18] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[25:31] Speaker_D | The mute button .
[25:33] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
"[25:34] Speaker_D | We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers"
[25:42] Speaker_A | Mute . And the other .
"[25:51] Speaker_C | Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle ."
[25:58] Speaker_A | But how do you wanna solve it ?
[26:00] Speaker_C | With the switch button .
[26:03] Speaker_A | Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
"[26:06] Speaker_A | Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down ."
[26:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:16] Speaker_A | A joystick .
"[26:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , and joystick , I think ."
"[26:22] Speaker_A | Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop ."
"[26:27] Speaker_C | Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi"
[26:37] Speaker_C | I don't know .
[26:59] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[27:00] Speaker_C | Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And No , no . It won't work ."
[27:07] Speaker_A | For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
[27:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . Uh-huh .
[27:16] Speaker_A | Think we have to keep them .
[27:21] Speaker_C | Or a remote control more like joystick .
"[27:25] Speaker_A | Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better ."
[27:30] Speaker_A | A small one .
"[27:31] Speaker_C | A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k"
[27:34] Speaker_A | No just like in a
[27:36] Speaker_C | Playstation thing .
"[27:37] Speaker_A | a laptop . Small , round ."
[27:41] Speaker_A | Then it's
[27:44] Speaker_A | not so big .
"[27:45] Speaker_C | No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing ."
"[27:48] Speaker_A | Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand ."
[27:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:00] Speaker_A | Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one ."
"[28:08] Speaker_A | So , please look at it ."
"[28:32] Speaker_D | And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?"
[28:39] Speaker_C | Uh they're not uh
[28:47] Speaker_A | Yeah we I think you get it .
"[28:54] Speaker_A | So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it ."
[29:04] Speaker_A | Yes .
[29:04] Speaker_C | I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .
[29:08] Speaker_A | Your problem . Not mine .
[29:15] Speaker_C | Then I'll uh make something up .
"[29:17] Speaker_A | Okay . So , do we have other concepts ?"
"[29:25] Speaker_A | Then for the components ,"
[29:28] Speaker_A | we use a normal battery .
"[29:32] Speaker_B | Mm , yeah ."
"[29:34] Speaker_A | Ch cheapest way , I think ."
"[29:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah ."
"[29:36] Speaker_A | No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery ."
[29:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:43] Speaker_D | Yes .
[29:43] Speaker_C | Okay .
[29:54] Speaker_A | Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
[29:57] Speaker_C | Depends on the scroll .
[30:00] Speaker_A | Scroll .
"[30:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to"
[30:10] Speaker_C | Uh the most expensive . Yeah .
"[30:12] Speaker_A | Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay ."
"[30:15] Speaker_C | If we Yeah . If we No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip ."
"[30:26] Speaker_A | Okay . So , uh the shapes of the"
"[30:36] Speaker_A | depends on the L_C_D_ and But ,"
[30:40] Speaker_A | it has to be small .
[30:43] Speaker_A | I think .
[30:44] Speaker_C | Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?
"[30:49] Speaker_A | If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy ."
[30:55] Speaker_C | Just use your thumb .
[30:59] Speaker_A | If you use a phone .
[31:00] Speaker_C | If you Yeah . I use my thumb .
[31:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:09] Speaker_A | Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen ."
"[31:13] Speaker_C | No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh straight ."
[31:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:27] Speaker_A | No . No , no ."
"[31:29] Speaker_C | That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think ."
"[31:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y"
[31:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:39] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
"[31:40] Speaker_A | N well , if you have to look at it ."
[31:44] Speaker_C | 'Kay . Here's our designer .
"[31:47] Speaker_D | If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ ."
[31:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:56] Speaker_A | Then it goes like this .
"[32:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , why not ."
"[32:07] Speaker_A | Yes , of course . That's good good . But the um , it may not break ."
[32:15] Speaker_C | Now we put uh rubber around it .
[32:18] Speaker_A | Okay . If that's possible .
"[32:19] Speaker_D | Um , Yeah ."
"[32:20] Speaker_C | Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber ."
[32:28] Speaker_A | Okay .
[32:30] Speaker_B | Or you can uh
[32:32] Speaker_B | turn it inside .
"[32:34] Speaker_D | But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it ."
[32:41] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[32:41] Speaker_B | No , that's true ."
[32:46] Speaker_C | This is something new .

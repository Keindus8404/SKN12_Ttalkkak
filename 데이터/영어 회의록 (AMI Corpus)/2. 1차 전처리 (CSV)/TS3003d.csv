[00:22] Speaker_D | Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic .
[00:26] Speaker_A | No problem .
"[00:29] Speaker_A | Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting ."
[00:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[00:47] Speaker_A | There he is .
[00:51] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[01:20] Speaker_A | And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda ."
"[01:40] Speaker_A | We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote ."
"[02:09] Speaker_A | But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um"
"[02:25] Speaker_A | we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward ."
[02:33] Speaker_C | Okay .
[02:37] Speaker_C | Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
"[02:51] Speaker_C | Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen ."
[03:04] Speaker_C | Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
[03:15] Speaker_C | So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .
[03:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[03:27] Speaker_D | Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?"
[03:33] Speaker_C | Sure uh just pop in at any time .
[03:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[03:36] Speaker_D | Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page ."
[03:56] Speaker_B | You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel .
[04:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[04:15] Speaker_D | Okay .
[04:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:29] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
[04:40] Speaker_B | Oh yeah ?
[04:50] Speaker_A | So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .
[04:57] Speaker_C | I think if you look at
"[04:59] Speaker_C | most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those ."
[05:02] Speaker_A | That's right .
[05:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:14] Speaker_C | The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
[05:26] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
[05:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
[05:54] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
"[05:56] Speaker_C | Well , you can't"
[05:59] Speaker_C | leave out the number buttons I guess .
[06:01] Speaker_A | Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay .
[06:04] Speaker_C | Yeah . So it's rather basic already .
[06:04] Speaker_B | Oh .
[06:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .
[06:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:15] Speaker_A | Yep .
[06:17] Speaker_A | Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?
"[06:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition ."
[06:24] Speaker_A | Just n normal plain buttons .
[06:36] Speaker_A | Yeah . 'Kay .
[06:42] Speaker_A | No .
[06:47] Speaker_A | No .
[06:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
[06:54] Speaker_C | So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out .
[06:57] Speaker_B | Nay .
[06:58] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[07:05] Speaker_A | Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you"
[07:05] Speaker_C | And uh that's about it .
[07:24] Speaker_A | that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
[07:33] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[07:34] Speaker_A | If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible ."
[07:45] Speaker_D | Since it rechargeable .
[07:46] Speaker_A | It's rechargeable . That's right .
[07:51] Speaker_A | Okay . That's two Euros off . We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh
[07:57] Speaker_C | Yep .
[08:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[08:15] Speaker_A | I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that ."
[08:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:25] Speaker_C | Yes .
[08:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:28] Speaker_A | Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
"[08:42] Speaker_A | So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,"
[08:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
[08:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:00] Speaker_A | so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros ."
"[09:04] Speaker_B | Sixteen , I believe so ."
"[09:16] Speaker_A | So ,"
[09:16] Speaker_B | Uh seventeen .
[09:18] Speaker_A | seventeen .
[09:19] Speaker_B | Uh with the help button .
[09:22] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[09:22] Speaker_A | Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button"
[09:22] Speaker_D | Damn .
[09:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:30] Speaker_A | uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number"
[09:37] Speaker_C | Yep .
[09:37] Speaker_A | long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
[09:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:44] Speaker_D | Wouldn't Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .
[09:45] Speaker_A | Fifteen buttons .
"[09:49] Speaker_D | Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?"
"[09:54] Speaker_A | No those are one , I think ."
[09:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:57] Speaker_D | Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ?"
"[10:14] Speaker_A | Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing"
[10:16] Speaker_B | It's just a .
"[10:24] Speaker_D | Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button ."
[10:30] Speaker_A | That's possibility as well .
[10:32] Speaker_D | That would cut the cost .
[11:10] Speaker_A | Plus . Min .
[11:17] Speaker_A | Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w
[11:24] Speaker_A | Yeah th I think they count uh the materials .
[11:32] Speaker_A | Yeah on the chip there . Yeah .
[11:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[11:36] Speaker_A | That's right . That's right .
[11:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:45] Speaker_D | But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow ."
[11:49] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[11:51] Speaker_A | Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t"
[12:01] Speaker_D | Yes .
[12:03] Speaker_C | Uh that's that's a big cost .
[12:11] Speaker_C | If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
"[12:25] Speaker_D | Only the docking station , I guess ."
[12:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:29] Speaker_C | Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
[12:35] Speaker_A | No . That's extra . That's extra . That's right .
[12:35] Speaker_C | So it's not even taken into the price .
[12:40] Speaker_D | Maybe we should to a different supplier .
[13:11] Speaker_C | My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .
[13:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's a point .
[13:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:36] Speaker_A | Yep .
[13:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:39] Speaker_A | No .
"[13:41] Speaker_D | Well , since the market research"
"[13:44] Speaker_D | indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features ."
[13:55] Speaker_B | Nay .
[14:05] Speaker_C | The margin will get too small . Yeah .
[14:09] Speaker_B | But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
[14:14] Speaker_B | I don't think so .
[14:14] Speaker_A | It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons .
[14:15] Speaker_D | It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
[14:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:23] Speaker_A | Say Or you can take the single chip .
[14:24] Speaker_C | Ten .
[14:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:35] Speaker_B | But we want to make a
[14:37] Speaker_A | But then w
[14:43] Speaker_A | Good looking .
"[14:43] Speaker_B | Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh"
[14:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:56] Speaker_D | Or b
"[14:57] Speaker_D | Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control ."
[15:09] Speaker_A | Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
[15:17] Speaker_B | Scroll-wheel's one .
[15:17] Speaker_A | Then w
[15:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:34] Speaker_C | We're getting closer .
[15:38] Speaker_D | But how does scroll-wheel work here ?
[15:48] Speaker_A | Or maybe you can
"[15:51] Speaker_A | um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it ."
[15:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:01] Speaker_D | That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also .
[16:05] Speaker_A | Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
[16:05] Speaker_D | Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But Yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
[16:13] Speaker_C | You could just not scroll for a half a second .
"[16:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel ."
[16:17] Speaker_C | So you won't need a button .
[16:22] Speaker_D | I think that would be like the end of our usability .
[16:41] Speaker_A | And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?
"[16:46] Speaker_C | If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes ."
[16:48] Speaker_A | It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
[16:50] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[16:59] Speaker_A | That's an option we can Then we're almost there .
[17:01] Speaker_C | Yep .
[17:01] Speaker_B | Ja ja .
[17:06] Speaker_C | Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
"[17:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button ."
[17:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:23] Speaker_A | Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
[17:28] Speaker_C | I think so . Yeah .
"[17:28] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah ."
[17:29] Speaker_A | If you push it three times ?
"[17:29] Speaker_D | Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there ."
[17:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:48] Speaker_B | One m uh one b uh , a few buttons ."
"[17:49] Speaker_D | Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click ."
[17:54] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
"[17:56] Speaker_D | But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is ."
[18:02] Speaker_C | No .
[18:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:05] Speaker_D | Holding a
[18:05] Speaker_A | No .
[18:07] Speaker_D | remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
[18:16] Speaker_D | With only five buttons on it .
[18:19] Speaker_D | And a scroll-wheel .
"[18:21] Speaker_A | I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel ."
[18:35] Speaker_A | If you just make it real simple .
"[18:40] Speaker_A | Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles ."
[18:48] Speaker_D | True . True .
[18:50] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[18:53] Speaker_A | And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these .
[19:02] Speaker_A | Mm eraser ?
[19:29] Speaker_D | That's a pretty big scroll wheel .
"[19:50] Speaker_A | Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one ."
[20:14] Speaker_A | And these are two buttons then .
[20:34] Speaker_C | If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
[20:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:39] Speaker_C | So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .
[20:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:43] Speaker_A | That's really a good good idea , I think ."
[20:51] Speaker_A | And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .
[20:55] Speaker_C | More obvious .
"[20:59] Speaker_A | So we make one for the volume , one for the channel ."
"[21:11] Speaker_A | Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want ."
[21:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:23] Speaker_A | That's m that's better .
[21:24] Speaker_D | So this is five buttons .
"[21:25] Speaker_C | If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall ."
"[21:34] Speaker_C | So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button"
[21:35] Speaker_A | Y yeah .
[21:41] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[21:45] Speaker_C | you get a a much smaller remote .
[21:47] Speaker_B | Uh yeah .
[21:48] Speaker_A | That's right .
[21:50] Speaker_C | And it
[21:51] Speaker_A | So we can
[21:53] Speaker_A | decrease this one to four buttons .
[21:56] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
[21:57] Speaker_D | Right now we have five .
[22:06] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's no problem .
[22:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:13] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one ."
[22:19] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[22:30] Speaker_A | I think this is a really easy one . Um ,"
"[22:35] Speaker_A | what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?"
[22:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:49] Speaker_C | Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .
[22:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:50] Speaker_D | all these changes are not really okay with me . But since
[22:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:53] Speaker_A | Yep .
[22:56] Speaker_A | We have to cut costs . Yeah . Yeah I'm ag
[22:57] Speaker_D | we just have to .
[22:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:00] Speaker_D | I'd rather just go to the board and
[23:04] Speaker_A | Ask for more money .
[23:04] Speaker_D | get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .
[23:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .
[23:09] Speaker_D | Or do some market research and see what the options are .
"[23:13] Speaker_A | Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well ."
[23:23] Speaker_C | Yep .
[23:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:43] Speaker_A | So this is scroll .
[23:56] Speaker_A | I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design .
[24:01] Speaker_B | The th
[24:06] Speaker_A | I'm glad we could make a bit .
[24:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:11] Speaker_A | It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one ."
[24:18] Speaker_B | No .
[24:22] Speaker_A | Yeah . It will .
[24:22] Speaker_D | to get this to sell .
[24:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:27] Speaker_D | 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .
[24:35] Speaker_D | So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
"[24:45] Speaker_A | That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one ."
[24:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:51] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[24:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:58] Speaker_A | So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see ."
[25:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:13] Speaker_D | That's true . Might uh might be confusing too .
[25:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's definitely right .
"[25:16] Speaker_D | They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?"
[25:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:28] Speaker_A | That's right . I would buy it if I was six . No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ?
"[25:37] Speaker_A | Uh , yes they are ."
[25:40] Speaker_A | No . But we can go on with the project evaluation .
[25:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[25:49] Speaker_A | Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule ."
[25:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:57] Speaker_A | Um , the project process ."
"[26:00] Speaker_D | So um , I like set up all these criteria ."
[26:04] Speaker_A | Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot .
[26:04] Speaker_D | And evaluation of the
[26:08] Speaker_D | thingy .
[26:22] Speaker_D | Five more minutes ?
[26:25] Speaker_D | Okay .
[26:36] Speaker_A | Uh yes . What ?
"[26:42] Speaker_D | 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier ."
[26:48] Speaker_A | Uh yeah .
"[26:49] Speaker_D | Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ?"
"[27:03] Speaker_D | Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost ."
[27:20] Speaker_D | The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
[27:38] Speaker_D | So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .
[27:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[27:44] Speaker_D | Let's see .
"[27:47] Speaker_D | Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting"
[27:53] Speaker_D | were not here .
"[27:53] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software ."
[27:54] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:57] Speaker_D | Okay .
[27:59] Speaker_D | Interesting .
[28:04] Speaker_B | Mm . 'Kay .
"[28:07] Speaker_D | Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?"
[28:10] Speaker_A | I think it's fancy .
[28:12] Speaker_C | Six .
[28:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:14] Speaker_B | Uh six . Yeah .
[28:14] Speaker_D | We all go for six ? Good .
[28:15] Speaker_A | Six .
"[28:20] Speaker_D | Um , is the design innovative ?"
[28:24] Speaker_B | Mm . Sh
"[28:24] Speaker_D | I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons ."
[28:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:30] Speaker_D | Seven ?
[28:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's right .
[28:42] Speaker_B | Mm . Not really .
[28:43] Speaker_A | That's a bit dodgy .
[28:50] Speaker_A | I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
[28:51] Speaker_C | Four or five . Yes .
[28:52] Speaker_B | W Yeah . Four .
"[28:55] Speaker_D | I'd go for four , too ."
[28:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:01] Speaker_A | Is it functional ?
"[29:02] Speaker_D | Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?"
[29:07] Speaker_A | Yes .
[29:08] Speaker_B | N Yeah .
[29:08] Speaker_D | I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim .
[29:10] Speaker_C | No .
[29:11] Speaker_B | No .
[29:11] Speaker_A | No .
[29:12] Speaker_A | Think it's uh seven .

[29:58] Speaker_C | I think that's a three .
"[29:58] Speaker_B | Mm , th yeah ."
"[30:00] Speaker_A | No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh"
[30:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:05] Speaker_A | I think it's better .
[30:08] Speaker_D | I don't know .
[30:14] Speaker_D | I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
"[30:20] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah , true ."
[30:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:23] Speaker_A | I would give it a four .

[30:35] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[30:43] Speaker_D | Is the company company recognisable ? Well , we have the logo there ."

[31:36] Speaker_D | something . Two ?
[31:39] Speaker_D | No . Nine ?
"[31:42] Speaker_D | Uh , minus one ."
[31:50] Speaker_D | Minus four .
[31:53] Speaker_D | So that would be minus eight .
[31:56] Speaker_D | Forty one out of forty nine .
[31:56] Speaker_A | Forty one .
[32:05] Speaker_A | Around eighty percent . What is it ?
[32:06] Speaker_D | Okay .

[33:12] Speaker_A | That's right .
[33:13] Speaker_D | In the design phase .

[37:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[37:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[37:48] Speaker_A | How do we call ?
[38:04] Speaker_A | criteria .
[38:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[38:16] Speaker_A | Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?"
[38:24] Speaker_B | Mm .
[38:28] Speaker_A | Because I think
[38:34] Speaker_A | then that we get to our last sheet .
[38:40] Speaker_A | Are the costs within the budget ?
[38:43] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[38:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[38:44] Speaker_D | They are .
[38:50] Speaker_A | Docking station . That's a good point . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
[39:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[39:01] Speaker_C | Perhaps .
[39:01] Speaker_A | Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .
[39:04] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[39:05] Speaker_A | So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well ."
[39:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[39:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[39:11] Speaker_A | Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent .
[39:16] Speaker_D | Fifty grand .
[39:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[39:29] Speaker_B | Yeah . Mm .
[39:31] Speaker_A | Sometimes .
"[39:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway"
[39:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[39:37] Speaker_A | You can do more .
[39:38] Speaker_D | it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus .
[39:41] Speaker_B | Ah .
[39:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[39:45] Speaker_A | Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .
[39:47] Speaker_D | Or specifically for younger people .
[39:47] Speaker_B | Ah .
[39:53] Speaker_B | Ah .
[39:54] Speaker_D | That's true .
"[40:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with"
[40:19] Speaker_D | older people .
[40:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[40:21] Speaker_D | Even if it were their covers .
[40:23] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[40:23] Speaker_A | Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now ."
[40:30] Speaker_A | That's it . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . I don't know . I didn't get a message

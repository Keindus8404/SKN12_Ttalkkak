"[03:29] Speaker_A | Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder ,"
"[04:05] Speaker_A | which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well"
[04:24] Speaker_A | I'd say let's start with the first presentation . Um in the same order as last time ? Okay .
[04:26] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[04:29] Speaker_C | W sure .
[04:30] Speaker_B | Mm . Alright .
"[04:32] Speaker_A | Well , take it away ."
"[04:59] Speaker_C | uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls ."
"[05:10] Speaker_C | Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about ."
[05:31] Speaker_D | Don't destroy my giraffe .
[05:46] Speaker_D | Drop it .
[05:47] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[06:02] Speaker_C | for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material ."
"[06:38] Speaker_C | Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green ."
[06:54] Speaker_C | New . Blank .
[06:57] Speaker_D | You have to go t
[06:57] Speaker_C | Okay .
[07:00] Speaker_C | Let's make it uh black .
[07:03] Speaker_C | Okay . I thought of an idea like this .
[07:06] Speaker_C | Oh that . Um delete .
[07:12] Speaker_C | Blank . Okay .
"[07:20] Speaker_C | So it also looks nice when it's on your table . So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands ."
[07:28] Speaker_D | Oh it's a side view .
"[07:29] Speaker_C | Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , but . Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too ."
[07:54] Speaker_C | One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . So uh
[08:20] Speaker_D | True .
"[08:25] Speaker_C | uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions , ? Okay ."
[08:44] Speaker_D | No no no no no . Just looking .
"[08:47] Speaker_C | And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side ."
"[09:32] Speaker_C | Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ? Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber ."
[09:43] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[09:48] Speaker_A | Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,"
"[09:53] Speaker_C | Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ?"
[09:58] Speaker_C | Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ?
[10:02] Speaker_A | It must be recognisable .
"[10:03] Speaker_C | Okay okay . Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people"
"[10:28] Speaker_C | in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium ."
"[11:00] Speaker_C | And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . Okay . Well that's all about my uh my findings ."
[11:13] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[11:14] Speaker_A | Okay , thank you ."
[11:15] Speaker_D | Mm mm mm . Next .
[11:15] Speaker_B | I will go next .
"[11:29] Speaker_B | Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of ."
"[11:49] Speaker_B | Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer ."
[12:13] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:27] Speaker_B | Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . And perhaps we could uh implement that . And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw , so uh don't make too much of it ."
[12:27] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:28] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:30] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:36] Speaker_D | It's true .
"[12:53] Speaker_B | I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but yeah . So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon ."
[13:04] Speaker_C | Not just a P_ . Oh okay .
"[13:05] Speaker_D | P_ yeah , just a P_ ."
[13:07] Speaker_C | .. .
[13:15] Speaker_D | Where's where's the button for two ?
[13:16] Speaker_B | Um .
"[13:19] Speaker_B | I forgot that one . I thought I forgot something , but uh . And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . So could call it settings or something . But this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,"
[13:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:29] Speaker_C | Ah .
[13:30] Speaker_D | Doesn't matter .
[13:40] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[13:40] Speaker_D | No .
[13:43] Speaker_C | Yep .
[13:57] Speaker_B | so that it's better in your hand or something uh . But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .
"[13:59] Speaker_C | Oh okay , yeah ."
"[14:06] Speaker_B | Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of"
"[14:14] Speaker_B | and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things ."
"[14:20] Speaker_C | Oh yeah , ."
[14:47] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:49] Speaker_C | Mm .
[14:52] Speaker_C | Okay .
[14:53] Speaker_B | That's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge .
[15:00] Speaker_A | Thanks .
[15:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:03] Speaker_A | Now our third
[15:07] Speaker_A | team member with his presentation .
"[15:22] Speaker_D | Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours ,"
[15:33] Speaker_D | material and stuff .
[15:35] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[15:40] Speaker_D | Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy ."
"[16:02] Speaker_D | The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use ."
"[16:23] Speaker_D | The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff ."
"[16:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . Like that . The round shapes ,"
[16:36] Speaker_D | and soft material m materials like the rubber . It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . Th
[16:39] Speaker_C | Mm . Okay .
"[16:46] Speaker_D | Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges ."
"[17:02] Speaker_D | And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours ,"
"[17:14] Speaker_D | innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like"
[17:29] Speaker_D | this or something .
"[17:31] Speaker_D | It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something . And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? Different colours , yeah . We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but"
"[17:45] Speaker_B | It was one remote , I think , different colours ."
[18:03] Speaker_D | easy to use . So that's it .
[18:05] Speaker_C | Mm .
[18:07] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[18:07] Speaker_A | So for the older people , a more traditional uh form ."
"[18:14] Speaker_B | You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , but ."
[18:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh"
[18:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:24] Speaker_C | Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?
[18:25] Speaker_A | the shape of it .
"[18:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah ."
[18:32] Speaker_A | But maybe then both groups won't buy it .
[18:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:35] Speaker_B | Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ?"
[18:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:58] Speaker_B | So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh"
[19:01] Speaker_B | round .
[19:01] Speaker_C | Kinda like a beer glass . Yeah .
[19:05] Speaker_C | I know what you mean .
[19:10] Speaker_C | It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand .
[19:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:20] Speaker_C | Will recognise that's as a remote control . Uh when I saw your d Oh .
[19:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:25] Speaker_D | Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . They liked the wood a lot . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things ."
[19:31] Speaker_C | Huh .
[19:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[19:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:45] Speaker_D | Those kind of Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . And the old people , old and boring ."
[19:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:53] Speaker_B | But that's easily to do with the colour , I think ."
"[19:55] Speaker_D | So Sorry ? Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes ."
"[19:56] Speaker_B | That's easy to do with the colours , I think ."
[20:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:00] Speaker_C | Uh .
[20:00] Speaker_A | Yeah we think so too .
"[20:07] Speaker_D | In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . So we have to decide if we're going to use"
[20:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:21] Speaker_D | real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that ."
[20:26] Speaker_C | Soft rubber .
[20:27] Speaker_D | Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it .
[20:30] Speaker_C | Yeah I know what you Um .
"[20:33] Speaker_D | Or No . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder ."
[20:34] Speaker_C | It should shouldn't be .
[20:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:45] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[20:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , something like this , yeah ."
"[20:51] Speaker_B | But it's quite hard , this ."
[20:53] Speaker_D | Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . It's feels kind s spongy .
[20:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:57] Speaker_C | Spongy .
[20:59] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[21:02] Speaker_D | No .
[21:05] Speaker_D | N n n
[21:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:13] Speaker_B | So we should first decide about shape , I think . Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh ."
[21:13] Speaker_C | Ding ding .
[21:23] Speaker_C | Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .
[21:36] Speaker_B | Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah .
[21:36] Speaker_C | .. .
"[21:38] Speaker_C | This was your size , but I think it should be larger ."
"[21:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your oh ."
"[21:49] Speaker_C | Uh new , blank ."
[22:04] Speaker_C | Uh kinda like this .
[22:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[22:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:06] Speaker_C | Or should it be larger ? Larger ? Because you want to put your hands You want
[22:08] Speaker_D | Larger I think .
[22:15] Speaker_C | Yeah . Your thumb here .
"[22:15] Speaker_D | Yeah okay , true , true , true true ."
[22:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:25] Speaker_C | Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff ."
"[22:33] Speaker_B | You always touch it , yeah ."
[22:34] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
[22:37] Speaker_D | But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .
[22:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:47] Speaker_D | You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .
"[22:58] Speaker_D | Yeah true , but Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ?"
"[23:01] Speaker_C | Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button ."
[23:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:09] Speaker_A | Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , right ?"
[23:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:12] Speaker_D | No . Yeah .
[23:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:15] Speaker_B | Y you could include a pen .
[23:16] Speaker_D | Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen .
"[23:20] Speaker_D | Yeah the fingers , yeah ."
"[23:20] Speaker_B | Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen ."
"[23:26] Speaker_B | Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something ."
[23:37] Speaker_C | Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth .
"[23:41] Speaker_A | Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision ."
[23:49] Speaker_C | Sure .
[23:50] Speaker_A | So we can discuss these points .
"[23:57] Speaker_A | energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them ."
[24:15] Speaker_B | I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah .
[24:18] Speaker_C | The docking station .
[24:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . So that's the the the first point . We already decided that on the previous meeting .
[24:21] Speaker_D | Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .
[24:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . Just like with the telephone .
[24:28] Speaker_D | So if the badg the batteries are dead
[24:29] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:31] Speaker_D | then you can re you can uh change them .
[24:33] Speaker_C | Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse .
[24:39] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah like those .
[24:42] Speaker_C | Kinda like those kind of batteries .
[24:43] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[24:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah ."
[24:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:51] Speaker_A | Simple rechargeable uh batteries .
[24:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:58] Speaker_B | Um what was with the chip on print ?
[25:09] Speaker_D | Print plate .
[25:16] Speaker_A | Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?
[25:20] Speaker_A | You still have a
[25:23] Speaker_A | print plate .
[25:24] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate .
[25:27] Speaker_C | Beg your pardon ?
"[25:29] Speaker_C | Yeah sure , of course , yeah ."
[25:29] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[25:32] Speaker_D | I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .
[25:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[25:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[25:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:07] Speaker_D | Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think ."
[26:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[26:17] Speaker_A | Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess ."
[26:19] Speaker_C | I suppose so .
"[26:23] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ ."
[26:28] Speaker_C | Yeah because it has to uh b
[26:33] Speaker_C | Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .
"[26:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , true true ."
[26:43] Speaker_D | True .
[26:45] Speaker_C | So it has to have some kind of a
[26:49] Speaker_C | calculation unit or C_P_U_
[26:52] Speaker_C | to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .
[26:57] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .
[27:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:11] Speaker_B | It's rubber . Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber or Yeah .
[27:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:19] Speaker_B | It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . Yeah yeah this in different colours ?
"[27:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah sure , look ."
[27:22] Speaker_D | We have different colours .
[27:25] Speaker_D | So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?
"[27:33] Speaker_D | No I don't think , I think"
"[27:38] Speaker_B | Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps ."
[27:40] Speaker_D | So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people .
[27:44] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think so too .
"[27:44] Speaker_A | Yeah . But that's what we want , ."
"[27:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's our target . Yeah ."
[27:47] Speaker_C | It's our main target .
[27:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[27:49] Speaker_D | Lower than forty years , I think"
[27:53] Speaker_D | it was .
[27:53] Speaker_C | Well and how about my idea uh of making it um
[27:57] Speaker_C | with one single curve ?
[28:00] Speaker_D | Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good
[28:00] Speaker_C | So i
[28:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:04] Speaker_C | Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course ."
[28:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:08] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[28:09] Speaker_D | You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . Yeah ."
[28:09] Speaker_C | Because it Yeah .
[28:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's a good idea ."
[28:17] Speaker_C | It's a lot easier .
"[28:18] Speaker_B | Yeah , alright ."
"[28:21] Speaker_C | So , so you got uh Did you write that down ? Uh got a single curved uh rubber"
"[28:29] Speaker_D | You can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the"
[28:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:39] Speaker_D | And load it on the the user the server .
"[28:46] Speaker_A | What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . You you showed your drawing ."
"[28:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , I had what I just uh I should again ."
"[29:00] Speaker_B | I miss a few buttons , but ."
[29:04] Speaker_B | Well .
"[29:07] Speaker_B | At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh"
[29:14] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[29:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , you have to go back ."
[29:18] Speaker_D | Yeah uh uh .
[29:20] Speaker_D | Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?
[29:28] Speaker_D | With the minus and the plus . I think it's
"[29:31] Speaker_B | I don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think ."
[29:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:39] Speaker_B | Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?
[29:39] Speaker_A | Mm .
[29:43] Speaker_D | For sound and channel .
"[29:50] Speaker_B | Right well if we make it like this , I think if you"
[29:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:55] Speaker_C | Square .
"[30:03] Speaker_D | Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here ."
"[30:09] Speaker_D | A minus here , plus over here ."
[30:13] Speaker_D | And on here .
[30:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:15] Speaker_D | The other buttons and on here the top .
"[30:19] Speaker_D | The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here ,"
[30:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . But I think I wou
[30:26] Speaker_D | and the sound .
[30:33] Speaker_B | I think that's a matter of what you're used to . I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .
[31:06] Speaker_D | minus .
"[31:07] Speaker_B | Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus ."
[31:14] Speaker_D | Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb .
[31:26] Speaker_B | That's me . But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . The 'Cause they can use that better . Yeah .
[31:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:35] Speaker_C | Consistency .
[31:36] Speaker_D | Oh I have that those s numbers .
[31:40] Speaker_B | Here is our here are uh
[31:43] Speaker_D | Or a good watch . B
[31:44] Speaker_B | I don't really know .
[31:46] Speaker_A | Everybody's searching in his data .
[31:48] Speaker_D | Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour
[31:55] Speaker_B | Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .
[32:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[32:04] Speaker_B | W what's what's usual or normal . Yes I'm looking here . But here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other ."
"[32:04] Speaker_D | Yeah , that depends on on on the remote ."
[32:09] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[32:17] Speaker_D | I think because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends ."
[32:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:24] Speaker_D | Yeah . Depends .
[32:26] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[32:31] Speaker_B | I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back ."
"[32:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , lower ."
[32:46] Speaker_D | True .
[32:46] Speaker_B | That's how it's is usually when I look here
"[32:51] Speaker_C | Okay , um ."
[32:51] Speaker_B | that's what I see .
[32:58] Speaker_A | Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the
[33:03] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[33:04] Speaker_D | Yeah is it is user interface .
[33:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:07] Speaker_A | concepts .
[33:07] Speaker_D | Component .
"[33:12] Speaker_C | Okay , well le"
[33:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:17] Speaker_C | Interface , yeah ."
"[33:22] Speaker_A | Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?"
"[33:24] Speaker_D | Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here ."
"[33:25] Speaker_C | Technologies , uh ."
[33:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner . Yeah .
[33:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:35] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[33:36] Speaker_D | Yeah , a microphone , yeah ."
[33:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:47] Speaker_A | Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
"[33:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's also ."
[33:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:53] Speaker_C | Right .
[33:53] Speaker_A | over there .
"[33:54] Speaker_B | So , in the middle or something ."
"[33:54] Speaker_C | But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is ."
"[33:55] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[34:02] Speaker_C | Ah okay , sure , okay , well tha"
[34:04] Speaker_D | Um I think where it isn't seen
[34:05] Speaker_C | Underneath ?
[34:09] Speaker_D | the most .
[34:12] Speaker_D | Inside .
[34:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
"[34:15] Speaker_C | Yeah sure , why no"
[34:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[34:19] Speaker_A | because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control ."
[34:27] Speaker_B | Yeah . So where do you want to put it ?
"[34:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[34:32] Speaker_B | Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it .
[34:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:40] Speaker_C | Uh .
[34:41] Speaker_B | So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .
"[34:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[34:44] Speaker_A | But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote ."
"[34:46] Speaker_B | About a microphone , there is no button ."
[34:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:57] Speaker_D | I think the left s under corner should be the best .
[35:04] Speaker_D | Where isn't i it isn't most in sight .
[35:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:09] Speaker_C | Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . That doesn't doesn't really matter .
[35:09] Speaker_D | I think .
[35:15] Speaker_D | No . Actually doesn't .
[35:18] Speaker_C | Okay . So ?
[35:19] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[35:21] Speaker_A | So well uh type , supplements ,"
[35:25] Speaker_C | Interface type .
"[35:28] Speaker_C | The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah ."
[35:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:52] Speaker_B | Um yeah . Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah .
"[35:56] Speaker_C | Use the scroll . Yeah I think so too . So why not , on on side ."
[35:57] Speaker_D | Yeah ? You do like it ?
"[36:09] Speaker_C | Fast , yeah ."
[36:16] Speaker_B | But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something .
"[36:17] Speaker_C | You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use ."
[36:26] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[36:30] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
"[36:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , true ."
[36:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .

"[37:53] Speaker_D | Green , wood , brown . Yeah ."
[38:00] Speaker_D | True .
"[38:01] Speaker_C | When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine ."
[38:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[38:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .

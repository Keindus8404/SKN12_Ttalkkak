[00:03] Speaker_A | Hello again .
[00:04] Speaker_B | Hello .
"[00:05] Speaker_D | Hey , Project Manager ."
"[00:07] Speaker_B | Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . I have a little problems with my laptop . And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete ."
[00:08] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[00:12] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[00:27] Speaker_D | What was it , problem ?"
[00:31] Speaker_D | The laptop ?
[00:33] Speaker_D | It hang hung .
[00:36] Speaker_D | Ha-ha .
[00:37] Speaker_D | Oh .
[00:40] Speaker_D | Project Manager .
[00:44] Speaker_D | You're our Project Manager .
[00:44] Speaker_A | Yes .
[00:50] Speaker_A | Welcome to the conceptual design meeting
[00:54] Speaker_A | for Real Reaction .
"[01:26] Speaker_B | During lunch , yeah ."
[01:29] Speaker_D | Master .
"[01:33] Speaker_A | The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our from uh are of two sorts . Components concepts and user interface concepts . Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh Well , we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . Uh how how about the energy ? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . So uh where to put what button ."
"[02:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , sure ."
[02:27] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[02:33] Speaker_C | Uh , let me see . I think it's this one ."
[02:43] Speaker_C | Ha .
[02:45] Speaker_B | Wow .
"[02:47] Speaker_C | Right . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components ."
[03:01] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[03:24] Speaker_C | Ye Ah , it's it's okay . Uh They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . Wood and chrome . And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials ."
"[03:45] Speaker_C | Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh , shapes are curved and round . Y y you get the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs Yes ."
[04:02] Speaker_A | One one little question . Um about the the material . Uh a soft material for a remote control ?
[04:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:09] Speaker_C | No , I'll I'll get to that . You you'll see . Yeah ."
"[04:13] Speaker_C | Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy ."
[04:20] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[04:40] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[04:42] Speaker_D | Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ?"
"[04:46] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . Well , y you could just go for a battery . Or you can go for both ?"
[04:52] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[04:56] Speaker_B | Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?"
"[04:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably . Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something ."
[05:08] Speaker_B | W nah .
[05:11] Speaker_B | Mm .
[05:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:15] Speaker_C | Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface ."
[05:31] Speaker_D | Mm yeah . It's too less space .
[05:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:33] Speaker_C | So uh so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light ."
[05:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:51] Speaker_B | Okay .
[05:55] Speaker_A | But you prefer kinetic ?
[05:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much ."
"[06:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , well uh actually it is . And it it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery ."
[06:17] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:38] Speaker_C | And so that Uh Uh well , f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring ."
"[06:56] Speaker_C | So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . That gives you an whole new uh effec"
[07:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:12] Speaker_A | Dynamic dynamic look ?
[07:12] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[07:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later ."
"[07:20] Speaker_D | But , are you going to draw it ?"
[07:23] Speaker_C | What ?
[07:24] Speaker_D | The Yeah .
[07:24] Speaker_B | Th th yeah . Yeah .
[07:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[07:28] Speaker_D | Uh , I c I can't imagine ."
[07:31] Speaker_D | I can't imagine how how how it looks like .
[07:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:43] Speaker_D | Design .
[07:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:49] Speaker_C | That's a bit your d standard design . But you could actually go like uh something like this .
[07:51] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[08:16] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
[08:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[08:22] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
[08:22] Speaker_A | A little artistic .
"[08:24] Speaker_C | Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity . Uh that might be an idea , but just a Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah ."
[08:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:28] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:41] Speaker_A | It's soft .
"[08:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's soft and it's that I like soft . Yeah , yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . Uh that's maybe just me , but Uh , we could uh"
"[09:01] Speaker_C | uh , oh , talk about it later . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ ."
"[09:14] Speaker_C | And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it ."
"[09:33] Speaker_C | So that's something we th have to keep in mind . If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons ."
"[09:41] Speaker_D | Well , I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them ."
[09:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , probably ."
"[09:57] Speaker_D | U usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar ."
"[10:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , probably , but But uh yeah , that's that's That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?"
"[10:19] Speaker_B | Um , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up ."
"[10:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , you you you should we should A combination . Uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up ."
"[10:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , a combination ."
"[10:25] Speaker_B | A combination , yeah ."
[10:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[10:33] Speaker_D | Acu uh , yeah . Well , . Yeah ."
"[10:34] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah , I know ."
[10:35] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[10:35] Speaker_A | Just like the watch from Seiko .
[10:38] Speaker_B | Psycho-kinetic . Yeah .
"[10:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , I con Exactly . What uh what do you think ? You agree ?"
[10:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:41] Speaker_A | I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .
[10:45] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Both ?
[10:45] Speaker_D | Combine them .
[10:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . Combine them .
[11:07] Speaker_B | Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that .
[11:15] Speaker_D | Rubber .
[11:16] Speaker_A | Rubber . Yeah .
"[11:17] Speaker_B | Um , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . Or do you think it Rubber casing , yeah ."
[11:27] Speaker_D | Rather hard .
[11:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:40] Speaker_B | Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . Uh , is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ?"
[11:41] Speaker_C | I I I would choose rubber .
"[11:52] Speaker_C | Well , m I don't know . No ."
"[11:53] Speaker_D | Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . Hmm ?"
[11:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:05] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[12:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[12:13] Speaker_C | Yeah , that would cover it . That that would solve the problem ."
"[12:15] Speaker_B | Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it ."
[12:17] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[12:18] Speaker_C | So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . Yeah , you too ? You sure ? You you you seemed to hesitate a bit ."
"[12:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , me too ."
[12:24] Speaker_A | Me too . Yeah ?
[12:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[12:26] Speaker_B | That's good . Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh it's not bendable or something , I th I think that goes too far ."
[12:31] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
[12:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:46] Speaker_B | It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . Okay .
[13:03] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[13:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:07] Speaker_A | Thank you .
"[13:08] Speaker_C | Uh , you're welcome ."
"[13:11] Speaker_A | Yeah . Do your thing , Tim ."
[13:27] Speaker_D | Last week
[13:30] Speaker_D | I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .
[13:36] Speaker_D | For marketing .
"[13:39] Speaker_D | Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays ."
"[14:06] Speaker_D | Findings . Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . At first , the colours of fruit ."
"[14:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . They like spongy material , like yeah a sponge-ball . Like a s soft material . Janus m uh mentioned it also . I think he did some uh"
[14:38] Speaker_B | Spongeball .
[14:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:48] Speaker_D | some findings himself . You wer you weren't in Paris ? Okay . Like this .
"[14:56] Speaker_D | Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . It's nice , I think ."
[14:58] Speaker_A | Flashy .
[15:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of ."
[15:24] Speaker_D | No n j just j just a w
"[15:28] Speaker_D | No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look ."
"[15:30] Speaker_A | Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah ."
[15:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:32] Speaker_D | Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . The that isn't wood anyway , but Okay ?"
[15:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:47] Speaker_D | mm yeah the people below forty . So , that this doesn't apply ."
[15:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:52] Speaker_D | 'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy ."
"[16:00] Speaker_D | Um , they should be technological in innovative ."
"[16:05] Speaker_D | That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common ."
[16:14] Speaker_D | My personal preferences .
"[16:17] Speaker_D | We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours ."
"[16:28] Speaker_D | Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one ."
[16:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[17:04] Speaker_D | Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh"
[17:15] Speaker_D | seen on regular mobile phones .
"[17:22] Speaker_C | Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah ."
[17:25] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
[17:25] Speaker_B | Ah .
[17:26] Speaker_A | Maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
"[17:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly . Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative ."
"[17:44] Speaker_A | So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh Okay ."
"[18:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think ."
"[18:18] Speaker_D | No , but No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . It's just the same ."
"[18:18] Speaker_C | Well , yeah ."
"[18:24] Speaker_B | When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else ."
[18:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[19:04] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[19:33] Speaker_B | Okay . Um the interface contents .
"[19:38] Speaker_B | Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen ."
"[19:50] Speaker_B | Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible ."
"[19:56] Speaker_B | Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to um"
"[20:18] Speaker_B | t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . And um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in"
[20:48] Speaker_B | inside your hands . And some remotes you can use with your thumb . But I think that's too difficult for this one . So you can make it s a little broader .
[20:57] Speaker_B | Yeah . And here ? And maybe use your thumb
[21:02] Speaker_B | on the on the main buttons . And use your other hands
"[21:06] Speaker_B | on the menu structure . So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two , three , four , et cetera ."
[21:14] Speaker_B | And the the volume control and program control maybe .
"[21:18] Speaker_B | And , down here ,"
"[21:21] Speaker_B | um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure ."
[21:29] Speaker_B | So you can use it in uh in this way .
"[21:50] Speaker_B | And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . And do not use too many levels . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . But just the um uh just in one button if possible ."
[22:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . Uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? L like in uh internet explorer ."
"[22:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it . Is uh volume plus and minus ? And this is program uh plus"
[23:06] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[23:09] Speaker_B | Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two Well yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . You just don't have to play games uh in-between . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options ."
"[23:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , and on two . That you can switch switch easy ."
[23:20] Speaker_D | Yeah it is .
[23:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:36] Speaker_D | Mm no .
"[23:39] Speaker_B | Um , yeah already already told that ."
[23:45] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's my conclusion .
[23:47] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[23:47] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
[24:05] Speaker_A | There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it .
"[24:18] Speaker_B | Well , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere ."
[24:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:22] Speaker_B | Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control ."
"[24:25] Speaker_D | What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children ."
[24:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:39] Speaker_B | Mm .
[24:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:42] Speaker_B | Um , w well , yeah ."
[24:45] Speaker_B | It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
"[24:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , ok"
[25:05] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:08] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[25:11] Speaker_B | You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . And if you push parents , then Yeah . To log in ."
[25:14] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[25:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . Pu push parents . That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . Like two one three . And it's in .
[25:24] Speaker_B | Yeah . And if you puts a ye
[25:32] Speaker_D | It automatically goes Yeah .
[25:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:51] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:00] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
[26:08] Speaker_D | V violent T_V_ .
[26:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:27] Speaker_B | Well , maybe um some idea on that . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something ."
[26:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[26:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , of course ."
[26:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:48] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
[26:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:51] Speaker_A | That's a that's a better idea ?
[26:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
"[27:05] Speaker_D | If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with ."
"[27:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , with and one without ."
"[27:20] Speaker_B | Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels , because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . I don't know ."
[27:21] Speaker_D | I th Yeah .
[27:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[27:56] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out ."
[28:20] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's true .
[28:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:24] Speaker_D | Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible .
[28:26] Speaker_B | That isn't possible .
[28:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:27] Speaker_C | But , well , if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel ."
[28:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:48] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[28:58] Speaker_C | Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling ."
[29:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:08] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[29:28] Speaker_A | I wouldn't put it in an optional device . That that then then then it becomes too much , I think ."
[29:32] Speaker_C | Yeah ?
"[29:33] Speaker_A | If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise ."
"[29:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , on a separate menu uh option ."
"[29:39] Speaker_D | And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g"
[29:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:51] Speaker_D | go to a channel .
"[29:59] Speaker_C | But , only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . So , you you'd be"
[30:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:09] Speaker_D | Ah it's Yeah . Yeah , okay . But it's just an an added feature feature ."
[30:13] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much .
[30:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:24] Speaker_B | A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh Yeah ."
[30:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:32] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
[30:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:41] Speaker_A | Okay . And games ?
[30:44] Speaker_C | Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah .
[30:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:49] Speaker_D | That that doesn't c that doesn't co
"[30:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think ."
"[30:55] Speaker_A | Okay . So that will uh that that that must be in it , you think ?"
"[31:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , that will be nice ."
[31:01] Speaker_A | Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are
[31:07] Speaker_B | Optional in
[31:08] Speaker_A | optional ?
[31:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:13] Speaker_B | Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem ."
[31:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[31:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:43] Speaker_B | Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . You can put on Yeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something ."
"[31:47] Speaker_D | To put Yeah , to put it in always ."
[31:49] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[31:58] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[32:00] Speaker_C | Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . But it would would be uh more expensive . So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance ."
"[32:24] Speaker_B | Oh , it's a p Yeah ."
"[32:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending ."
[32:29] Speaker_C | Yes they are . Yeah .
[32:30] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[32:31] Speaker_D | I thought they were just
"[32:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , you yo Yeah , but most often not ."
"[32:37] Speaker_C | Yeah . That is true , that is true ."
"[32:38] Speaker_B | Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . And there's just some little uh clock in the remote ."
[32:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:51] Speaker_C | Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . But you still have the problem about uh the television itself ."
"[32:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , j just some rules ."
[32:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[32:58] Speaker_B | No , no , it's very simple . There uh th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . Yeah ?"
"[33:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah yeah ."
"[33:07] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay . But , on the T_V_"
[33:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:14] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[33:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[33:18] Speaker_B | Well , that's To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote ."
[33:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[33:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , of course ."
"[33:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . Yeah , you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem ."
"[33:31] Speaker_B | You have to f Yeah . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic"
[33:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:45] Speaker_B | Okay .
[33:47] Speaker_D | Or j Yeah .
[34:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[34:46] Speaker_A | I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay ."
[34:48] Speaker_D | Consensus .
"[34:51] Speaker_A | Uh , little more ."
"[34:52] Speaker_D | Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . Maybe for uh Jerome . Um , the views ."
[34:52] Speaker_B | Oh .
[34:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:56] Speaker_B | Yeah ? I'm listening .
[35:00] Speaker_D | Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
[35:06] Speaker_A | Like a like a moat or s or something . Yeah .
"[35:08] Speaker_D | Yeah . Like at In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons ."
[35:09] Speaker_C | User profile .
"[35:11] Speaker_B | What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program ."
[35:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept .
"[35:22] Speaker_D | Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah ."
"[35:24] Speaker_C | Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users ."
"[35:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not ."
"[35:31] Speaker_C | Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels ."
[35:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:40] Speaker_D | Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away .
[35:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[35:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that ."
[35:47] Speaker_D | Okay . Go on .
"[35:48] Speaker_C | Ah , yeah , sure ."
[36:20] Speaker_D | Marketing .

[36:44] Speaker_B | Som some bench-marker .
"[36:50] Speaker_A | I uh couldn't uh Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m"

[37:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own .
"[38:07] Speaker_C | Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . And it could just stay there . Yeah , that spins around or something ."

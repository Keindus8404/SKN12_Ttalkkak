[00:01] Speaker_A | Good .
[00:07] Speaker_C | Oh .
[00:08] Speaker_B | What ?
[00:09] Speaker_A | So well uh welcome everyone . Um as you may have noticed I uh
[00:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[00:15] Speaker_A | created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting ."
[00:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[00:31] Speaker_D | That's new one ?
[00:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[00:36] Speaker_A | Then I'll move this one .
[00:37] Speaker_B | Didn't we just do that ?
"[00:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project ."
[00:40] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[00:42] Speaker_A | Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . And we have a evaluation left here . Okay ."
"[00:45] Speaker_C | Oh , okay ."
[00:47] Speaker_C | Hmm hmm .
[00:55] Speaker_C | Agenda .
[00:56] Speaker_A | Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ?
[00:58] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
"[01:07] Speaker_A | We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?"
"[01:16] Speaker_C | Oh , sorry ."
"[01:22] Speaker_A | Aren't you ? Yes , you are . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two ."
[01:26] Speaker_D | Yep . Yep .
[01:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[01:55] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:59] Speaker_C | Get up stand up . just 'Kay .
[02:08] Speaker_C | View .
[02:08] Speaker_B | This is about the total remote control . We made it green .
"[02:13] Speaker_C | Just example colour , so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype ."
[02:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:17] Speaker_B | It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue .
[02:32] Speaker_C | Okay ?
[02:34] Speaker_D | Big microphone .
[02:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:38] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
"[02:41] Speaker_C | Uh well , it's an idea in a so ."
[02:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:48] Speaker_C | Do not forget it .
[02:50] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:51] Speaker_C | To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um
"[02:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay . Of course ."
[02:54] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[02:57] Speaker_D | Mm . Mm , th yeah ."
[03:00] Speaker_D | Small .
"[03:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , you push the scroll button"
"[03:27] Speaker_B | Remote settings , et cetera ."
[03:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[03:43] Speaker_B | Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers ."
"[03:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's c Yeah ."
[03:51] Speaker_C | Indeed .
[03:52] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[03:52] Speaker_C | Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes ."
[04:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[04:19] Speaker_A | So a separate button for for text , okay ."
[04:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .
[04:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[04:31] Speaker_B | Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute ."
"[04:52] Speaker_C | Previous page , yeah , indeed ."
[04:55] Speaker_C | Oh my God .
"[05:10] Speaker_B | Uh battery indicator . It's it's a bit big . And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop ."
[05:20] Speaker_B | Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext .
"[05:23] Speaker_C | Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu ."
[05:40] Speaker_B | Huh .
[05:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[05:51] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well this about it , I think ."
[05:54] Speaker_C | Okay . Huh .
[05:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:57] Speaker_A | Thank you . Looks good .
[05:57] Speaker_B | I will put it back on the on the nice green .
[06:01] Speaker_A | And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ?
[06:11] Speaker_C | Full screen .
[06:13] Speaker_D | Shit .
[06:16] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[06:20] Speaker_A | Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh ?"
"[06:20] Speaker_B | Oh full screen , yeah ."
[06:21] Speaker_C | Huh .
[06:22] Speaker_D | Evaluation .
"[06:25] Speaker_D | 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire"
"[06:31] Speaker_D | by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods ."
"[06:46] Speaker_D | Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps ."
[06:52] Speaker_B | Right .
"[06:59] Speaker_D | One means absolutely not true , seven means true ."
[07:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:05] Speaker_D | The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough ,"
[07:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:17] Speaker_D | is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use ."
[07:23] Speaker_D | And then evaluation itself .
[07:31] Speaker_D | Uh .
[07:32] Speaker_C | What ? Bling .
[07:32] Speaker_D | So .
[07:34] Speaker_D | Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough ?
[07:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:40] Speaker_D | Project Manager , what do you think ?"
"[07:42] Speaker_A | Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ?"
[07:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:51] Speaker_A | Only what happened to the single curve
[07:54] Speaker_A | we spoke about last meeting ?
[07:54] Speaker_B | It uh oh it's in the background . Oh .
[07:59] Speaker_B | Y you should make uh a sideways uh view .
"[08:00] Speaker_C | Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma"
[08:16] Speaker_C | Suppose so .
[08:16] Speaker_D | Think .
[08:18] Speaker_B | Ooh .
"[08:18] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , you can ."
"[08:18] Speaker_C | Ah . Oh my God , it works ."
"[08:19] Speaker_B | So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ?"
"[08:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's the single curve indeed ."
[08:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:29] Speaker_B | So if you v flip it like this .
[08:31] Speaker_C | Yep .
[08:31] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:32] Speaker_B | Here's yeah .
"[08:51] Speaker_B | Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o"
[08:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:55] Speaker_D | Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?
[09:00] Speaker_C | No .
[09:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:10] Speaker_C | Okay , indeed . Yeah ."
[09:12] Speaker_B | Yeah . 'Cause otherwise I think i
"[09:13] Speaker_A | Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? Okay ."
"[09:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven ."
"[09:20] Speaker_D | So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people ."
"[09:27] Speaker_B | I think it does . I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it ."
[09:28] Speaker_C | I think so . It's pretty fancy .
[09:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:35] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[09:37] Speaker_B | I think it does .
[09:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:39] Speaker_D | And the design .
[09:40] Speaker_A | Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .
[09:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:47] Speaker_A | Fancy the old people will .
[09:47] Speaker_B | I would make it a two or something .
[09:49] Speaker_D | A two ?
[09:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:52] Speaker_B | Huh ?
"[09:55] Speaker_A | No , it's a two . Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ?"
[10:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:06] Speaker_D | Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ?"
[10:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think two ."
"[10:18] Speaker_C | It's very fancy , I think . Have you ever seen a remote control like this ?"
"[10:23] Speaker_C | No , okay , so so it's fancy ."
[10:23] Speaker_D | That's fancy enough .
[10:23] Speaker_B | That not .
[10:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:27] Speaker_D | Then ?
[10:29] Speaker_D | Okay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ?
"[10:34] Speaker_B | I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone ."
[10:34] Speaker_D | Enough .
[10:35] Speaker_A | Yeah m
"[10:38] Speaker_C | And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s"
[10:38] Speaker_D | We have for the search function .
[10:42] Speaker_D | The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah .
[10:42] Speaker_C | Eno enough to I think .
[10:47] Speaker_D | True .
"[10:49] Speaker_D | Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people ."
"[10:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , because they're right on your screen ."
[11:00] Speaker_B | So you can use the b the the arrows .
[11:05] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[11:05] Speaker_B | They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . Yeah ."
"[11:08] Speaker_D | Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons ."
"[11:11] Speaker_B | Well , I think they are ."
[11:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:19] Speaker_C | Take a harder look , yeah , sure ."
[11:21] Speaker_D | I think th it's
[11:22] Speaker_C | It's easier than the regular uh remote control .
[11:23] Speaker_D | easy t
"[11:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to"
[11:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[11:35] Speaker_B | No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find ."
[11:36] Speaker_D | to handle .
[11:38] Speaker_D | True .
"[11:41] Speaker_C | Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah ."
[11:46] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[11:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true ."
[11:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:53] Speaker_D | But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text ."
[11:57] Speaker_A | So which number are we going to fill in ?
"[11:59] Speaker_C | I think it's uh it's a two , at least ."
[11:59] Speaker_B | I would say yeah .
[12:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can make it a two ."
"[12:04] Speaker_A | A two , yeah ? Two , three and what do you think ?"
[12:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:09] Speaker_C | A three ? And why is that ?
"[12:09] Speaker_A | Okay , so we have two , two , three ."
"[12:10] Speaker_D | I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy ."
"[12:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . Yeah ."
[12:23] Speaker_D | You can touch it .
[12:27] Speaker_C | It said bo both the options .
[12:27] Speaker_B | You you can touch options .
"[12:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah ."
[12:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:36] Speaker_B | You can touch options and it's comes out .
[12:38] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[12:38] Speaker_C | A two , a two ."
"[12:40] Speaker_A | It's the box below it , huh ?"
[12:40] Speaker_C | Uh the next question the next question . Oh my God .
[12:45] Speaker_A | Otherwise we have two results in one question .
"[12:48] Speaker_A | Okay , next question ."
"[12:49] Speaker_D | It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people ."
[12:54] Speaker_B | For young people I think it's easy to use .
[12:58] Speaker_D | Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight to their death .
"[12:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , I was uh Yeah ."
[13:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:03] Speaker_C | I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh"
"[13:08] Speaker_A | Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , huh ?"
[13:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:26] Speaker_A | As well for the for the older people ?
[13:28] Speaker_C | Uh sure .
[13:38] Speaker_A | And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?
[13:41] Speaker_B | Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .
"[13:48] Speaker_B | Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition ."
[13:48] Speaker_A | M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .
"[13:52] Speaker_C | Channel one , channel four , yeah ."
"[14:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them ."
[14:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:10] Speaker_B | I would make it two .
[14:12] Speaker_D | Also two ? Not a seven for this ?
[14:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[14:13] Speaker_C | Uh a two . Sure , two . Oh ."
[14:15] Speaker_A | I'd say three .
[14:18] Speaker_D | I would also say three .
[14:20] Speaker_B | Oh . You ?
[14:22] Speaker_C | Two .
[14:30] Speaker_A | Another question .
[14:32] Speaker_D | Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .
[14:33] Speaker_B | No .
[14:34] Speaker_C | No .
[14:34] Speaker_A | No .
"[14:35] Speaker_D | No , that that's that's yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one ."
"[14:36] Speaker_B | But um I mean , that's definitely one ."
"[14:39] Speaker_B | Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . Yeah , uh the remote score ."
[14:41] Speaker_D | No ? Oh yeah .
"[14:42] Speaker_C | A false , yeah ."
"[14:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed ."
[14:48] Speaker_B | It's not overwhelmed .
[14:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[14:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , indeed ."
[14:53] Speaker_D | True .
"[14:54] Speaker_A | Okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ?"
[14:54] Speaker_B | Yep .
[14:56] Speaker_D | Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups .
[14:59] Speaker_B | Yes .
[15:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , is optional ."
[15:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:04] Speaker_D | That's true .
"[15:04] Speaker_A | Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ?"
"[15:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Uh I think you can ."
[15:10] Speaker_C | Huh .
[15:11] Speaker_D | Also with rubber ?
"[15:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[15:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:20] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
[15:20] Speaker_B | Well but then when you scratch it it does come off .
[15:22] Speaker_D | That's a one ? Okay .
"[15:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , it is it is harder to"
[15:24] Speaker_A | Do you have many questions ?
[15:30] Speaker_C | Geez .
[15:36] Speaker_B | What ?
[15:37] Speaker_A | What spongy .
"[15:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber ."
[15:39] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[15:39] Speaker_D | Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing ."
[15:43] Speaker_B | I think it's a three .
[15:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:45] Speaker_A | Uh-huh , yeah ."
[15:54] Speaker_D | Remote control is hard to lose .
"[15:55] Speaker_C | Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find ."
"[15:56] Speaker_B | Y yeah , you could you could call it ."
"[15:57] Speaker_D | Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it ."
"[16:06] Speaker_B | Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose ."
"[16:10] Speaker_D | It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally ."
[16:15] Speaker_D | No .
[16:16] Speaker_C | Isn't hard to lose .
[16:20] Speaker_D | Isn't hard to lose .
[16:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:25] Speaker_D | You can't lose it .
[16:27] Speaker_B | It does have an a built in function .
"[16:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , but a har"
[16:31] Speaker_A | A hard to lose is good . So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .
[16:33] Speaker_B | Nee .
[16:35] Speaker_B | Hard to lose . Oh right .
"[16:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , this this is hard to lose ."
"[16:38] Speaker_B | It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , so a two ."
[16:41] Speaker_A | A two .
"[16:41] Speaker_D | I think yeah , I think also ."
[16:43] Speaker_A | A two .
"[16:43] Speaker_C | Two , yeah ."
[16:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:46] Speaker_C | And most all because of the option to Whoa .
[16:47] Speaker_D | Huh ?
[16:52] Speaker_B | Oh .
[16:52] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[16:52] Speaker_D | Yeah ? Oh , okay ."
"[16:56] Speaker_A | Yep . Oh , it isn't , well okay . Remember ."
[16:56] Speaker_D | No .
"[16:56] Speaker_B | Oh well , it doesn't ."
[17:01] Speaker_C | Click .
[17:04] Speaker_C | True .
"[17:04] Speaker_B | I think it will , yeah ."
[17:05] Speaker_D | Yeah ? True ?
[17:07] Speaker_D | Very true ?
"[17:08] Speaker_D | No , I don't think very true because the colours ."
[17:08] Speaker_A | There .
[17:12] Speaker_D | We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much .
"[17:16] Speaker_C | Materials , yeah ."
[17:19] Speaker_B | It's it's much more younger .
[17:19] Speaker_C | Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two .
[17:20] Speaker_D | So I don I think I think it's a three .
"[17:23] Speaker_A | Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ?"
[17:32] Speaker_A | What do you think ?
[17:34] Speaker_A | Questions ?
"[17:34] Speaker_C | A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too ."
[17:35] Speaker_A | Two .
[17:35] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
[17:37] Speaker_B | Two two two . Let's make everything a two .
[17:39] Speaker_D | In the features ?
[17:43] Speaker_C | Well perhaps not .
[17:45] Speaker_D | Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .
[17:48] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well that it doesn't .
"[17:49] Speaker_C | Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours ."
[17:59] Speaker_B | I think they like the speech .
"[18:01] Speaker_B | You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah ."
[18:01] Speaker_D | L_C_D_ screen and scroll .
"[18:04] Speaker_C | Scroll options , yeah ."
[18:05] Speaker_D | I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations .
"[18:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something ."
"[18:14] Speaker_B | Right , that that that those are features ."
[18:15] Speaker_D | No .
"[18:16] Speaker_D | It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature ."
[18:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:21] Speaker_D | The microphone is a feature .
"[18:22] Speaker_B | No , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah ."
[18:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
"[18:31] Speaker_D | I think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings ."
[18:32] Speaker_C | The easy volume up button .
[18:35] Speaker_B | Those are features .
[18:35] Speaker_C | Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume .
[18:44] Speaker_B | Enough features ?
"[18:44] Speaker_D | Personally , yeah . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll"
[18:57] Speaker_D | thing extra .
[18:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:58] Speaker_A | Okay , you think one , what do you think ?"
[19:01] Speaker_B | I think two or three .
[19:04] Speaker_C | Two .
[19:06] Speaker_D | Make it make it a two .
[19:09] Speaker_D | Or make it uh a fucking two . You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ .
[19:10] Speaker_C | Right .
"[19:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ ."
[19:14] Speaker_C | Uh .
[19:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yep .
"[19:19] Speaker_D | Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one ."
[19:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think ."
[19:27] Speaker_D | Maybe two .
"[19:28] Speaker_C | Okay , true , yeah ."
"[19:36] Speaker_B | I think it is , but I don't know what you think ."
"[19:41] Speaker_D | Yeah , tha that's so true ."
[19:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[19:51] Speaker_C | Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button .
[19:55] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[19:57] Speaker_B | And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote ."
"[19:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , you can navigate ."
[20:03] Speaker_C | Uh .
[20:17] Speaker_B | Menu .
"[20:22] Speaker_A | Oh , well that's that's pretty good , huh ?"
"[20:25] Speaker_C | Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah ."
[20:27] Speaker_B | Uh just twos . One three and a few ones .
[20:27] Speaker_C | And three .
[20:32] Speaker_B | Two threes .
"[20:35] Speaker_D | Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The average is a two . That is quite good"
"[20:37] Speaker_B | We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good ."
[20:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:43] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think so too .
[20:44] Speaker_D | in my opinion .
"[20:44] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think so ."
[20:48] Speaker_B | We can be happy .
[20:48] Speaker_D | Ooh .
[20:51] Speaker_D | Ooh .
[20:55] Speaker_C | It's a fly .
[20:56] Speaker_C | Oh m
[20:58] Speaker_B | A f butterfly .
[21:00] Speaker_D | Top .
[21:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:03] Speaker_B | That's it .
[21:04] Speaker_D | Okay .
[21:06] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[21:10] Speaker_D | No , it's two . The average is two ."
[21:12] Speaker_B | It's good . Yeah .
[21:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . Exactly .
"[21:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it ."
"[21:18] Speaker_A | Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit"
[21:26] Speaker_A | difficult to do
"[21:29] Speaker_A | in a group , but I am willing to try it ."
[21:34] Speaker_A | Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .
[21:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:53] Speaker_A | we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I"
[21:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:55] Speaker_B | So we're going to erase features or something .
[22:02] Speaker_A | put the Excel sheet in the
[22:05] Speaker_A | n not in the
[22:07] Speaker_A | folder . I think it's
[22:10] Speaker_A | I think it's still in my own documents folder .
[22:16] Speaker_D | No .
[22:19] Speaker_B | I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .
[22:19] Speaker_A | Oh shit .
"[22:21] Speaker_D | Yeah mm yeah , maybe ."
[22:25] Speaker_D | The microphone . Yeah ? maybe you're going scrap scrap it .
[22:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . It i It wasn't too much .
[22:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:34] Speaker_A | Okay , well this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions ."
[22:41] Speaker_D | No prob .
[22:46] Speaker_D | Ah .
[22:48] Speaker_D | Count it ? Li like write it be
"[22:57] Speaker_C | Oh okay . Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh"
"[23:03] Speaker_B | We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries ."
[23:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:09] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?"
"[23:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . I would do a battery we do . Right ? A battery . One battery , right ?"
[23:14] Speaker_D | Solar cell . No it took a battery ?
[23:15] Speaker_A | We'll wait .
"[23:15] Speaker_C | No , no solar cell , no no no no ."
[23:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:25] Speaker_D | No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do"
[23:26] Speaker_C | On advanced chip .
"[23:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
"[23:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , so this one and this one ."
[23:34] Speaker_B | Uh we ha we have um single what ? Are we ? Oh yay .
"[23:34] Speaker_D | Oh , we already on nine ."
[23:39] Speaker_D | We have double curved .
"[23:40] Speaker_C | Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l"
[23:41] Speaker_D | Single .
[23:46] Speaker_B | Oh the the it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber .
"[23:49] Speaker_D | This one is curved like this , right . It's curved like this ."
[23:51] Speaker_A | I'll just fill it in .
[23:53] Speaker_A | Um rubber indeed ?
"[23:59] Speaker_D | Oh , but we have curves like it and it . There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Rubber ."
[24:01] Speaker_B | Thirteen ?
[24:03] Speaker_C | Huh ?
"[24:03] Speaker_B | With a scroll wheel , right ? Is he integrated ? No , eh ?"
[24:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:08] Speaker_B | I don't know .
"[24:08] Speaker_D | Push button . No , we don't have push button ."
"[24:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s"
[24:16] Speaker_D | L_C_D_ display .
[24:16] Speaker_C | Not going to work ? Okay .
"[24:22] Speaker_B | Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ?"
[24:25] Speaker_C | But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements .
"[24:28] Speaker_B | Oh , we don't have any buttons , so Yeah , we need to uh"
"[24:29] Speaker_D | Eighteen and a half , damn . We have to lower it with six points ."
[24:31] Speaker_C | Damn .
[24:35] Speaker_C | Okay .
[24:36] Speaker_D | Twelve and half .
[24:39] Speaker_B | We could lose the curve .
[24:41] Speaker_C | Nah .
"[24:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , I would lose the curve ."
[24:43] Speaker_C | We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .
"[24:47] Speaker_B | But you can't push it , so you have to tap ."
"[24:48] Speaker_C | Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button ."
"[24:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , alright . So normal scroll wheel ?"
"[24:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think that will be"
[25:00] Speaker_A | our best bet .
[25:00] Speaker_C | Normal scroll wheel .
[25:01] Speaker_B | And I think we should lose the curve .
[25:02] Speaker_D | I think we should scrap the sample speaker . It's four pri it four units .
"[25:07] Speaker_B | Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special ."
"[25:11] Speaker_C | Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . 'S possible to lose curve ."
[25:13] Speaker_D | But w d wha
[25:15] Speaker_D | Curved then it will be square .
"[25:21] Speaker_D | Was that does that mean to it , single curve ?"
"[25:21] Speaker_C | Okay . Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is uh in a dimension . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . Yeah , okay ."
[25:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:27] Speaker_D | Okay .
[25:30] Speaker_B | We would lose this one ?
"[25:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , but tha that that only is one ."
"[25:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit ."
"[25:34] Speaker_C | No , two ."
"[25:36] Speaker_D | No , one ."
[25:38] Speaker_B | Sixteen point three .
"[25:38] Speaker_C | Oh , okay , indeed ."
[25:44] Speaker_B | Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?
"[25:46] Speaker_D | No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen ."
[25:49] Speaker_C | No .
[25:52] Speaker_B | We changed th
"[25:54] Speaker_B | Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved ."
[25:54] Speaker_D | Single curved . Flat .
"[25:56] Speaker_A | Oh , but it's just one"
[25:59] Speaker_B | No .
"[26:02] Speaker_A | Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition ."
"[26:03] Speaker_C | The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points ."
"[26:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's t"
"[26:06] Speaker_D | Yes , four points ."
"[26:07] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special ."
[26:07] Speaker_A | And then you can keep the curve .
[26:10] Speaker_A | Or can't you ?
"[26:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? F You have to we have to scrap four points ."
[26:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[26:18] Speaker_A | Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work ."
[26:20] Speaker_D | Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?
"[26:23] Speaker_C | No , that's no . Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ?"
[26:25] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[26:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , it it i Yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less ."
"[26:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , mm-hmm ."
"[26:34] Speaker_A | Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ?"
[26:36] Speaker_B | Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ?
[26:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:41] Speaker_B | Is that the wood uh wood uh this , we have to have that one too ?"
[26:43] Speaker_D | I think it is .
[26:44] Speaker_C | It isn't .
[26:45] Speaker_C | What ?
[26:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker ."
[26:49] Speaker_D | Yeah . Sample speaker .
"[26:50] Speaker_C | To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor ."
[26:53] Speaker_B | Th then we still have too much
"[26:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , three . Point three ."
"[26:59] Speaker_B | Yeah , we we scrap that one ?"
[27:01] Speaker_D | Huh ?
[27:04] Speaker_D | Point twelve .
[27:10] Speaker_B | Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood .
[27:11] Speaker_C | A colour .
"[27:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , but a wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood ."
"[27:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it"
"[27:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , special colours , fruity colours ."
[27:23] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . You don't say here's green rubber ."
[27:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:34] Speaker_C | They don't sell green rubber plants . Alright .
"[27:34] Speaker_D | Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half ."
"[27:40] Speaker_D | But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh"
"[27:44] Speaker_B | No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess ."
[27:44] Speaker_C | No no no .
[27:44] Speaker_D | s advanced chip .
[27:46] Speaker_D | No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? Then we have two .
[27:50] Speaker_C | If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
[27:56] Speaker_D | S touch .
"[27:56] Speaker_B | A push , yeah ."
"[27:59] Speaker_D | Then we can make add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours it ."
[28:05] Speaker_B | Switch colours .
"[28:12] Speaker_C | You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example ."
[28:12] Speaker_D | They can add two colours .
"[28:19] Speaker_D | But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told ,"
"[28:27] Speaker_C | How d uh uh how many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p"
[28:28] Speaker_B | What do you mean ?
"[28:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium ."
"[28:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour ."
"[28:40] Speaker_B | Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it ."
[28:40] Speaker_D | Ah okay .
[28:41] Speaker_C | I suppose .
[28:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black ."
"[28:47] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote ."
[28:49] Speaker_D | Yeah b
"[28:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now ."
[28:56] Speaker_C | Nee we we also want to make ano another colour .
"[28:57] Speaker_B | Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means ."
"[28:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , but m"
"[29:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , because we have more colours than only black ."
"[29:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ?"
[29:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:08] Speaker_B | Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Yeah ."
[29:09] Speaker_A | Half ?
[29:11] Speaker_A | I think you pay half per remote . So each remote with a special colour .
"[29:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . So then it is one ."
"[29:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , indeed , yeah . You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote ."
"[29:19] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay okay , true ."
"[29:21] Speaker_D | True , true ."
[29:23] Speaker_B | No .
[29:24] Speaker_D | We have two points spare . Nee one point .
"[29:27] Speaker_A | So the battery , we have um advanced chip on print ."
[29:28] Speaker_B | One .
"[29:32] Speaker_B | So it would be curved , single curve ."
"[29:34] Speaker_A | Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again ."
[29:35] Speaker_B | Or not ?
[29:36] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[29:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , single curve ."
"[29:42] Speaker_A | Because that was very important , huh ?"
[29:42] Speaker_B | It's too bad for the speaker .
"[29:44] Speaker_A | So it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker ."
[29:48] Speaker_D | Mm yep .
[29:51] Speaker_A | We dropped the scroll wheel .
"[29:53] Speaker_A | And the rest is the same , huh ?"
[29:56] Speaker_D | Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .
[29:56] Speaker_A | Am I right ? Yes .
[30:01] Speaker_C | Uh . Huh .
[30:01] Speaker_D | Yep .
[30:03] Speaker_B | Perhaps you can then copy page or so .
[30:06] Speaker_B | Ooh .
[30:18] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[30:20] Speaker_C | Undo , undo . Undo ."
[30:24] Speaker_B | Oh not Well .
"[30:26] Speaker_C | So , 'kay . Twenty minutes ?"
[30:27] Speaker_B | Would you ?
"[30:29] Speaker_B | By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page ."
[30:39] Speaker_B | Select all .
"[30:40] Speaker_A | No , but you c yeah ."
"[30:42] Speaker_B | Alright , something went wrong ."
[30:50] Speaker_D | Tap .
[30:55] Speaker_B | It doesn't work . Let's forget .
[30:57] Speaker_D | It should've work .
"[31:01] Speaker_A | Hmm ? No , I hadn't . I just received it ."
"[31:13] Speaker_C | Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , the s"
[31:13] Speaker_B | Too bad .
[31:15] Speaker_B | Yeah . The microphone .
"[31:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , and that's it ."
[31:19] Speaker_C | And the microphone .
[31:25] Speaker_B | Oh no .
[31:27] Speaker_D | Yep .
[31:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[31:29] Speaker_A | Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?"
"[31:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work ."
[31:35] Speaker_A | It didn't work .
[31:39] Speaker_A | Hmm . Strange .
[31:42] Speaker_C | Strange .
[31:45] Speaker_C | You can only re erase ? Oh .
"[31:46] Speaker_B | Erase . When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything ."
"[31:50] Speaker_C | Uh , no ."
"[31:54] Speaker_A | Hmm , can't you then just say copy ?"
[31:57] Speaker_C | Bling .
[31:58] Speaker_A | New page .
[32:01] Speaker_A | Paste . Yes .
[32:02] Speaker_C | Ah .
[32:10] Speaker_B | Just tap somewhere .
"[32:14] Speaker_A | Okay , and now you can erase ."
[32:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[32:17] Speaker_B | I don't think I can , but uh we can try ."
"[32:19] Speaker_C | Uh , we already try ."
[32:20] Speaker_A | Well it should be possible .
"[32:21] Speaker_B | Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha ."
[32:23] Speaker_A | Oh no .
[32:24] Speaker_A | Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . Oh .
[32:24] Speaker_D | No ?
"[32:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much work ."
"[32:31] Speaker_A | Sorry . Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh"
[32:38] Speaker_D | Evaluation drops .
[32:47] Speaker_A | design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
[32:54] Speaker_D | And erase the mic .
"[32:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , goodbye mic ."
"[33:00] Speaker_A | Let's see , we can save this now ."
"[33:01] Speaker_B | Oh , I already erased half of the line ."
[33:07] Speaker_A | And move back to here .
"[33:12] Speaker_B | Too bad , oh ."
[33:24] Speaker_B | Like this ?
[33:25] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:26] Speaker_B | Still looks nice .
"[33:26] Speaker_A | And then all green . Okay , well thank you ."
"[33:29] Speaker_B | Oh , that's erase ."
[33:29] Speaker_D | Looks like a iPod .
"[33:31] Speaker_A | Oh , no ."
"[33:34] Speaker_A | Hey , but you can erase that ."
"[33:35] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's a bit weird . Oh , now I'm line ."
[33:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[33:37] Speaker_A | Uh-oh .
[33:37] Speaker_C | S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
[33:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:42] Speaker_A | Right .
"[33:48] Speaker_A | And you can't erase this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um"
[33:54] Speaker_D | Station page .
[34:10] Speaker_A | what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ?
[34:16] Speaker_C | Deadlines were sometimes very short .
"[34:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready ."
[34:19] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[34:19] Speaker_C | But And stressful .
[34:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:29] Speaker_A | And you could ask things .
[34:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:40] Speaker_D | So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project ."
[34:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:44] Speaker_B | No .
[34:45] Speaker_A | So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .
"[34:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate ."
"[34:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ?"
[34:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[35:00] Speaker_A | Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks ."
[35:01] Speaker_B | I think so too .
[35:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[35:11] Speaker_C | Huh , oh right ."
[35:12] Speaker_A | No .
"[35:20] Speaker_D | Yeah , the technology's okay ."
"[35:20] Speaker_B | Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think ."
[35:23] Speaker_C | Work now ?
[35:27] Speaker_C | Perhaps it is e
"[35:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . Yeah ."
[35:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .

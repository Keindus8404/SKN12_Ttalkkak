[01:04] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[01:07] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[02:09] Speaker_B | Okay well um . So our design looks something like this .
"[02:15] Speaker_B | This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu ."
"[02:28] Speaker_B | And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes yeah , I can change the vegetable . This one's broccoli . So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it ."
"[02:39] Speaker_C | You could change the vegetable , or fruit ."
[02:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:01] Speaker_B | So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
[03:09] Speaker_C | It's been a l
"[03:09] Speaker_B | And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out ."
[03:32] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[03:33] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
[03:44] Speaker_B | Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
[03:47] Speaker_B | And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere .
[03:53] Speaker_B | Yeah we didn't design that .
[03:54] Speaker_C | Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed .
[03:56] Speaker_B | But it would be coordinating with that of course .
[03:58] Speaker_C | Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .
[03:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:01] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[04:07] Speaker_C | So . Tada .
[04:08] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[04:10] Speaker_A | Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet ."
[04:58] Speaker_B | My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
"[05:03] Speaker_B | But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . One side is curved and then the other side is curved ."
[05:03] Speaker_A | Oh . Okay .
[05:07] Speaker_A | Right .
[05:13] Speaker_A | Well yeah . If we're talking about the area just oh I d
[05:20] Speaker_A | I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? Um and lots of special colours actually . Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?
[05:36] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:46] Speaker_B | No I think that's alright .
"[05:48] Speaker_A | Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . And if we sold a lot of squishy things . Boo yeah ."
[06:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
[06:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:17] Speaker_A | Mm .
[06:29] Speaker_D | Um evaluation criteria . I've got a presentation .
[06:36] Speaker_D | So I need where's the cable ?
[06:48] Speaker_D | Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole
[06:57] Speaker_D | this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
[07:06] Speaker_D | Um .
[07:09] Speaker_D | Right .
"[07:11] Speaker_D | This doesn't okay . Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down ."
[08:01] Speaker_D | We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um .
[08:21] Speaker_D | No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?
[08:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[08:27] Speaker_D | Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um ."
"[08:46] Speaker_D | I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told ."
[08:59] Speaker_D | it's in the project documents .
[09:01] Speaker_C | Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .
[09:03] Speaker_D | It's called evaluation criteria .
[09:05] Speaker_C | Okay .
[09:07] Speaker_D | And it's
[09:10] Speaker_D | under evaluation .
"[09:12] Speaker_A | Huh , the PowerPoint one ?"
[09:13] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
[09:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:14] Speaker_C | Okay . Cool .
[09:16] Speaker_D | You've found it all ?
[09:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:27] Speaker_D | Yeah true's one .
[09:34] Speaker_C | True's one and false is seven .
[09:35] Speaker_D | Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?
[09:39] Speaker_A | Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do .
[09:41] Speaker_D | Yeah okay .
[09:50] Speaker_C | So it's actually a scale .
"[09:58] Speaker_D | yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven ."
"[10:00] Speaker_A | One , right okay ."
[10:03] Speaker_A | If it's somewhere in between you put four . Okay .
[10:06] Speaker_C | Okay .
[11:57] Speaker_D | Yes ? Very very true . Okay .
[12:03] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:04] Speaker_A | Are we just about ready ?
[13:07] Speaker_D | Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we um is it necessary ?
[13:21] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay .
[13:21] Speaker_A | Our animals will forever be there .
[13:33] Speaker_D | Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .
[13:37] Speaker_C | One .
[13:38] Speaker_D | Right . Ooh I don't know . Right . One ?
[13:38] Speaker_B | Five .
[13:43] Speaker_B | Five .
[13:44] Speaker_A | Five .
[13:45] Speaker_D | Five . Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?
[13:54] Speaker_B | It's four if you wanna do that .
[13:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[13:56] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
"[13:57] Speaker_B | It adds to sixteen , so that's four ."
[14:00] Speaker_D | Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .
[14:04] Speaker_B | Oh I thought she said five .
[14:05] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[14:07] Speaker_D | One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um next ?"
[14:14] Speaker_C | Um three .
[14:16] Speaker_B | Six .
[14:17] Speaker_A | Six . I wasn't cheating I swear .
[14:18] Speaker_D | Really ? Two . Uh-oh .
[14:28] Speaker_C | So it's a one was true and seven was false ?
[14:32] Speaker_A | Uh .
[14:32] Speaker_B | Huh ?
[14:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:35] Speaker_B | Wait a minute . I thought it was the other way round too .
"[14:42] Speaker_B | Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top ."
[14:43] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah . It was one is true and false is seven . I should've kept the table up .
[14:48] Speaker_B | I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .
[14:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:53] Speaker_D | Right , well I'm glad this came out ."
[14:58] Speaker_D | Yeah . No . Oh that's quite funny .
[15:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
[15:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:26] Speaker_D | Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?"
[15:30] Speaker_C | One .
[15:33] Speaker_B | Say two .
[15:34] Speaker_A | Three .
"[15:37] Speaker_D | Two . Okay , one point two ?"
[15:40] Speaker_C | Uh three .
[15:42] Speaker_B | Two .
[15:42] Speaker_A | Two .
"[15:44] Speaker_D | Two . Okay . Um , one point three ?"
[15:49] Speaker_C | One .
[15:50] Speaker_A | One .
[15:50] Speaker_B | One .
[15:52] Speaker_D | Ha . Two point one ?
[15:56] Speaker_C | Uh two .
[15:56] Speaker_A | Two .
[15:58] Speaker_B | Uh two .
"[16:01] Speaker_A | Two point I think I missed two . Wait , is that two point one ?"
[16:06] Speaker_B | Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .
"[16:06] Speaker_D | Yeah . Oh dear , okay . Sorry ."
"[16:07] Speaker_A | One point four , one point five . Okay right that's I have two of them ."
[16:11] Speaker_B | Mine has all kinds of problems .
"[16:12] Speaker_D | Two and one . Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five ."
[16:17] Speaker_A | One .
[16:19] Speaker_B | Uh three .
[16:21] Speaker_B | Wait why did I put three ?
[16:22] Speaker_C | Uh one .
[16:24] Speaker_B | I meant one on mine too .
[16:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[16:26] Speaker_D | Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ? Yeah ?
[16:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[16:29] Speaker_C | Yeah . Uh one .
[16:32] Speaker_B | Three point one . I have four .
"[16:35] Speaker_D | One , four , three , three , three point two ?"
[16:35] Speaker_A | Three .
[16:40] Speaker_B | Three .
[16:41] Speaker_A | Three .
[16:43] Speaker_C | Uh . One .
[16:46] Speaker_D | Three point three .
[16:48] Speaker_C | One .
[16:48] Speaker_B | One .
[16:50] Speaker_A | Two .
[16:53] Speaker_D | Four point one ?
[16:54] Speaker_C | One .
[16:55] Speaker_B | Two .
[16:56] Speaker_A | Five .
[16:59] Speaker_D | Two . Four point two .
[17:01] Speaker_C | Two .
[17:02] Speaker_B | Three .
[17:03] Speaker_A | Four .
[17:05] Speaker_D | Two and four point three .
[17:09] Speaker_B | Two .
"[17:09] Speaker_D | One , two ."
[17:10] Speaker_C | One .
[17:11] Speaker_A | Two .
[17:13] Speaker_D | Right so I put one on that . Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .
"[17:23] Speaker_A | No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote ."
[17:25] Speaker_D | I didn't know how else to do it .
[17:38] Speaker_D | Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .
[17:42] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:43] Speaker_D | Do does every ones have the slide ? Three point one .
[17:46] Speaker_A | The that was material .
[17:49] Speaker_D | Slide show .
[17:57] Speaker_A | Mm .
[18:03] Speaker_C | Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?
[18:06] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:06] Speaker_D | Yeah that it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .
[18:14] Speaker_D | The shape . Four point two ?
[18:17] Speaker_A | See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining
"[18:21] Speaker_A | the is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It or bigger ?"
[18:25] Speaker_B | I think the wheel would probably be mm .
[18:27] Speaker_C | What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? And like then it you could hold it in your hand better .
"[18:33] Speaker_B | I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish ."
[18:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:39] Speaker_A | No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position ."
[18:44] Speaker_C | Yeah . The flat one . Yeah .
[18:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:03] Speaker_B | Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable .
"[19:10] Speaker_C | But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah ."
[19:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:18] Speaker_C | Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still . I think the broccoli would be out ."
[19:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:27] Speaker_C | You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick ."
"[19:31] Speaker_A | Yeah that I I when you were holding that before , it actually looked yeah ."
[19:33] Speaker_D | Yeah . That looked really good .
"[19:37] Speaker_D | Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?"
[19:40] Speaker_C | Uh .
[19:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:53] Speaker_A | What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .
[20:08] Speaker_C | Huh ? Oh okay .
[20:09] Speaker_A | You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .
"[20:09] Speaker_B | So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry ."
[20:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . That could work .
[20:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:22] Speaker_C | Yeah . I dunno .
[20:22] Speaker_D | Yeah and just have the colour match or something .
[20:35] Speaker_C | Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .
[20:39] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[20:46] Speaker_C | like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable ."
[20:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:57] Speaker_A | Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of yeah ."
[21:01] Speaker_C | Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .
[21:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:12] Speaker_B | We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough ."
[21:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:21] Speaker_A | Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?"
[21:23] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .
[21:33] Speaker_A | I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .
[21:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:42] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[21:43] Speaker_A | And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part ."
[21:48] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[21:51] Speaker_C | Alright .
[21:52] Speaker_A | But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that ?
[22:02] Speaker_C | We could tr I don't know .
[22:07] Speaker_D | Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . .
"[22:16] Speaker_D | Batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more ."
[22:23] Speaker_A | The batteries are going in the back ?
[22:23] Speaker_B | That everyone gave that a one or a two .
[22:26] Speaker_B | Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .
[22:26] Speaker_D | No .
"[22:34] Speaker_B | No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , yeah um like on a normal remote ."
[22:37] Speaker_A | Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .
[22:40] Speaker_A | Right .
"[22:41] Speaker_B | So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably ."
[22:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
[22:46] Speaker_D | I think everyone's under three anyway .
[22:50] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:51] Speaker_D | So I think it's yeah those are the only two points .
[23:00] Speaker_C | Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .
[23:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[23:23] Speaker_C | Mm .
[23:25] Speaker_C | Yeah I dunno .
[23:34] Speaker_B | It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
[23:37] Speaker_C | Yeah that's true . Yeah .
[23:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:40] Speaker_A | And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular ."
[23:42] Speaker_C | Yeah that's true .
[23:45] Speaker_C | Mm .
[23:46] Speaker_B | I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .
[23:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:51] Speaker_A | Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit .
[23:57] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[24:00] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[24:13] Speaker_A | Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . Um so project evaluation ."
[24:44] Speaker_D | It's alright yeah ?
[24:52] Speaker_B | Sure .
[24:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:55] Speaker_C | I did .
[24:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:01] Speaker_C | The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria .
[25:18] Speaker_B | I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
"[25:25] Speaker_A | Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . Um ."
[25:34] Speaker_C | I think you were fine . You did a good job leading .
"[25:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together ."
[25:41] Speaker_D | Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well .
[25:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:44] Speaker_C | Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I don't know , all had ideas about it but yeah ."
[25:48] Speaker_A | Yeah . Very democratic .
"[25:52] Speaker_A | No spats , that was good . Um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?"
"[26:07] Speaker_B | Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . No no I never touch Macs either . I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things ."
[26:20] Speaker_A | Huh .
[26:20] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[26:23] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now .
[26:35] Speaker_B | But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .
"[26:37] Speaker_C | I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda it was kinda like okay , I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , think it's kinda stupid ."
[26:51] Speaker_A | Mm .
[26:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:08] Speaker_B | Yeah . I never use it .
[27:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . It didn't really yeah .
[27:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .
[27:22] Speaker_D | No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . I think it depends on the role no ?
[27:27] Speaker_C | So like a f
[27:29] Speaker_C | Yeah I think so .
[27:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:45] Speaker_B | Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . As if you'd wanted to .
[27:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um
[27:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:57] Speaker_A | System . Yeah .
[28:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[28:12] Speaker_A | Yeah , huh ."
[28:13] Speaker_B | It seems planned you know .
[28:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:43] Speaker_D | But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .
[28:54] Speaker_A | Just yeah .
"[28:57] Speaker_A | Mm , mm ."
[29:04] Speaker_A | What do you guys think of the pens ? It asks about that .
[29:06] Speaker_B | They're pretty cool . They're kinda hard to write with though .
[29:08] Speaker_A | Mm .
[29:08] Speaker_C | I wanna s
[29:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[29:19] Speaker_B | They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write ."
[29:26] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[29:28] Speaker_B | But even so , I dunno ."
[29:33] Speaker_A | And new ideas found ? Yeah .
"[29:37] Speaker_D | Yeah it's all very new , no ?"
[29:41] Speaker_D | It's all very new .
[29:48] Speaker_C | I dunno .
"[29:50] Speaker_C | Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like ."
[29:51] Speaker_D | Sorry .
[29:56] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[29:59] Speaker_B | Well they drop off if you like move too much .
[30:01] Speaker_C | Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay .
[30:06] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[30:10] Speaker_C | all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , or like I dunno ."
[30:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:19] Speaker_B | Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through ."
[30:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:38] Speaker_C | Hm .
[30:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:47] Speaker_A | Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . Yeah .
[30:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:04] Speaker_C | it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause"
"[31:13] Speaker_C | can't really imagine , dunno ."

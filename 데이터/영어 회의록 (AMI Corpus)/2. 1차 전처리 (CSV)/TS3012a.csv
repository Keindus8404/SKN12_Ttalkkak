[01:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .

We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen ."
"[02:32] Speaker_A | Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want ."
"[02:48] Speaker_A | It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want ."
"[02:53] Speaker_A | And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger ."
"[03:08] Speaker_A | So it should be really easy . This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out ."

[04:38] Speaker_B | A head .
[04:48] Speaker_B | Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper .
[04:59] Speaker_A | It looks more like nuclear bomb .

[08:47] Speaker_A | What does it want ?
"[08:49] Speaker_C | Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use ."

"[00:00] Speaker_B | If not more , yeah ."
[00:00] Speaker_C | More .
[00:01] Speaker_D | Mm .
[00:05] Speaker_B | Okay .
[00:19] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[00:30] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[00:56] Speaker_B | So you can um start s checking by y well you you know , you can order it in any way you like , but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely . Um I would recommend , I've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment , I would recommend , like say this one , go down here to the uh trascription transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play , you're certain that when it stops , you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information . Um otherwise it it's liable to keep on running , and you might not notice where it where it finishes ."
[01:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[01:37] Speaker_A | Mm .
[02:15] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:18] Speaker_D | In between .
[02:27] Speaker_D | So we so are we checking what's actually been transcribed already as well as the silences ? Yeah .
"[02:32] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , you're doing so that's that's the role of the checker is to check what's said in the silent regions uh in the speech regions and then make sure nothing was lost in the silent regions . You're also um responsible for resolving any um uncertainties that were marked by the original transcriber . And and you know , of course there are gonna be m many situations where you like the first transcriber can't make any sense of it . And in that case , it will be up to you to use the at symbol . Um and that can be used uh to represent one um unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words , but just use one at symbol . Um yeah , mm-hmm , exactly . And so that um once you go through all the s um speech regions and all the um non-speech regions , an o you could make another step of doing a search using um going under the edit menu you can"
[02:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:41] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
[02:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[03:44] Speaker_A | Find replace , yeah ."
[03:58] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[03:58] Speaker_D | Oh , alright 'kay ."
[04:10] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
"[04:30] Speaker_A | How much should you want um I had a few times where I thought well , it could be this , but if you're not entirely sure that it could be , 'cause it c it could be a combination of something else , like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way ."
[04:36] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[04:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:56] Speaker_A | Right .
[04:59] Speaker_A | There's a chance they could be .
"[05:05] Speaker_C | It's usually a context problem , because I think sometimes if it's not intelligible you either tend to because you really want it to fit the context , um you tend to take the closest actual word that would fit the context , or if it sometimes it sounds very clear as a word itself , but then wouldn't make sense at all , and then you m question , you know , second-guess whether it's really what you heard ."
[05:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:13] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
"[05:28] Speaker_B | Right . So maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one , do listen to the silent and non-silent regions and make all those corrections , leave the unknowns , the um ambiguities , the uncertainties uncertainties until later . So go through all the channels and do that , and then um then you should have the context from all four speakers , and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel . How would that be ? Does that sound good ?"
[05:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:52] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:58] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[05:58] Speaker_A | Mm , that's what I've been doing so far ."
[06:00] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:10] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[06:19] Speaker_A | But if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and I scream , then just choose one and leave it , right ."
[06:25] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[06:27] Speaker_B | Choose one , it c I mean y think of it from a speech recognition point of view again . And always this should be this should motivate you . Yeah . What is most robust for a speech recognition and and leave out anything So you're well geared towards this task . Um So I've gone through Sorry ."
[06:52] Speaker_A | You're an S_L_P_ person .
"[06:55] Speaker_C | Oh , never I I don't wanna interrupt it . Uh uh when I did my masters um I took uh S_P_ one and S_P_ two with Simon King ."
"[06:56] Speaker_B | Oh no no no . Go ahead , go ahead ."
"[07:04] Speaker_C | Yes . And actually I've done quite well in S_P_ one , I've done it a bit worse in S_P_ two because it was a l a lot more challenging ."
[07:12] Speaker_A | We have two new teachers for S_P_ two .
[07:14] Speaker_C | Okay .
[07:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:20] Speaker_C | Right . Okay . Back to the topic .
[07:25] Speaker_B | Okay okay . So um this is one I've gone through . I've just done one channel . And there were lots of lots and lots and lots of things as you can see . 'Cause I've got square brackets around all the things that need to be changed . Um so this person didn't ha um th obviously didn't know about capitalisation . So just about every utterance needs to be capitalised and and needs the end punctuation .
[07:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[07:52] Speaker_D | You know , when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in , but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence , do you have to capitalise each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid"
[07:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:04] Speaker_B | Um , no no no . Whatever um makes sense to you . Um but no , it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine ."
[08:06] Speaker_D | No no no no . Yeah .
[08:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:15] Speaker_C | I think that's actually the only case where you don't or where you're not supposed to capitalise , right ? So if it's quite clear that the sentence is being carried on , the p you know , the sentence from the previous segment is being carried on , then that's when you don't capitalise . Otherwise you do ."
[08:16] Speaker_A | Mm the hyph
[08:20] Speaker_D | Right .
[08:30] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:30] Speaker_A | And you only use the hyphen I think when the sentence is definitely not continuing anywhere .
[08:34] Speaker_C | Yes .
[08:35] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[08:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:53] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[08:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:27] Speaker_D | Okay .
[09:27] Speaker_A | Right .
[09:38] Speaker_A | It was the creaky voice .
[09:43] Speaker_A | Creaky voice . But it is c really connected to the word . Can we hear it again ?
[09:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:48] Speaker_C | And you sometimes you don't know really whether it's a mic noise or that person is making that noise .
"[09:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , well I didn't think it was im let's see , wait ."
[09:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:09] Speaker_B | Yeah . S there's there's actually quite a bit more in there than than I heard before . This is so I w I heard a creaky voice , and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech . So I would I would keep that . I think that's good . Oh , okay . I was adding that , that's what I was doing . That makes sense . Okay , there you go . Um so there's things like that . Um sh there's a missing false start here um that didn't get caught ."
[10:10] Speaker_A | From the
[10:38] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[10:44] Speaker_B | So I added that in . Um so that that's something that's quite common in the transcriptions that I've looked at . Missed false starts , um missed m"
[10:49] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[10:54] Speaker_C | And how exact do we have to be there ? Because um you know , some people tend to stutter more than others and then they would have a false start four or five times in a row . And how important is it to listen to it really until you've got the exact number of a things right ? Yeah ."
"[11:15] Speaker_C | Yeah . Well , 'cause sometimes they go you know , like that , and then you're not really sure whether it's three times or four yeah ."
[11:31] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[11:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[11:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[12:06] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[12:11] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Make your best guess . Try to listen to it carefully enough , but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long ."
[12:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:28] Speaker_B | I would say .
[12:36] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[12:38] Speaker_B | Alright . Well there again , f uh think about robustness and speech uh recognition and it really doesn't matter . If it's a word fragment , who cares . It you're marking it as a fragment , and that's what's important ."
[12:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
[13:11] Speaker_B | Well um I wouldn't de be using the star so liberally um for a non-native speaker .
"[13:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's what I thought , that you're not supposed to do it , but um the one there's one I'm transcribing right now , you know , a whole batch of dialogues where uh all four participants are non-native , and there's especially one there that um I think he's Eastern European and I think that's the only reason I can understand what he's saying at all , because I'm Eastern European and uh but if we would just play it I think to a recognizer , then what he says , you know , the way he realises words , sounds nothing at all like it it should be ."
[13:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[14:11] Speaker_C | No , it's less of a s it's less of a stress . It's really like uh his uh , I don't know , just the phonemes sounding differently ."
"[14:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well , I wouldn't bother to mark all of those instances though ."
"[14:24] Speaker_C | Well , you can't really , because it would be all of it ."
"[14:26] Speaker_B | No , I mean yeah , they're they're uh you're gonna find that for any speaker , they have a set way of of realising these things . And and it's just like Fiona was saying , um that the the word that stands out is something really uh aberrant . Like um I'm thinking of I I've used this example before , there's a guy who says project instead of product and uh it's something like project and it's probably just his his pronunciation of of ."
[14:54] Speaker_C | Oh .
[14:54] Speaker_A | Ah .
[14:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:57] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[15:02] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well , it it they were clearly talking about a product . So so uh I m I marked that as a m uh mispronunciation or s or something to flag anyway ."
[15:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:10] Speaker_C | Mm . Okay .
"[15:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . And one guy who was saying evolution each time he meant evaluation , and it took me a whole dialogue Yeah , yeah ."
"[15:17] Speaker_B | Oh , evaluation . Yeah , I I've I remember that . That one I would I would flag , just like you did . It that's something definitely to mark up ."
"[15:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , but that's really something I would always transcribe it , you know , for lack of better knowledge or lack of context , and then at the end of the dialogue it dawned on me that he actually meant evaluation , and then I went back and replaced I replaced it in the whole transcription ."
[15:35] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[15:40] Speaker_B | That's good . That's good .
"[15:41] Speaker_A | Well , at the moment we have a lecturer that can I can never quite s tell if he's saying problem or programme . Programme problem . And it I can't actually say but when I'm listening to , I'm thinking And I can't tell ."
[15:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:08] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[16:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . Wait .
"[16:19] Speaker_C | Well , we have both head-set and lapel transcription . So it's not too bad ."
[16:23] Speaker_B | Oops .
[16:53] Speaker_D | Mm .
[16:53] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[16:57] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[17:09] Speaker_C | Um sorry , I'm just seeing this with the T_V_ , there is T_ underscore V_ underscore . I thought we're just supposed to use the underscore between letters ? No ?"
[17:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[17:18] Speaker_B | No , no . After ."
[17:19] Speaker_A | That's what I thought the first day as well .
"[17:23] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah , it should be after every um acronym letter ."
[17:25] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:27] Speaker_D | You know , um you standardised all the the filled pauses , the uh and do we need to go through and change ones that people did differently . Like if I where I've written E_R_ for uh , change it all to U_ H_ , that sort of thing ?"
[17:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[17:47] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:52] Speaker_A | Right .
[17:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:58] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , just change it to um ."
[18:06] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:08] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:28] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[18:29] Speaker_A | That wor the hyphen .
"[18:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , there ."
"[18:32] Speaker_A | So I have to re-do the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting . Was she was that a like w r real definite I'm starting a new sentence here , 'cause I'd sometime if it sounds like he could carry on saying the whole sentence , I sometimes don't have a hyphen there . But is it a t any hesitation ? Okay . Okay ."
[18:52] Speaker_C | But it is a back-track .
[18:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . So it's not necessarily restarting the sentence , but just a restart of any type . A phrase ."
"[18:54] Speaker_D | We do the meeting . The minutes , yeah ."
[18:57] Speaker_A | Right .
[19:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:09] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[19:28] Speaker_B | Here's a uh so that answers your question about that answers your question about this one up here ? Okay . Here's where I've I heard a another sound , another false start . Um or a stutter , I would say ."
"[19:31] Speaker_A | Sorry ? Yes , yeah ."
[19:47] Speaker_B | Let me see . Oh yeah .
[19:57] Speaker_A | You're three lines in .
"[19:59] Speaker_B | Okay . Okay , okay ."
[20:03] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[20:12] Speaker_B | So , that kind of thing . And there was a vowel in there , but you noticed that she just used the and that's fine . The the letter D_ ."
[20:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[20:18] Speaker_D | Okay .
[20:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:34] Speaker_B | Oh , sorry . I didn't go f back far enough ."
"[20:37] Speaker_A | Oh , I've not used that button yet ."
"[20:39] Speaker_D | Where you've written at et cetera , is that how we're supposed to be writing it ? Okay ."
"[20:42] Speaker_B | Yes . Um where is that . Yes , she's so she spelled it wrong . Um uh up here ."
[20:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:49] Speaker_C | Where ?
"[20:51] Speaker_C | Oh , et cetera ."
"[20:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , so I d I mentioned that because of spelling . And yes , any g"
[20:56] Speaker_C | Is it one word or is it two words ?
[20:58] Speaker_B | It's one word . So I d I just said spelling . It's an admonishment . Sorry ?
[20:58] Speaker_C | Okay .
[21:02] Speaker_C | Because I thought it would be like et alii .
[21:07] Speaker_D | Et cetera .
[21:18] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:26] Speaker_A | In the dictionary here it's one word .
"[21:27] Speaker_C | Yeah . Oh in it is , okay , yeah ."
[21:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[21:38] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:47] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , yeah ."
[21:53] Speaker_B | We've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check . You could take this as an Emacs file and run a spell check on it . But I think it would slow things down too much . So just hopefully i in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these misspellings .
[21:57] Speaker_D | Mm .
[22:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[22:11] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think i if somebody could write I don't know how difficult it would be in practice to write a script that would ignore um all the word fragments , anything with a hyphen . Then a spell-check might make make sense . But uh to just use simple Emacs , it will uh basically mark um all the word fragments for you , and uh , you know , and I know from experience , at some point you also get negligent , you just click okay okay okay , you know , that's not a mistake , and then you might miss a real error . So it doesn't make any sense ."
[22:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[22:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[22:39] Speaker_B | Right . Yeah , I th I think you're right . So we'll we will just hope that you catch it . Um That's what we'll do ."
[22:54] Speaker_B | Sorry .
[23:01] Speaker_B | So I think she just she didn't catch the full form .
[23:02] Speaker_D | Okay .
[23:03] Speaker_A | She was cutting off rather than saying she would like s to have see something .
[23:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:07] Speaker_B | Right , right . Yeah . She I think she meant to use the infinitive , but she just left off the to ."
[23:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:12] Speaker_C | But see is a actual full word , shouldn't it there b shouldn't there be a space between see and the hyphen ?"
[23:13] Speaker_A | Is a whole word .
[23:19] Speaker_B | A space between She would like see . She would like see .
[23:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:24] Speaker_C | After the no , the the C_ and the hyphen , shouldn't there be a space ?"
"[23:26] Speaker_B | Yes yes yes , you're right . Yeah ."
[23:30] Speaker_C | Okay .
[23:30] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[23:31] Speaker_B | Exactly . Uh that was what you were m remarking about . Okay . There we go . Let me save that . Okay .
[23:51] Speaker_C | Um the would and w
[24:06] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[24:06] Speaker_C | No . But sometimes it's really difficult , sometimes you really don't know whether they're saying will or would ."
"[24:11] Speaker_B | Well , I think it's quite clear there . I mean obviously there are gonna be ca"
[24:12] Speaker_D | That one was clear .
"[24:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , he it it's his yeah ."
"[24:19] Speaker_B | No , you try to keep it as true to what's being said ."
"[24:21] Speaker_C | B yeah . But if it but if it's really not absolutely not clear ,"
"[24:26] Speaker_C | when they say instea you know , some people when they swallow up the the last bit ."
"[24:32] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . I'd have to hear it , because it m sounds like it could be a fragment . Uh it ju I'd just have to hear it . Um M I'd you don't want to b um be prescriptive and and type what you think they should've said . But"
[24:33] Speaker_C | Or do we just then transcribe ? Yeah .
[24:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[24:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:50] Speaker_B | but I I I do know the type of scenario you're describing . I just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something . Mm .
[24:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[25:02] Speaker_C | The um should be capitalised .
[25:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:06] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[25:08] Speaker_A | Should it ? 'Cause the loose uh is continuing from one sentence , isn't it ?"
"[25:10] Speaker_B | Uh let's see . Oh yeah , y you're right . Right . That's right . Okay ."
"[25:11] Speaker_C | Oh , okay . No . Yeah ."
[25:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
[25:21] Speaker_B | Yes .
[25:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:26] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
"[25:43] Speaker_A | Sometimes I've made buts after la like words after laughter , I've made them capitalised , 'cause I've not been sure if there's an if the laughter's been cutting everything off ."
"[25:51] Speaker_B | Mm . If it sounds like um the laughter is just um interrupting a an utterance that continues after the laughter , I wouldn't worry about capitalising ."
[25:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:59] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[26:17] Speaker_B | If you hear just laughter on either side , yeah , do that ."
"[26:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . No , but it's it's laughter th throughout ."
[26:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . There's some people laughing themselves silly at absolutely nothing while while they speak .
[26:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[26:39] Speaker_C | Because in the ICSI dialogues um they always say , you know , while laughing , and we don't do that . So They say either so there it's really not ambiguous whether it's just laugh followed by an a normally spoken utterance or whether it's an utterance spoken while laughing . I think there is a distinction there and we don't have that ."
[26:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:56] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[26:58] Speaker_B | No , we don't have any qual tags like they use . But um I'll f I'll"
[26:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:05] Speaker_B | I'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or email you .
[27:07] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[27:24] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , I don't know what that that noise was indicating . Um we can skip on . There are other types of things I wanna point out ."
[27:34] Speaker_B | Um let's see .
[28:02] Speaker_A | Was that circuit ?
[28:05] Speaker_C | Morse .
[28:08] Speaker_B | Did she say circuit ? I didn't really hear that .
[28:09] Speaker_D | How do you know it's that ?
[28:11] Speaker_B | So would would you have been tempted to put an asterisk after that ?
[28:20] Speaker_B | Uh yeah .
"[28:20] Speaker_A | No , not for that one . But I had one person who said circuit . The ."
[28:20] Speaker_D | Cir circuit .
[28:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:23] Speaker_C | But then I w but then I wouldn't put an asterisk on it . I thought asterisk is something where um it's c it's pronounced as a totally different word , like evaluation and evolution . No ? Okay ."
"[28:34] Speaker_B | No , not necessarily . No , it's just something that the speech recognizer is liable to trip up on , I think ."
"[28:39] Speaker_C | Oh . Yeah , cause I this is a very frequent mistake that no native speakers make , to say circuit instead of circuit ."
[28:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[28:46] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Um y that may be , but I probably would flag it . I depending on how how different the vowel sound was . It's gonna be your call in a lot of these cases ."
[28:55] Speaker_C | Mm .
[28:56] Speaker_D | Oops .
"[29:25] Speaker_B | But you know , because she's a non-native English speaker , I don't I don't know . Maybe that was grammatically n uh"
[29:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[29:41] Speaker_A | Yeah , 'cause otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen after every hesitation mark that you have ."
[29:52] Speaker_A | Just a prosodic marker rather than an actual hesitation .
[29:57] Speaker_A | Uh as in a whole s like back-channel .
[30:02] Speaker_B | Unless you kinda get Right .
[30:12] Speaker_C | Is push buttons two words ?
"[30:14] Speaker_B | Uh yeah , yeah . Yeah , I would type it as two . Mm okay , I'm gonna skip ahead . Oh , let's see , there was a c"
[30:16] Speaker_C | I used one word .
[30:18] Speaker_C | Okay .
[30:33] Speaker_B | So I I hear she would quite clearly there and I think a good number of them you'll be able to resolve just just helps to have the context and be able to listen to it again .
[30:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
[30:43] Speaker_C | Well it could be she would or should as well . Yeah .
[30:58] Speaker_B | So there is there is another case where there wasn't a space between uh
[31:02] Speaker_D | Right .
[31:04] Speaker_B | a non-word fragment and um
[31:06] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[31:49] Speaker_A | Well , not yeah . I know , I yeah , you could think of an argu"
[32:08] Speaker_B | Delete and collapse .
"[32:15] Speaker_B | I'm trying to underst I'm trying to interpret my note here . Delete and collapse the surrounding segments . Okay , I guess there there just really wasn't enough to transcribe there . Yeah ."
"[32:21] Speaker_A | Oh , d"
"[32:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , because it was it was really just silence and you're asking the person to just get rid of ."
[32:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[32:52] Speaker_A | Oh , I just noticed the the random yeahs , like with having the hyphen before they're s"
[33:00] Speaker_A | Uh if you scroll up a little way .
[33:01] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[33:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , that ha um the second one from the top . Thinking I'm gonna have to go back and find my places where I've had someone pausing and then saying yeah yeah and then this that I've not had I need to go back and find uh p put hyphens in ."
[33:09] Speaker_B | This one ?
"[33:18] Speaker_B | Oh so you haven't put a hyphen there . I see , I see . Yeah ."
[33:20] Speaker_C | Mm .
[33:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
[33:24] Speaker_A | Hyphens or commas ?
[33:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:33] Speaker_B | For g for that s type of situation ?
[33:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
"[33:37] Speaker_D | Actually , um a couple of times where they've repeated a word , I've put a comma between them . Should that be no comma ? Oh , r okay ."
[33:47] Speaker_D | Right .
"[33:49] Speaker_A | Alright , okay ."
[33:50] Speaker_C | Oh . Okay .
[33:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:57] Speaker_B | I I am too . I I like commas and then uh Steve Renals , who's project manager , had a look at m I think it was my transcriptions . What are all these commas doing in here ? But he didn't he ultimately he said it wasn't a problem . They will I th they'll help in the case of discourse marking , but his point was that they're really subjective , I mean something that you the transcriber here Yeah , yeah . I really like using commas . Oh ."
[34:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[34:11] Speaker_D | Okay , cool ."
[34:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:48] Speaker_A | Cutest ?
[35:02] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
"[35:08] Speaker_B | But I you can see how it could've been , I don't know ."
[35:08] Speaker_C | Oh .
[35:08] Speaker_A | Oh .
[35:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[35:11] Speaker_C | Well , if you were Cockney , then Sorry ."
"[35:16] Speaker_D | Sometimes you get like an uh and it g you're not sure if it's an , an A_ , yeah , or an m it Yeah ."
"[35:22] Speaker_B | Right . And you can never know , but if it fits well enough as a as an indefinite article , then you might as well ."
[35:26] Speaker_D | As an .
"[35:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , do it as Okay ."
"[35:31] Speaker_B | Oh , I was s I was suggesting that sh it be uh instead of our ."
[35:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:49] Speaker_A | Evaluala ?
[36:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[36:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[36:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[36:11] Speaker_A | I've had one person with a dodgy headphone with with dodgy something where most of the time it's it's as if they've got their hand over something .
[36:14] Speaker_B | Oh . Oh .
"[36:20] Speaker_B | Oh God . And you transcribed that speaker entirely ? If that comes up again , we've got um headset mic files now . In fact , they replaced all the lapel mic files on the M_M_M_ server with head-set mic files , which we weren't asking them to do , but anyway they did it . And so now we don't have the lapel mic files . Apparently the headset mic files are are just a bit louder . And so you'll f probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably . But but apparently other than that they're just as good . But let us know , because we can retrieve the the other files ."
[36:21] Speaker_D | That's harsh .
[36:30] Speaker_A | Right .
[36:35] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[36:35] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[36:35] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
[36:46] Speaker_A | Right .
[36:46] Speaker_D | Right .
[36:53] Speaker_A | Right .
"[36:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , with some people it actually leads to some really screeching noises , because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close . I had this one um in one of the first dialogues I did , the g this guy called Ed , you could uh always see the waveform actually , you know , being just hitting um the b the boundaries on on both ends and just being at some points just black segments . And when he was talking there was this whole , like you know when you speak to close to a microphone , and that was really horrible ."
[37:37] Speaker_C | The rest .
[37:41] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[37:44] Speaker_A | How about names that somebody says the name of somebody and you think , who ? And you don't know how to spell the name or if you heard the right name ."
[37:46] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[37:49] Speaker_B | Uh right , right . Um what are we going to do for that ."
[37:56] Speaker_C | Mister Ed .
[37:58] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[38:08] Speaker_A | Mister Ed .
[38:08] Speaker_D | Mister Ed ?
"[38:16] Speaker_C | Yeah . No , but that it wasn't one word , that it wasn't like some proper name starting with M_ ."
[38:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[38:25] Speaker_B | I d I did see s I've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and I did see something about proper names , so I'll I'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here ."
[38:33] Speaker_A | Right .
[38:55] Speaker_C | Okay . Yeah .
"[38:58] Speaker_C | No , but it's information that we theoretically have ."
"[39:01] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment . So we ought to be able to get that . But but there shou we should also have a w a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way . So I'll th I'll I'll try to address both things ."
[39:03] Speaker_C | Mm .
[39:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[39:24] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[39:29] Speaker_B | Oh , just just type Mister fully . I M_I_S_T_E_R_ , yeah . And same with missus , M_I_S_S_U_S_ , I believe . Is it I believe I believe check check the dictionary . That yeah , but you would never um type the abbreviated spelling for anything ."
[39:32] Speaker_D | M_ I_ S_ T_ E_ R_ .
"[39:37] Speaker_D | Okay , Missus . Missus ."
[39:38] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[39:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[39:46] Speaker_C | What if somebody calls themselves Ms ?
[39:46] Speaker_A | Right .
"[39:49] Speaker_B | Um well , I'm sure there's a spelling in the O_E_D_ , yeah ."
"[39:49] Speaker_C | I mean it's not not that it ever happened , but yeah ."
[39:56] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[40:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . Not come across any yet .
[40:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[40:09] Speaker_A | Oh .
[40:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[40:11] Speaker_B | That's a good question , because you will be leaving question marks there . Um okay . Right . Um it shouldn't , because things are going to be left like the asterisk will be left for the proc the subsequent processing . But carets with question marks in-between would have to be resolved in some way ."
[40:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[40:17] Speaker_D | I mean if it's in carets and they know it's foreign , does that matter ?"
"[40:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , and the at symbol ."
[40:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[40:37] Speaker_D | Or could we just change it to an at between the carets ? 'Cause it's only intelligible theoretically .
[40:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[40:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[40:52] Speaker_B | Oh yeah yeah . If you if if f it's a foreign word and you know what it is , just enclose it in carets ."
"[40:57] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , 'cause I have there is one dialogue where I think two speakers are French , like one is definitely French , and I know she is saying and then somebody s saying something to her and she goes comment and then you know you know that , so yeah ."
[41:09] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[41:14] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[41:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Okay . Um there is there is just one other thing , she she typed okay um in caps . O_ c c O_ capital O_ capital K_ and huge no-no , I don't know why she missed that in the in the guidelines . Yeah ."
"[41:29] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , I saw it there ."
[41:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[41:37] Speaker_A | There it was .
"[41:38] Speaker_D | Are we doing okay just as O_ K_ , not as a O_K_A_Y_ ?"
[41:41] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[41:43] Speaker_B | It is O_K_A_Y_ . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . Well , it will be your jobs to catch all of these things . So no um n no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their t own transcription . Yes . Yes . So we will catch these things"
[41:43] Speaker_C | No .
[42:02] Speaker_C | Their own .
[42:03] Speaker_D | Checking their own work .
[42:03] Speaker_A | Checking their own transcription .
[42:06] Speaker_D | Right .
[42:10] Speaker_D | Have to remember that one now .
"[42:11] Speaker_B | more efficiently , I think . And on so I'll just go up to the board do I have to keep this stuff on ?"
"[42:20] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , they've got clips ."
"[42:23] Speaker_B | Right , I'm mobile . Alright ."
[42:25] Speaker_D | D Yeah . Wrestling to the white-board .
[42:30] Speaker_A | And about five or six breaks in the between is the making it a .
"[42:35] Speaker_B | Okay . So I guess just for the sake of using the white-board and killing a little more time I'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked . So let's see . So oh , okay . Now ."
"[42:49] Speaker_C | Oh , the white-board marker has a camera as well ."
[42:53] Speaker_D | Wow .
"[42:54] Speaker_B | Okay , s alright . Rather this is a list of things to do as the checker . So you wanna listen to the silent regions ."
[43:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[43:06] Speaker_B | Then check the speech regions .
[43:13] Speaker_B | And as part of that you want to um check the boundaries .
[43:27] Speaker_B | Um transcribe
[43:33] Speaker_B | any missed speech .
"[43:53] Speaker_B | Look for missed punctuation ,"
"[44:03] Speaker_B | filled pauses ,"
[44:23] Speaker_D | Okay .
[44:29] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
[44:37] Speaker_B | And what else . Try to get f false starts .
"[44:46] Speaker_B | Short words , make sure with little words like the and uh , little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted . Um short words and word fragments ."
[44:59] Speaker_B | Those are the commonly missed things .
[45:07] Speaker_B | And then um look for cases of mis-transcription
[45:41] Speaker_C | M_ .
[45:43] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[45:48] Speaker_A | Oh .
[46:00] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[46:05] Speaker_A | I just remembered one .
"[46:08] Speaker_A | Okay , when it's just as 'kay , but it's at the beginning of a sentence , should the K_ be capitalised ?"
[46:13] Speaker_C | No well apostrophe and then K_ A_ Y_ .
[46:21] Speaker_C | That marker smells really bad .
[46:53] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[46:53] Speaker_D | Okay .
[47:15] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[47:17] Speaker_C | Over a minute .
"[47:18] Speaker_B | Yeah , but that's a kind of crude guideline . I'd I'd say just anything that seems unmanageable ."
[47:22] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[47:25] Speaker_C | Okay . So if something is a minute and three seconds I can still have it , right ?"
"[47:29] Speaker_B | Ah . Yeah , yeah . Really uh it it means nothing to say a minute , it's just a g a really crude guideline . I would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but u you know , use these wave-forms to help you . And you can adjust the resolution so that Oh . That didn't help me too much , but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution . Actually that doesn't seem to be working ."
[47:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[47:44] Speaker_D | Yeah , b"
[47:55] Speaker_C | Um if you just click on one of the arrows .
[48:00] Speaker_B | Which o
[48:01] Speaker_A | The arrows by the resolution .
"[48:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , on this one . No , not not the other one , this one . Yeah ."
[48:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[48:07] Speaker_A | Not that one . The other arrow next to it .
[48:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[48:11] Speaker_B | Right , okay , okay . So yeah ."
[48:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[48:17] Speaker_D | Wow .
"[48:19] Speaker_C | Um that's it's something under signal , where you can adjust the amplitude as well , on resolution ."
[48:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[48:28] Speaker_B | Oh okay , right ."
"[48:29] Speaker_C | Then you can also wait . No , I think that's not if you go to control panel ."
[48:29] Speaker_A | Oh .
[48:34] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[48:35] Speaker_C | Signal control panel . No no , signal , control pan"
[48:39] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
"[48:44] Speaker_A | Ooh . Ah . That might have made it s 'cause I I appear to have nothing . But I was hearing stuff , but I g there was nothing on my wave-form . It's kinda hard to find where everything was ."
[48:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[48:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[48:59] Speaker_A | Control panel .
[49:14] Speaker_A | Right .
[49:27] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[49:33] Speaker_A | No , probably not ."
[49:36] Speaker_C | Mm .
[49:37] Speaker_A | No .
[49:47] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[49:49] Speaker_C | Okay .
[49:50] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[49:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[49:56] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , that's true actually , that's the best reason for cutting them down , but hopefully the that'll be done during the first pass , because that's the whole point . Making the checkers' job a little easier . Um and then , yeah , just m um be sure after you've gone through the four channels to um do a search on all the unknowns , all the um cases of ambiguity or whatever . And what else was I gonna say ? The way we'll be allocating this is is the same as before , th it's gonna be on the th the same the same page , just further down . Scroll down , you'll see w all the files . And uh I've already allocated some some things to be checked . So if you run out of work , go ahead and start checking , because this is something that's um considerably um bottle-necked at the moment ."
[50:04] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[50:35] Speaker_A | The work allocation page .
[50:40] Speaker_C | Mm .
[50:54] Speaker_A | Right .
[50:54] Speaker_D | So is this the priority then ?
"[50:56] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'd say for now um w we don't even have uh much new stuff to be uh to be gone over for a first pass . So it's important that we d um do this second pass . And I've indicated in a column whether something is priority . M I think I high typed high if it's high priority . Um so d those would be the ones you would focus on first , obviously . And when it come you don't want to change the file-name in any way . Just keep it the same . Um there there is going to be a checking in procedure . I don't know if anybody's mentioned this before , but you'll you'll know about this with the C_V_S_ server . So th"
[51:04] Speaker_D | Transcri yeah .
[51:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[51:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[51:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[51:39] Speaker_C | Mm yeah . Well , I don't know about I know about this for the summarisation , I haven't done this with uh transcription yet . Yeah ."
[51:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[51:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[51:58] Speaker_A | Checking in page . Oh right .
[52:06] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[52:12] Speaker_D | So do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass , like open up the sound file and then it sh"
[52:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[52:25] Speaker_D | In your home directory .
[52:32] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[53:04] Speaker_D | Then you'll lose it , yeah ."
[53:23] Speaker_D | Okay .
[53:30] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[53:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[53:48] Speaker_D | Sh Yeah , someone said three months . Yeah ."
"[53:49] Speaker_C | Um I've got a three month contract , yeah ."
[53:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[53:58] Speaker_A | Right .
"[54:02] Speaker_A | Okay , that's . Cool ."
"[54:02] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
[54:07] Speaker_A | Right .
[54:10] Speaker_D | Mm .
[54:17] Speaker_A | Right .
"[54:20] Speaker_D | Okay . Once we actually get into the like um Easter holidays , 'cause we're at having lectures at the moment , can we be more flexible with our hours if we wanna sort of I mean depending on who's using the computers ."
[54:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[54:28] Speaker_B | I should think so . I mean the whole point w of keeping well , as long as you're able to , yeah , work out use of your computer with the other person , that's fine , yeah . The the whole point of having m regular hours was to make sure that somebody was here to answer your questions . But you've got keys , so so you should be able to get in during odd hours if if you wanted to work ."
[54:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[54:37] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[54:43] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure ."
[54:44] Speaker_A | Or else you can like p yes .
[54:56] Speaker_D | Okay .
[54:58] Speaker_D | Know what you're doing .
"[55:14] Speaker_A | I'm having sort some s I'm having to sort some tax stuff out before I can even send my stuff in , 'cause I need to make sure I'm sending them the right form . But they won't even know what examining board I got my A_ levels in . Yeah , for human resources . I thought , surely you don't need that information , 'cause it took me it was about to take me half an hour well it did when I was like just going through the forms and filling in all the details , I thought I'm not going to spend w"
[55:18] Speaker_B | Mm . Okay .
[55:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[55:21] Speaker_B | Okay .
[55:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[55:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[55:49] Speaker_B | Mm no .
"[55:53] Speaker_A | A_ level like examining board , which seemed a bit ridiculous ."
"[55:56] Speaker_B | If you have any th problems like that , mm um see Caroline Hastings . I mean if it's for this job and and getting paid , that that's not necessary and Caroline Hastings ought to be able to help you sort that out . But j also if if pay is a matter um like if it's a matter that you haven't gotten paid for some reason , um I hope that's not not the case ."
[56:02] Speaker_A | Right . Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[56:03] Speaker_C | Mm .
[56:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[56:06] Speaker_A | Didn't think so .
[56:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[56:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , I haven't gotten paid for the first two weeks , 'cause um I w I only have a three month contract starting February , but I started mid-January ."
[56:23] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[56:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[56:26] Speaker_D | Oh .
[56:32] Speaker_A | Mm .
[56:33] Speaker_A | Alright .

[57:09] Speaker_A | Wow .
[57:16] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[57:21] Speaker_A | Oh , do we have to tick our note thing again when we finish this ?"
[57:22] Speaker_D | Oh yeah . Absolutely .

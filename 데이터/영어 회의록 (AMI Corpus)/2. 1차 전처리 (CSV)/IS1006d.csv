[00:31] Speaker_A | Mm .
[01:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
[01:30] Speaker_A | see the prototype .
[01:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[01:32] Speaker_C | Uh , here we have our prototype model ."
[01:35] Speaker_A | Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm .
[01:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[01:35] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides ."
"[01:37] Speaker_B | Yes , and place some slides ."
"[01:40] Speaker_B | Uh , participant three ."
[01:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[01:47] Speaker_A | Mm okay . Mm .
[01:48] Speaker_C | Five .
[01:52] Speaker_C | Him .
[01:53] Speaker_B | this is our
[01:55] Speaker_B | remote control .
"[01:57] Speaker_B | It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide ."
[02:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[02:15] Speaker_B | We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um ,"
[02:32] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:33] Speaker_B | s society will accept that . For sure .
"[02:52] Speaker_B | But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m"
[03:01] Speaker_B | the modern material we can p select .
[03:06] Speaker_B | And it's practical .
"[03:09] Speaker_B | And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something ."
[03:20] Speaker_C | Experience . Explanat
[03:34] Speaker_D | Can I ? Ho-ho .
[04:05] Speaker_D | Ah .
[04:06] Speaker_B | That's all I wanted to say . Now it's technical specification by our
[04:08] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[04:12] Speaker_B | colleague .
[04:12] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[04:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[04:56] Speaker_C | And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action ."
[05:04] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:10] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[05:23] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[05:36] Speaker_D | Okay , that's good ."
"[05:42] Speaker_C | So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches ."
"[06:04] Speaker_D | Fruit smelling spongy titanium . I didn't know it exist , but that's great ."
"[06:15] Speaker_C | So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours ."
[06:31] Speaker_D | Ha .
[06:34] Speaker_A | Ho-ho .
[06:36] Speaker_D | You mean we can change the colour uh of th
[06:37] Speaker_A | That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
[06:40] Speaker_C | For the L_C_D_ .
"[06:40] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ ."
[06:42] Speaker_C | With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah .
[06:45] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
"[06:46] Speaker_D | Uh , okay ."
[06:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[06:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s"
[06:56] Speaker_D | Okay .
[06:59] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[07:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:11] Speaker_D | On the L_C_D_ ? Oh .
[07:11] Speaker_C | Huh ?
"[07:12] Speaker_C | Ah , these are like sensors ."
[07:17] Speaker_B | That's location sensors .
[07:23] Speaker_D | Very useful .
[07:23] Speaker_A | Okay . Strawberries .
[07:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:44] Speaker_B | Oops .
"[07:47] Speaker_D | So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm ."
[08:04] Speaker_A | Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ?
[08:14] Speaker_D | What a design .
[08:25] Speaker_D | the evaluation criterion .
[08:27] Speaker_A | Oops .
[08:32] Speaker_C | Fudge .
"[08:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . So , evaluation please ."
"[08:56] Speaker_D | Uh , next slide , please ."
"[09:22] Speaker_D | To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?"
[09:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:02] Speaker_C | Fancy .
"[10:02] Speaker_D | So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale"
[10:20] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[10:20] Speaker_D | from one to seven
[10:23] Speaker_D | with four in the middle .
[10:28] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[10:28] Speaker_D | So ,"
"[10:44] Speaker_D | Yeah , of course . What do you think ?"
[10:47] Speaker_B | Feel the weight .
[10:48] Speaker_D | The weight is later . Now we're We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
[10:49] Speaker_C | Yeah . Oh .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[10:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven ."
[10:57] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
"[10:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology ."
[10:59] Speaker_A | It's in the other . Yeah .
"[11:00] Speaker_C | Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay ."
[11:02] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[11:06] Speaker_A | Two . Let's say two , yeah ."
[11:06] Speaker_C | M maybe two .
[11:08] Speaker_B | Two . Two .
[11:11] Speaker_C | Technology .
"[11:16] Speaker_D | So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ ."
[11:21] Speaker_C | And we have L_C_D_ .
[11:24] Speaker_C | So you change colours .
[11:24] Speaker_A | Change colour of t
[11:28] Speaker_C | Useful .
"[11:29] Speaker_D | Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah ."
"[11:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[11:31] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
"[11:31] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . It's silly ."
[11:33] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
"[11:34] Speaker_D | Robustness , uh-huh ."
[11:47] Speaker_A | The strawberries Oh .
"[11:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , it Maybe strawberry ."
"[11:57] Speaker_B | No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry ."
[11:57] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[12:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , we can easily plug it ."
[12:05] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[12:07] Speaker_D | So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three .
[12:08] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
"[12:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:10] Speaker_A | Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah ."
[12:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?"
[12:15] Speaker_C | Useful ?
"[12:16] Speaker_D | Useful . Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce ."
"[12:25] Speaker_A | Oh , yeah , lets me try ."
[12:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[12:29] Speaker_A | What is uh next , please ?"
"[12:34] Speaker_D | Uh , it depends on the Okay ."
[12:35] Speaker_A | And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah .
"[12:42] Speaker_A | Okay , also ."
"[12:44] Speaker_D | So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly ."
"[12:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , um yeah ."
[12:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:50] Speaker_B | You can .
[12:52] Speaker_D | Directly .
"[12:52] Speaker_B | You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this ."
[12:54] Speaker_A | You c push here the the yeah .
[13:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:01] Speaker_D | Oh , it's a jog dial , okay ."
[13:06] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[13:06] Speaker_C | And channel .
[13:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:15] Speaker_C | You can select .
"[13:15] Speaker_B | You select twenty , you select five . That's it ."
[13:20] Speaker_C | Yeah mm .
"[13:21] Speaker_D | It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right ."
[13:22] Speaker_B | No .
"[13:27] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah ."
"[13:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm ."
"[13:40] Speaker_C | So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So"
[13:52] Speaker_D | Both .
[13:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:55] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[13:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .

[13:56] Speaker_D | Up down or left right . Yeah .
[13:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Up .
[13:57] Speaker_A | Yeah . And which what is that ?
"[14:00] Speaker_B | It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus ."
[14:00] Speaker_C | This is jog wheel .
[14:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:05] Speaker_C | Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one ."
[14:06] Speaker_D | Cool .
"[14:08] Speaker_A | Oh oh okay , great ."
[14:11] Speaker_A | Now it's looks us useful . Yeah .
[14:13] Speaker_D | Two or three ? Two or three ? Two .
[14:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:24] Speaker_D | Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ?"
"[14:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah ."
[14:39] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
"[14:39] Speaker_B | Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light ."
[14:43] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .

"[14:52] Speaker_C | But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm ."
"[14:53] Speaker_D | So , should be okay ."
"[14:56] Speaker_D | Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape ."
[14:58] Speaker_A | Mm-mm .
[15:00] Speaker_B | Okay . Okay .
[15:00] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[15:10] Speaker_D | Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . I think it's good . Okay ."
[15:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .

[16:20] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[16:30] Speaker_A | It's n no , it's not fancy any more ."
[16:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:42] Speaker_B | Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that ."
[16:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:55] Speaker_A | Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control ."

[21:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:16] Speaker_D | It's going to be expensive .
[21:17] Speaker_C | One scroll wheel . One L_C_D_
[21:21] Speaker_C | displayed .
[21:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:31] Speaker_D | That's all ? No .
"[21:31] Speaker_A | That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one ."
[21:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:34] Speaker_D | Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay ."
"[21:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's cheaper ."
[21:38] Speaker_A | Or only a scroll-wheel .
[21:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:40] Speaker_C | Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm .
"[21:53] Speaker_D | No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ?"

[23:08] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Mm .
"[23:22] Speaker_D | if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker ."
[23:26] Speaker_C | Sample speaker . Yeah .
"[23:30] Speaker_A | Apparently , we have to choose one or the other ."
[23:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:36] Speaker_B | Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy ."
"[23:45] Speaker_B | So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy"
[23:52] Speaker_A | But you don't need a battery ? Mm .
"[23:52] Speaker_B | to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot ."
[23:55] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[23:59] Speaker_B | A real high-tech version of it .
"[24:02] Speaker_A | But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ?"
[24:06] Speaker_C | Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
"[24:08] Speaker_D | So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that ."
"[24:12] Speaker_B | Okay , but l"
[24:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:13] Speaker_A | Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay .

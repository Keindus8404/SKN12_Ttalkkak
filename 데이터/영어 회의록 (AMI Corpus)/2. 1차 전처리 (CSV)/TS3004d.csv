[00:06] Speaker_A | Oh .
[00:07] Speaker_B | It's not saved yet .
[00:08] Speaker_C | Okay .
[00:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:26] Speaker_B | Our beautiful drawing .
[00:41] Speaker_A | So this is our agenda . You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
[00:48] Speaker_D | Oops .
[00:51] Speaker_C | Okay .
[00:53] Speaker_A | Uh I didn't Oh yeah .
"[01:01] Speaker_C | Oh , okay . Yeah ."
"[01:04] Speaker_A | So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report ."
[01:18] Speaker_B | Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
"[01:25] Speaker_A | Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay ."
[01:30] Speaker_B | Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
"[01:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know ."
[01:44] Speaker_A | Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
[01:45] Speaker_C | It's probably better .
"[01:48] Speaker_C | Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions ."
[01:52] Speaker_A | Maybe that's better .
[01:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[01:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's that's a very good point ."
"[01:55] Speaker_B | Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it ."
[01:56] Speaker_C | Think that's better .
[02:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[02:17] Speaker_B | Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
"[02:19] Speaker_C | Yeah , I I think so . I don't know ."
[02:23] Speaker_C | Ah okay .
[02:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
[02:25] Speaker_A | So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
[02:28] Speaker_B | Good .
[02:37] Speaker_A | So you can show your prototype if you want to .
[02:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:42] Speaker_B | Together ?
"[02:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's Let's do it together . Okay ."
[02:45] Speaker_B | I'll give comments .
"[02:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , we just made a Word file"
[02:54] Speaker_C | with the basic
[02:56] Speaker_C | elements .
"[03:02] Speaker_C | Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . Uh the material should be hard plastic ."
[03:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[03:19] Speaker_C | Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements ."
"[03:36] Speaker_C | The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . And this is the"
"[03:50] Speaker_C | the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic ."
[03:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:04] Speaker_A | Mm .
[04:06] Speaker_A | So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
[04:10] Speaker_B | Speech recognition .
"[04:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , speech recognition . Just Only one button to say it's on or off ."
[04:17] Speaker_C | Uh I dunno .
"[04:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it ."
"[04:25] Speaker_B | Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore ."
[04:30] Speaker_A | So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
"[04:31] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure ."
"[04:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad ."
[04:35] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:35] Speaker_D | Okay .
[04:45] Speaker_B | You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
"[04:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , you can put it separate ."
[04:49] Speaker_B | You Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room .
[04:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:56] Speaker_C | Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so ."
"[05:00] Speaker_B | Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central ."
"[05:04] Speaker_B | That was the the most important thing . So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find ."
"[05:19] Speaker_B | Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's"
[05:27] Speaker_B | will uh will show up .
"[05:30] Speaker_B | Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know ."
"[05:37] Speaker_C | Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then ."
[05:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:45] Speaker_D | Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
[05:55] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
[05:56] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . It's uh twelve buttons .
"[05:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[06:14] Speaker_B | I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular ."
[06:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:36] Speaker_B | So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling ."
"[06:40] Speaker_B | Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons ."
"[06:49] Speaker_B | Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it ."
[07:02] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[07:03] Speaker_B | And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it ."
"[07:08] Speaker_A | And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? How do you want to implement that ? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ?"
[07:08] Speaker_B | So when you pre
[07:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:18] Speaker_D | Ah .
"[07:22] Speaker_A | Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well ."
[07:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[07:41] Speaker_D | Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions ."
"[07:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , I um To your video device ."
[07:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:58] Speaker_B | Is i Ah okay .
[08:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:01] Speaker_D | And h how does the second level come out ? Uh it slides uh along ?
[08:02] Speaker_A | Just uh if you s
[08:04] Speaker_B | Um slides I think . It's
"[08:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , y Maybe , yeah ."
[08:06] Speaker_D | From from the uh beneath ?
[08:07] Speaker_A | For the bottom .
"[08:07] Speaker_B | You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed ."
"[08:10] Speaker_A | No , you gotta slide it ."
"[08:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's right ."
[08:19] Speaker_C | So what do we need ?
[08:20] Speaker_B | Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
[08:27] Speaker_D | Menu ?
[08:29] Speaker_B | Menu button .
[08:31] Speaker_B | With uh maybe uh arrows .
[08:34] Speaker_B | So you can uh
"[08:36] Speaker_B | scroll in the , navigate the menu ."
[08:42] Speaker_C | God damn it .
[08:42] Speaker_D | Scart ?
[08:50] Speaker_D | Uh yeah .
"[09:01] Speaker_B | If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day ."
[09:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:06] Speaker_C | Extern or something .
[09:15] Speaker_A | You want to save that file as well ?
[09:19] Speaker_A | The drawing ?
[09:23] Speaker_B | That was it .
"[09:23] Speaker_C | So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many ."
[09:28] Speaker_C | I don't know the functions . Okay . What else ?
[09:29] Speaker_B | It doesn't really matter . That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .
[09:34] Speaker_C | What else ?
[09:36] Speaker_C | Uh menu .
"[09:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , to navigate ."
[09:38] Speaker_C | Uh With arrows .
[09:39] Speaker_B | S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do .
[09:48] Speaker_B | Or there .
[09:50] Speaker_B | Like on the normal uh Like this .
"[09:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . Okay ."
"[09:53] Speaker_B | The menu button , yes ."
"[09:57] Speaker_B | Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it ."
[10:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:09] Speaker_D | Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
[10:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:12] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[10:13] Speaker_D | Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons ."
[10:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[10:17] Speaker_B | Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?"
"[10:27] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that ."
"[10:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[10:30] Speaker_A | That's that's very easy , yeah ."
[10:32] Speaker_C | We can put those here .
"[10:34] Speaker_D | Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay ."
[10:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:40] Speaker_B | Yep .
[10:48] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:57] Speaker_C | So did we miss anything ?
"[11:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume ."
[11:02] Speaker_D | Some text uh buttons .
[11:05] Speaker_C | Okay .
[11:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:07] Speaker_D | Yeah , but"
[11:08] Speaker_B | I just uh The volume logo .
[11:11] Speaker_C | Oh wh Here ?
[11:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:13] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[11:15] Speaker_D | There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Do you do you Did you think of that ?"
"[11:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , we have that on the the text button ."
[11:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:29] Speaker_C | Yep .
[11:34] Speaker_B | Uh why not ?
"[11:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well ."
[11:38] Speaker_D | Ex Yeah . Yeah .
"[11:40] Speaker_C | Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the"
"[11:45] Speaker_B | I think um Yeah , the three stages . Yes ."
"[11:46] Speaker_A | Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay ."
"[11:47] Speaker_C | through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first ."
[11:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:54] Speaker_B | No , it doesn't have to turn it off ."
[11:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:04] Speaker_A | Yes , that's to remember ."
"[12:11] Speaker_C | Okay , okay ."
"[12:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah ."
[12:19] Speaker_D | Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
"[12:21] Speaker_C | Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on ."
"[12:31] Speaker_B | Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the"
[12:32] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , but you have to search every time again . That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that ."
[12:35] Speaker_C | Th i
[12:35] Speaker_B | the chip .
"[12:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's true ."
"[12:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno . Okay ."
[12:45] Speaker_D | Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
"[12:45] Speaker_A | No , that's what the television does ."
"[12:50] Speaker_C | Yeah , those memory functions ."
[12:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Okay .
"[12:57] Speaker_A | Okay , it's cool ."
"[12:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's fine ."
[13:05] Speaker_C | So that's it ?
"[13:06] Speaker_A | Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?"
"[13:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?"
"[13:14] Speaker_B | Just like your telephone , hard plastic ."
"[13:17] Speaker_D | Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?"
[13:18] Speaker_A | It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
"[13:35] Speaker_B | I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space ."
[13:41] Speaker_D | Well yeah . That's too much place .
"[13:45] Speaker_D | Okay , just leave it . Just leave it ."
[13:45] Speaker_B | I don't think the space is worth it .
"[13:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , and i"
[13:47] Speaker_C | I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
[13:55] Speaker_D | Okay . Fine .
"[13:56] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Okay , cool ."
[14:07] Speaker_A | Mm mm mm mm mm .
"[14:11] Speaker_A | Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one ."
"[14:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . That shall show it ."
"[14:16] Speaker_A | Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool ."
[14:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:30] Speaker_A | You have some usability criteria or Okay .
[14:41] Speaker_D | Oh .
[14:41] Speaker_C | In the bottom .
[14:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:45] Speaker_A | Look-and-feel ?
[14:46] Speaker_D | Evaluation crit
"[14:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , evaluation presentation ."
[14:53] Speaker_D | It's not in .
[14:57] Speaker_D | Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something .
[15:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:02] Speaker_D | Yes . Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . The LEDs ."
[16:02] Speaker_B | Mm .
[16:13] Speaker_A | Flashy .
[16:27] Speaker_C | Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
[16:32] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
"[16:36] Speaker_B | Um basic colours , um yeah . Well you didn't say . Maybe um company colours ?"
[16:42] Speaker_A | It's black .
[16:43] Speaker_B | Black .
[16:45] Speaker_B | A bit a bit of yellow .
"[16:47] Speaker_B | Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow ."
"[16:51] Speaker_D | Black white , maybe ?"
"[16:53] Speaker_B | Like white , also ni or uh always nice ."
[16:56] Speaker_C | And what colours should the buttons be ?
"[17:02] Speaker_A | Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it ."
"[17:06] Speaker_C | But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?"
[17:06] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[17:08] Speaker_A | No , no . Make them No , just make them black or grey or something ."
"[17:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think ."
[17:14] Speaker_C | Okay .
[17:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:16] Speaker_D | Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours ."
"[17:28] Speaker_D | Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful ."
[17:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:36] Speaker_B | It's hard to decide for us , but yeah ."
[17:37] Speaker_C | Yeah . It's ju so subjective .
[17:39] Speaker_B | It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
[17:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:46] Speaker_D | A two . Okay .
[17:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:02] Speaker_C | One more thing . Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? Yeah ?
[18:11] Speaker_D | Slide panel ?
[18:12] Speaker_B | Mm . Not needed .
"[18:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , not needed I think ."
[18:17] Speaker_C | And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
"[18:18] Speaker_D | Oh , you mean th this here ?"
"[18:18] Speaker_A | That as well , yeah ."
[18:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , but that's unnecessary ."
[18:22] Speaker_B | What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
"[18:24] Speaker_D | It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable ."
[18:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:45] Speaker_A | No . Yeah .
[18:49] Speaker_B | To light it all up .
[18:50] Speaker_A | But Yeah . Mayb Okay .
"[18:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey ."
[18:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:01] Speaker_D | Okay .
[19:01] Speaker_B | Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .
"[19:04] Speaker_A | Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right ."
[19:04] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[19:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's how I think ."
"[19:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , this It is a one . It's okay . It's cool ."
[19:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:19] Speaker_D | I think it's one .
"[19:22] Speaker_D | Okay , next . Learnable ? Easy to use ?"
[19:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:34] Speaker_C | No , but you don't have to use that . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it ."
[19:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:40] Speaker_A | No .
"[19:44] Speaker_D | Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re"
"[19:49] Speaker_C | Well , I think it is ."
[19:49] Speaker_B | Well y just uh f
"[20:03] Speaker_A | But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n"
"[20:05] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does ."
[20:07] Speaker_C | So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
[20:09] Speaker_B | Yes .
[20:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:14] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[20:14] Speaker_B | But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn ."
"[20:19] Speaker_A | So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device ."
[20:19] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[20:30] Speaker_D | Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it ."
[20:31] Speaker_B | Device .
[20:51] Speaker_D | And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . Because easy to use comes after learnable . I I think it a three or something .
[20:53] Speaker_A | But yeah .
[20:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[20:59] Speaker_A | Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two ."
"[21:05] Speaker_A | No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah ."
[21:05] Speaker_C | Mm uh .
[21:09] Speaker_B | Yeah okay . Yeah .
"[21:14] Speaker_B | Yep , true ."
[21:16] Speaker_B | Then a two .
[21:16] Speaker_D | Oh . Okay . New features . Techno technological innovative ?
[21:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:23] Speaker_C | The speech function and the colour . Colour .
"[21:25] Speaker_B | And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide ."
"[21:31] Speaker_D | Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control ."
[21:34] Speaker_A | Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . So that's not new . Yeah .
[21:36] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:39] Speaker_B | But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Okay ."
"[21:42] Speaker_D | Okay , and the the the lightning ? Is that new ? The lighting's new . Scrollwheel . Speech ?"
[21:44] Speaker_A | That's cool . Yeah for a Uh for a f
"[21:46] Speaker_C | Mm it's pretty new , I think ."
[21:47] Speaker_B | Yes .
[21:50] Speaker_C | Speech is new .
"[21:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too ."
[21:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:58] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:02] Speaker_D | It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
"[22:09] Speaker_A | Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable ."
[22:09] Speaker_D | Uh-oh .
[22:11] Speaker_D | Home-station .
[22:11] Speaker_B | We don't recharge .
[22:14] Speaker_B | But that's more like uh now .
"[22:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing ."
[22:19] Speaker_B | I don't know .
"[22:20] Speaker_A | If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?"
"[22:26] Speaker_B | Just save , save as ?"
[22:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . Mm-hmm .
"[22:31] Speaker_A | Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project ."
[22:34] Speaker_C | Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .
"[22:37] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Yeah , but this one ."
[22:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:38] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:41] Speaker_A | This one is not yet in the Oh oh .
[22:44] Speaker_C | I think it is .
"[22:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , it is ."
"[22:48] Speaker_C | No , I think it is ."
"[22:50] Speaker_B | Uh untitled ? Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save ."
[22:56] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[22:56] Speaker_D | Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven ."
"[23:09] Speaker_A | No , just so it's still a two ."
"[23:09] Speaker_C | Mm two , I think ."
[23:12] Speaker_A | Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ?
"[23:19] Speaker_A | Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group ."
"[23:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question ."
[23:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:36] Speaker_C | We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So"
[23:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:41] Speaker_D | Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
[23:42] Speaker_C | think that's a two or a one .
"[23:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , this . So we targeted it ?"
[24:03] Speaker_D | But we didn't follow the latest trends .
[24:07] Speaker_C | No .
"[24:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , you could make a a front"
[24:09] Speaker_B | Mm . I think we followed the latest trends .
"[24:12] Speaker_C | a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something ."
[24:13] Speaker_D | Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer .
"[24:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , you get different colours ."
[24:24] Speaker_C | Like a a f banana kind of front .
[24:30] Speaker_C | No .

[24:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:35] Speaker_A | Oh .
[24:37] Speaker_D | Okay .
[24:38] Speaker_A | So that's eleven .
[24:44] Speaker_D | What's the average ?
[24:45] Speaker_C | Eleven divided by six .
"[24:53] Speaker_D | A perfect score . No , I don't know ."
[24:58] Speaker_B | This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .
[25:02] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[25:04] Speaker_D | And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep ."
[25:04] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[25:10] Speaker_C | Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep ."
"[25:13] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one ."
[25:13] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[25:16] Speaker_B | No no , I want that in ."
[25:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[25:24] Speaker_B | Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?"
"[25:27] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."

[25:41] Speaker_D | I did save it .
[25:51] Speaker_A | No .
"[25:54] Speaker_A | Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me ."
[26:12] Speaker_C | Mm okay .
[26:17] Speaker_A | So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
[26:21] Speaker_C | Okay .
[26:22] Speaker_A | So that's both .
"[26:23] Speaker_D | Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three ."
"[26:25] Speaker_A | Yeah , and single curved curved ."
"[26:31] Speaker_A | No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be ."
"[26:36] Speaker_A | Probably . I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure ."
"[26:44] Speaker_B | Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah ."
[26:48] Speaker_A | See it's I think it's okay like this .
"[26:51] Speaker_A | It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all ."
[26:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:03] Speaker_A | So you can put a recharger in it as well . But this is expensive , the sample speaker ."
[27:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:11] Speaker_B | This ?
[27:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's four ."
[27:12] Speaker_D | Four . It's four Euros .
"[27:15] Speaker_B | Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it ."
"[27:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's included ."
"[27:26] Speaker_A | Yeah , no . Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this ."
[27:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:32] Speaker_B | Damn , solar cells are uh expensive ."
"[27:34] Speaker_A | So I just want you Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh"
[27:45] Speaker_A | for everything together .
[27:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
[27:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
[27:56] Speaker_A | We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?
[28:03] Speaker_C | Sure .
[28:06] Speaker_D | Yes .
[28:13] Speaker_B | Okay .
[28:26] Speaker_C | Yeah m If we got a high mark for um
[28:30] Speaker_C | uh innovativeness or innovativity
[28:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:35] Speaker_D | Or a different style .
[28:35] Speaker_C | then there we probably have been creative .
[28:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:41] Speaker_D | We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity .
[28:49] Speaker_C | Huh .
[29:03] Speaker_B | Of course there was .
[29:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:07] Speaker_A | What do you have to say about that ?
"[29:08] Speaker_C | No , I think Yeah ."
[29:10] Speaker_A | I dunno .
[29:17] Speaker_C | one leader or something .
[29:19] Speaker_B | One leader to
"[29:21] Speaker_B | check the time , etcetera ."

[29:29] Speaker_B | So more like a secretary .
[29:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:45] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah . We were not finished .
[29:49] Speaker_D | Uh .
"[29:52] Speaker_B | Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker ."
[29:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , th that's weird ."
"[30:07] Speaker_D | Yeah , because"
[30:15] Speaker_C | Hmm hmm yeah .

[30:19] Speaker_C | So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
[30:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:25] Speaker_A | But the teamwork was okay .
[30:31] Speaker_B | I think uh everyone listen to each other . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
[30:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:41] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[30:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . No ."
[30:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:54] Speaker_B | It was Just doesn't work . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Just not work too slow . Yeah , more accurate ."
"[31:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great ."
"[31:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think ."
"[31:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate ."
[31:10] Speaker_D | Precise .
[31:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:13] Speaker_B | And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting ."
[31:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:19] Speaker_B | Not just pointing out on it .
[31:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:27] Speaker_C | Yeah , and p just point with a mouse ."
[31:34] Speaker_B | No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .
[31:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:39] Speaker_C | Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
[31:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , like ."
"[31:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style ."
[31:49] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[31:52] Speaker_C | And it's far too slow this way .
[31:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[31:56] Speaker_B | You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function ."
[32:00] Speaker_C | No .
[32:03] Speaker_D | Digital pen .
[32:09] Speaker_A | So we made it in time . And we made a remote control .
"[32:16] Speaker_A | In the budget , yeah ."
[32:18] Speaker_B | New ideas found .
[32:22] Speaker_D | New ideas .
[32:24] Speaker_C | What's that ?
"[32:31] Speaker_D | To gather , or to uh"

"[32:43] Speaker_B | For remote control , a favourite for your text ."
[32:50] Speaker_C | Hmm .

[00:14] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
"[00:16] Speaker_A | Can you just remind me , I don't have to tick the no n okay thing until I finish writing , but it's only if I go back to it I tick okay again ."
[00:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[00:25] Speaker_A | Mm .
[00:26] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[00:27] Speaker_B | So if you've um if you're back to a page , then you tick it again to leave it for the second time ."
"[00:42] Speaker_A | So if I'm working o if I've done a page , I'm on the second page , I tick it so um I finish that page and I go back to this , I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again . Yeah , so it's always after , n you never have to it before . Fine . Fine ."
[00:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[00:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[01:03] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:03] Speaker_B | I don't believe all this stuff . It's just amazing .
[01:09] Speaker_A | And you can go on both sides as well .
"[01:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , right . Where should we start ? What have we got ?"
[01:27] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:28] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[01:31] Speaker_B | Right .
"[01:40] Speaker_C | Yeah , right ."
"[01:50] Speaker_A | by Trying to think , what is it Thursday today , I'll d I'll do that by the end of the week anyway ."
"[01:58] Speaker_B | And um you're gonna was it your idea to stick the bit in it where you say um uh , you know , you're we're inviting like from quite a wide audience we give priority to linguists ?"
[02:09] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[02:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , we're gonna do that , but I think we should s probably send out um separate calls , okay . So we'll send one , but weren't men I mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people , but I think it will probably just uh I mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there . We can mention it , but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that , you know , they're gonna lose their place or whatever , because uh I don't know ."
[02:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[02:42] Speaker_A | But we do we do have to decide a priority thing , so that's something else we can look at um a little bit"
[02:51] Speaker_A | later down the line . So so that's the one for ling basically and I'll send that out .
[02:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:05] Speaker_A | I'll do that today or tomorrow .
"[03:18] Speaker_A | Psychology people , probably that's I reckon it's the best thing to do . 'Cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else . So um"
[03:25] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[03:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[03:29] Speaker_A | if one of us could email Claire .
[03:32] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[03:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , when in doubt ."
[03:51] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[03:51] Speaker_A | we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know , so she gets the dates right ."
[03:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:06] Speaker_A | And uh um she's I know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycho-linguistics basically . So that's fine .
[04:11] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[04:15] Speaker_B | And that should kinda take care of itself as well . If she just sends one round around to everyone , then only the psycho-linguists will say what was for me ."
[04:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , exactly . Exactly ."
[04:40] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[04:43] Speaker_C | I think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt . That's always quite helpful .
[04:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[04:56] Speaker_C | Yep .
[04:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[05:03] Speaker_A | No , they won't be . I just th the only thing I'm thinking is I want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them , that they don't go oh , we're just getting rubbish from y you know what I mean . I want them to really know that it's addressed to them . Um and the good thing about Claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it it might look a bit more relevant to them ."
"[05:15] Speaker_B | Right , yeah ."
[05:15] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[05:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[05:44] Speaker_A | um the basis for her email , but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them , et cetera . ."
[05:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[05:53] Speaker_A | Um and obviously in P_P_L_S_ we've also got English language . Now
"[06:00] Speaker_A | in a way we could send out that first call to them , just as part of the same email , because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them . I don't really know . I don't really know what you think about that . But um I think we definitely should open it up to English language . Um I think particularly at the moment , 'cause they're really trying to sort of uh merge us into one subject area , even though it should be meaningless , because we're all part of a school , I think that it does actually make a difference . And so I think we should invite them , but then we've still got the problem of uh a priority issue . So , you know , probably what I was thinking is um certainly second and third-years absolutely need to be uh top on top priority . But then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first-years , because they don't need to . If they want to , should they have priority ?"
[06:11] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[06:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:59] Speaker_A | This is a kind of lower point but uh it kind of it crosses over with deciding
[07:10] Speaker_B | Well do we have um a d an idea of how many people were gonna
[07:16] Speaker_B | actually have at the whole thing ? Any kind of because then it because seems to me it could be quite obvious . Then we just subtract the number of second and third year students and then everything else is just I'd I would favour doing it just on a first come first serve basis .
[07:21] Speaker_C | I don't think so .
"[07:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
[07:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
[07:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:38] Speaker_B | But I mean if we're like so , mean , we were gonna do this thing for um I can't even remember , was it two or three days ?"
[07:39] Speaker_C | See if we have to put on some restraints .
[07:47] Speaker_B | Okay . And so how many how many posters and talks are we gonna actually gonna get in ?
[07:53] Speaker_C | Let's see .
[07:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:59] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[08:09] Speaker_B | If you do two in a row then that's an hour , isn't it ?"
[08:11] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[08:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:14] Speaker_B | and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps .
[08:18] Speaker_C | Mm .
[08:21] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[08:33] Speaker_C | I'm thinking uh slots of one and a half hour each . So three lectures each , that would be uh three per day times three will be twenty seven ."
[08:47] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[08:51] Speaker_C | Once in the morning , twice in the afternoon ."
"[08:55] Speaker_A | Oh , so just have an hour and a half in the morning ."
[08:57] Speaker_C | Yeah . I mean or twice in the morning once in the afternoon .
"[08:59] Speaker_A | 'Cause I mean would six hours a day be pushing it ? Not necessarily , because I mean the good think is n"
[09:06] Speaker_B | Would we get that many people wanting to give talks ?
"[09:10] Speaker_A | Well I suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right , what's the maximum we can do ? So I think that's about as much as we could do , to have an hour and a half , then have a coffee break , then have an hour and a half , then have lunch , hour and a half , coffee break , hour and a half . And so that would be eighteen hours of talks overall , wouldn't it ? But what do we say ? So it's th so it's twelve thirty six talks , is that right ? Maximum thirty six ."
[09:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[09:44] Speaker_A | Okay , let's just put this down ."
[09:59] Speaker_B | How many second and third year
[10:02] Speaker_B | um students are there ?
"[10:22] Speaker_B | Right , okay ."
"[10:25] Speaker_A | Um but a good number of them are first-years , and I don't know I mean just to get an idea , are you planning on talking ? No . Are you planning , Robert ? And I'm probably not . So there's a good chance that almost none of the first-years are gonna volunteer . Um so"
[10:32] Speaker_B | No .
[10:33] Speaker_C | No .
[10:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[10:45] Speaker_A | if we had say twenty linguistics and even then , I mean there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever . So , you know , it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway , and then we could be left with uh fifteen blocks for um the rest of P_P_L_S_ ."
"[11:10] Speaker_A | So at least we know that that we've got an absolute limit of about thirty-six talks , yeah ?"
[11:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[11:32] Speaker_B | We're also gonna be having posters , aren't we . And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk ."
"[11:36] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . And that's that's what uh the coffee breaks will be for , and maybe lunchtimes . But coffee breaks are probably more like ab or are gonna be a better time , because people will hang around , whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch , aren't they ?"
[11:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[11:53] Speaker_B | Uh yeah . But w wouldn't we want to actually just like dedicate an afternoon or a morning to being a poster session ?
"[11:59] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's what I was about to say , poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it . Actually"
[12:01] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:13] Speaker_C | there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters . But let's see about that .
"[12:19] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah . But um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out themsel that sort that out themselves . Um I mean it's the thing about posters , unless you kind of say , you know , if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't ."
[12:25] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[12:25] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:31] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[12:42] Speaker_B | I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon .
"[12:46] Speaker_B | I mean the ju just because like ones that I've been to as well , um"
[12:52] Speaker_B | people tend to kinda come and go from them .
[12:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[12:58] Speaker_B | I don't know , I mean I I I'd say a whole either a whole morning or a whole afternoon um at least . But that's just ju I mean just based on the ones that I've been to ."
[13:03] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:06] Speaker_A | So that means we could have thirty talks .
[13:13] Speaker_A | uh one A_M_ or P_M_ of posters .
[13:18] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[13:18] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:26] Speaker_B | At least six .
"[13:29] Speaker_A | At least six posters , if you see what I mean . During the session , like how many can you have going on at once ?"
"[13:31] Speaker_B | Oh right . Okay , yeah , yeah ."
"[13:35] Speaker_B | Um well that's just kind of dictated by the size of the room really , isn't it ? Yeah . I mean would we have poster boards or is it just gonna be posters on the walls ?"
[13:45] Speaker_B | They did it like um I ha I should have found this out . Are you guys second years or first years ? You're both first year . So n so none of us have been to this before . Right .
[13:46] Speaker_C | Do we have any information on this ?
[13:49] Speaker_A | First years .
[13:50] Speaker_C | First years .
[13:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[14:04] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[14:07] Speaker_C | Actually , we have a message here from Mits about the poster session . Poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference . In two thousand it was held separately in October . The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post-grad students to the department's research culture . However , I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging ."
[14:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:31] Speaker_C | On the other hand , I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience . My suggestion therefore is to re-examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it ."
"[14:45] Speaker_A | Well , I think keeping it"
[14:50] Speaker_C | Mm .
[14:52] Speaker_C | Yeah . Last sentence . One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster .
"[14:59] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think so ."
[15:02] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[15:13] Speaker_A | What would it be at the beginning ? So I suppose it is it normally uh second years do it like just after they've come back for the s
[15:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[15:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[15:25] Speaker_A | That's what it would be , I think ."
[15:33] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[15:33] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I d I don't think he means that it would be"
"[15:38] Speaker_A | the first-years who've only just arrived would do a poster . That would be a bit odd , wouldn't it ?"
"[15:41] Speaker_B | Oh no no no no yeah , yeah ."
[15:45] Speaker_C | But a poster I might do .
"[15:59] Speaker_A | we've got an idea . I think there's thirty talks and and say six , ten posters , whatever we can manage to fit in the room . Um so we need to look at we need to look at where we're gonna ho hold it . We could have it in B_ nine , but there's things all over the wall ."
[16:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[16:17] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[16:18] Speaker_A | There are those pictures that run all the way around , so can we take the pictures down ? Can we use B_ nine for the posters for instance ?"
"[16:24] Speaker_B | Um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards , if there are some poster boards that we can get ahold of , then that's"
[16:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[16:32] Speaker_B | alright .
"[16:32] Speaker_A | Okay , so poster boards . And wha uh um what I'll do , I'll email Mits about that , okay ?"
[16:38] Speaker_B | Okay .
[16:39] Speaker_C | Um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session .
[16:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[16:49] Speaker_C | So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk . But the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session , how does it work out with the talks ."
"[16:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[17:01] Speaker_A | Okay .
[17:11] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[17:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[17:20] Speaker_B | Mm .
[17:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[17:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . Yep . Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_B | Mm .
[17:34] Speaker_C | Yep .
[17:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
"[18:04] Speaker_A | Okay , so we got some sort of idea of"
[18:08] Speaker_A | the structure and how many talks we're going to be able to have .
"[18:14] Speaker_B | Well the maximum . I mean I guess that that will evolve uh when we get a response from people , perhaps . But that's fine , isn't it ? So we've got three days ."
[18:15] Speaker_A | I mean w
"[18:19] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . So I've uh Okay , so English language um we'll put on the main call , and I'll just I I'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and English language or something like that , I think ."
[18:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:37] Speaker_B | And is the the other main group then um philosophy ?
"[18:41] Speaker_A | Yes , and Informatics , we could think about it as well ."
[18:43] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[18:48] Speaker_A | So I had a look
"[18:51] Speaker_A | at whether they do philosophy of a language and logic and stuff here , and they kind of do . There's about there's about three or four uh full-time members of staff that list um philosophy of language as a major interest , so chances are they're gonna have some P_H_D_ students that uh are interested . So"
[18:57] Speaker_C | I think they do .
[19:05] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:13] Speaker_A | do we think we should invite them ? I think I'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them . I think that would be
[19:21] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:22] Speaker_C | Still Yeah .
[19:22] Speaker_A | amazing if we did . So I think it's probably worth I don't think we're gonna get inundated with requests . So I think it's worth asking them .
[19:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:36] Speaker_A | I mean I think the Informatics are definitely worth asking . Uh th there's there's C_S_T_R_ and um H_C_R_C_ .
[19:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:48] Speaker_B | Mm . I mean I'm thinking that the Informatics
[19:52] Speaker_B | potentially is quite a big response .
[19:54] Speaker_A | Yes .
[19:56] Speaker_A | It is .
"[19:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , might be interesting stuff coming in . Read something recently about"
[20:02] Speaker_C | I think somebody's Masters project to look in how far English is actu uh or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages .
[20:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:24] Speaker_B | Would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like provisor in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively
"[20:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , well it would be nice to that . It would be nice it would be nice to do it . The thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense , because it's such a Because of the way our department is , then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds . In fact , even by inviting um people from um Informatics and from or maybe from Philosophy and things , it might bias it in a particular direction . But I don't know , it's probably not too bad . I I think that I think that between Philosophy , Informatics and um Psychology you've probably got quite a lot of breadth there anyway . Um the thing is"
[20:39] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[20:46] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:48] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[21:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[21:20] Speaker_A | uh the one thing is the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics are the applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language . And I don't think we'd be inviting them . But I don't think that's too bad , because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in P_P_L_S_ , because we are in one school . And then the fact that we also invite people from the Informatics , I suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them , and I don't think anyone would be too offended . I hope not anyway . Um"
[21:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[21:59] Speaker_A | so yeah . So what kind of provisor can we put on ? I mean we could
[22:03] Speaker_A | we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year .
[22:12] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[22:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , let's just do that . That's seems most straight-forward . Yeah , just So so if you just send them a general thing saying the Linguistics Department's having this conference and would like to invite post-graduates from the Informatics ."
[22:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:29] Speaker_A | So you're going to email Claire . Um
[22:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:35] Speaker_A | so who wants to send something out to Informatics ?
[22:39] Speaker_B | I'll do that . That's fine . And should I get in touch with Philosophy as well ?
[22:40] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Alright .
"[22:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language , um but put a warning that if it's logic , then there's a good chance that no one will understand , or not that many . I mean maybe just maybe if you just put"
[23:05] Speaker_B | No one will understand .
"[23:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , just put philosophy of language . That's that's probably good . Or just or any ph"
[23:18] Speaker_C | Or some
"[23:28] Speaker_A | Yep . Yeah , that's it . That's what you do . Yeah , that I think that's as much as we need to say . That's right . So uh you've gotta work out how to do that and who to email ."
"[23:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Kind of a relevance clause ."
[23:37] Speaker_B | Basically what I was thinking was um just sending them your call for papers and ch changing it slightly to say dear Philosophy students .
"[23:44] Speaker_A | Mm . Yeah , that's fine , that's fine . That's what you wanna do . Um as long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that"
[24:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:38] Speaker_B | Mm mm .
[24:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:07] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:11] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[25:12] Speaker_B | Oh I see , right , he wants them there because he so he can make it . Okay ."
[25:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . So and the other thing is um when we get some calls say we have
[25:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:58] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah , yeah ."
[26:02] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[26:04] Speaker_A | As much as possible anyway .
"[26:10] Speaker_C | So far it's just a general statement of interest , what we intend to do . What we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff ."
[26:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[26:30] Speaker_A | what should we say ? Something like 'cause we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts . So let's set the the latest deadline , the the uh the the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting , and that's gonna be when all the real work starts ."
[26:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[26:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:58] Speaker_C | End of March .
"[27:00] Speaker_A | End of March might be okay . Uh I'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of April . And then I'm coming back just in time for the conference . So any organising , at least stuff where I need to be where we need to meet physically has to be done before that ."
[27:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:09] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:17] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[27:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , and I will be away"
[27:31] Speaker_C | to get the stuff done .
[27:42] Speaker_A | I'm trying to get this right . Hopefully I'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before . 'Cause I think I'm gonna be back .
"[27:51] Speaker_A | Might even have to come in in the evening . But that's not the end of the world , but we might have to set some things up . Like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever . We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready . And there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready . So not only is there a pressure to have uh"
[27:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[28:15] Speaker_A | talks that are on a similar topic together , but also if people need the same kind of computer set-up , it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it . So Because I th I think it was Cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do . But he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and and get it ready for them ."
[28:23] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[28:35] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[28:38] Speaker_B | What kinds of things do you think people are actually gonna need ?
"[28:41] Speaker_A | Well , hopefully most people will d either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have uh P_D_F_ slides or something . Hopefully , no one will have anything too specialized . S sh z"
[28:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:55] Speaker_C | In my experience what you usually should have is some kind of um , what's it , over-head thingo um beamer . In some cases we might if it's really tough , we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings ."
[29:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:14] Speaker_B | I mean if we do it uh th hasn't B_ nine got all of that ?
"[29:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's got a lot in there . But I think it does take a little bit of I mean uh I think sometimes maybe people need to be in Linux rather than Windows and so booting in and out"
"[29:17] Speaker_C | Should be there , yeah ."
[29:21] Speaker_C | Adjusting .
[29:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[29:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[29:34] Speaker_A | But I think what we should say is when I put out this call , I'll put both deadlines , and I think I'll say that when you send in your abstract , you need to mention that any technology you intend to use , so that at least if we have all the information Yeah ? So um so deadlines . Um , okay so let's think about this . If if we gave them a whole month or just over a month , then"
[29:45] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[29:48] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[30:05] Speaker_A | Oh no , it wouldn't be okay at all . If we gave them the whole month , that'd give us hardly any time . So if we gave them say till mid-March , that would be good . So give them something like give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in , and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done . And the abstract doesn't have to be much , it's probably only half a side of A_ four or something , isn't it ? Just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into . That's all we really need ."
[30:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[30:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:32] Speaker_B | Mm .
[30:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[30:47] Speaker_C | Nah . No way anymore .
[30:57] Speaker_C | Mm neither do I .
"[31:24] Speaker_A | Thirty one oh no , it's twenty eight this"
"[31:28] Speaker_A | this month , isn't it ?"
[31:29] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[31:30] Speaker_A | Two , three , four ."
[31:39] Speaker_C | I could create us another calendar .
"[31:39] Speaker_A | So if we have it like a Monday , Monday the fourteenth'd probably be quite good for the final deadline . And then um if I send it out tomorrow , we'll say something like the el"
[31:47] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[31:59] Speaker_C | For the title deadline ? Yeah .
[32:08] Speaker_A | Does that sound reasonable ?
[32:26] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[32:26] Speaker_A | That would be a week anyway . That would be a week anyway , but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title , or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it . So what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title , or is it gonna be on the basis of the title , do they want more time to write the abstract ."
[32:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:44] Speaker_C | Uh f I think if they're really serious
[32:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:55] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[32:57] Speaker_C | Yep .
[33:05] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[33:05] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[33:11] Speaker_B | And we've got they we've got an email address for them to send all this to , haven't we ? Or what was it ?"
[33:22] Speaker_C | Getting access to the uh to the account . Blah blah blah blah .
[33:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:31] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yep .
"[33:42] Speaker_A | we possibly have it , but I'll just sort that out with him . Because if we're gonna tell everyone to email P_G_C_ , then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff . 'Cause uh so far I've just been using my own uh email address . But it would be better it's quite easy to send f from an email address . 'Cause you can send from any email address you like . It's just the fact that you need to p uh it's just the fact that when they reply to it , you need to be able to uh access it . So I already tried it once , and I'm sure they gave us a password . And I even I even actu"
[33:50] Speaker_B | Mm .
[33:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[34:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:28] Speaker_A | You may already know , but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts , you know , when you do the philosophy and and thingy one , then if you want to send from P_G_C_ , then uh I mean you might already know , but you can go f if if you did it from web-mail , you can just create a new account for yourself and where it sa it actually has a send from address , and you can just put P_G_C_ at ling dot and just do it that way . Uh or depending on your normal email client , you might be able to do it , but it doesn't matter too much . The the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as P_G_C_ , depending on what you wanna do ."
[34:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[34:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[35:04] Speaker_A | But that's what I'll do . I'll send it from P_G_C_ , so if anyone replies , it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time . Presumably , you can access from web-mail or , you know , or I_ MAP or whatever ."
[35:19] Speaker_C | Should I take care of the web page ?
"[35:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something , and anything else you might wanna do , and then later on we can put the uh the programme in ."
[35:28] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[35:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[35:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm , cool ."

[36:25] Speaker_A | So I mean maybe m I mean ideally I suppose we'll meet again here . So we can with Melissa and we'll just send out an email . Okay ?
"[36:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , and uh that that would be cool . Okay , so um I mean I won't get in touch with Philosophy . Or I won't send anything to Philosophy and Informatics till I've got your email . 'Cause I'll just tell 'em a modified version of that . But I'll try and get a good address to send it to ."
[36:41] Speaker_A | Yep . That's fine .

[00:14] Speaker_B | Is that alright now ?
[00:19] Speaker_B | Sorry ?
"[00:23] Speaker_B | Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . All ready to go ? Okay . Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s"
[00:27] Speaker_D | Could you plug me in ?
"[01:40] Speaker_B | Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design ."
[01:56] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[02:21] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[02:30] Speaker_B | Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere ."
"[02:37] Speaker_D | And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?"
"[02:43] Speaker_B | Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um"
[02:51] Speaker_D | 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
"[02:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long ."
[02:54] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[02:59] Speaker_B | Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? Right um , time for presentations then . Who would like to go first ?"
"[03:22] Speaker_A | Nope , we're all set ."
[03:30] Speaker_D | Sure .
"[03:30] Speaker_B | Okay , cool ."
"[03:39] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead ."
[04:34] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[04:47] Speaker_D | Right .
"[04:48] Speaker_C | Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um sh show you now ."
"[05:34] Speaker_C | Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . Uh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for buttons . Um , and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button ."
[05:45] Speaker_B | Oop .
"[06:02] Speaker_C | Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it ."
[06:26] Speaker_B | Um . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . Just a couple of minutes anyway .
[06:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[06:33] Speaker_D | M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . But anyway , um we might come to that later ."
[06:50] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .
"[06:53] Speaker_A | Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. ."
[06:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:05] Speaker_D | I see , so it's more just basic . Right , okay ."
[07:06] Speaker_B | Looks kind of Yeah .
[07:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:12] Speaker_D | Yeah . Sure .
[07:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[07:40] Speaker_C | Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ ."
[07:45] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:48] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[07:50] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah ."
[07:57] Speaker_D | Which was that ?
"[08:01] Speaker_D | Up the numbers , or the up down ?"
"[08:02] Speaker_B | God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , I mean would anybody disagree with that ?"
[08:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[08:12] Speaker_B | Um , what else , uh So don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , you know like brightness and contrast ?"
[08:23] Speaker_D | We don't ? No ?
[08:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:27] Speaker_D | Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Is that right ? Is that what we're we're doing ? We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?
[08:33] Speaker_B | Mm .
[08:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:40] Speaker_C | Um , yeah ."
[08:46] Speaker_B | I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?
"[08:49] Speaker_C | Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible ."
[08:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:05] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[09:08] Speaker_C | There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers ."
"[09:19] Speaker_D | Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . Something like that ."
[09:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm yeah .
[09:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[10:16] Speaker_B | Okay . Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Any of you anything to add to that at all ? No ."
[10:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:40] Speaker_A | No . I'll add it later , I guess the presentation ."
"[10:42] Speaker_B | Okay , right . Um okay , if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um"
[10:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[10:49] Speaker_D | Sure .
[10:52] Speaker_D | Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ? No .
[10:54] Speaker_A | No . No .
"[10:55] Speaker_B | Probably not , actually ."
[10:58] Speaker_D | So why don't I just pick up and move then .
[11:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:18] Speaker_D | Mm er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now ."
[11:19] Speaker_C | Just just switch them .
[11:29] Speaker_D | Okay .
[11:31] Speaker_B | Right .
"[11:35] Speaker_D | Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . Yeah , yeah . Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up ? Okay ."
"[11:47] Speaker_B | Oh , like overlap between what you said ? Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen ."
"[12:09] Speaker_B | Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah ."
[12:17] Speaker_B | Okay .
[12:19] Speaker_A | Um function F_ eight .
"[12:20] Speaker_B | Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah ."
[12:22] Speaker_D | Okay .
[12:31] Speaker_D | F_ eight ?
"[12:32] Speaker_A | Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . Yeah . You have to push it together ."
"[12:34] Speaker_D | Oh , and F_ eight . Okay ."
[12:35] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:37] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:38] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[12:44] Speaker_D | Okay , I think that that's doing it now ."
[12:49] Speaker_A | Nope . Try that again .
"[12:52] Speaker_D | Uh , again ?"
[12:53] Speaker_C | Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .
[12:53] Speaker_A | Wait .
[12:55] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[12:58] Speaker_D | Um , okay great ."
[12:58] Speaker_B | Oh oh here we go . There you go .
"[12:59] Speaker_A | Yep , there we go ."
"[13:02] Speaker_D | Okay . Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so ."
[13:23] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[13:26] Speaker_A | That's much better .
[13:27] Speaker_B | Right .
[13:33] Speaker_A | There you go .
"[13:33] Speaker_B | Right , okay ."
"[14:22] Speaker_D | Dunno . Okay . Um . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them ."
[14:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[15:12] Speaker_D | So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um"
[15:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[15:59] Speaker_D | and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .
[16:02] Speaker_B | Repetitive strain injury .
"[16:07] Speaker_D | Uh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um ."
[16:46] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[17:01] Speaker_B | Okay . So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . Okay ."
"[17:06] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through ."
[17:37] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[17:40] Speaker_B | So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . That's I think it's a good idea ."
"[17:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . But not let that confine us technologically ."
[17:56] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:57] Speaker_B | Okay .
[18:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:13] Speaker_B | Okay . Right .
[18:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:38] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:41] Speaker_D | Where's the money , maybe ."
"[18:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . So , who do you think we're aiming this at ?"
[18:44] Speaker_D | Yeah . And who watches T_V_ .
[18:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:52] Speaker_D | Mm .
[18:57] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[19:02] Speaker_A | Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?"
"[19:13] Speaker_A | Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? Right . Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Kind of . You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? Like a simple replacement , right . I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ?"
"[19:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
[19:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[19:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[19:28] Speaker_B | Okay .
[19:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:35] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[19:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . Mostly focused around the twenty five age group ."
[19:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:51] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[19:54] Speaker_B | Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ?"
[19:58] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[19:58] Speaker_D | Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm"
[20:01] Speaker_B | Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ?
"[20:09] Speaker_B | What what do you think , Craig ?"
"[20:11] Speaker_C | Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group ."
[20:19] Speaker_C | Uh f
[20:22] Speaker_B | N yeah .
"[20:24] Speaker_B | I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . So we could say that was our target ."
[20:27] Speaker_D | Okay .
[20:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:29] Speaker_D | Sure .
[20:31] Speaker_D | Sure .
[20:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[20:49] Speaker_A | I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .
[20:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[20:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[20:57] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing ."
[21:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:04] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[21:04] Speaker_A | I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . So these are people who are gadgety , right ? People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular Yeah . Yeah . Mm ."
[21:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:13] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:15] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:20] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:21] Speaker_D | But yeah .
"[21:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure . Mm-hmm ."
[21:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:32] Speaker_B | Yeah . So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . That that's that's a good point . Um okay , so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can ."
[21:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:46] Speaker_D | If we can .
"[21:47] Speaker_A | I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use ."
[21:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:53] Speaker_B | Okay . Why is that ?
[22:04] Speaker_D | Right .
[22:04] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:05] Speaker_D | Could it be an on off thing ? Like if you want it on Yeah .
"[22:07] Speaker_A | Um , but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first ."
[22:08] Speaker_B | Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?
[22:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . Sure .
[22:17] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:22] Speaker_D | Sure . Yeah .
[22:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:29] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[22:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:32] Speaker_B | Okay . Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah . Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Um ."
[22:33] Speaker_D | Sure . Yep .
"[22:37] Speaker_A | Okay , sure ."
[22:38] Speaker_D | Yep .
[23:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[23:16] Speaker_C | I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . Channel up ."
"[23:24] Speaker_D | Right . Oh really , you've seen one before ."
[23:25] Speaker_B | Really ?
[23:26] Speaker_B | Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?
[23:32] Speaker_C | I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .
"[23:34] Speaker_A | Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . Thanks ."
[23:34] Speaker_B | Mm . Course not . There you go .
"[23:37] Speaker_A | Cool , um . Okay . Um . Well this is just the working design um . Well this is just what how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that ."
[23:41] Speaker_B | Right .
[23:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:54] Speaker_D | Right .
[24:15] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[24:36] Speaker_A | Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um"
[24:45] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[24:56] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:04] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[25:13] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:34] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[25:50] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:07] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:18] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:23] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Okay .
[26:25] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:25] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[26:32] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[26:32] Speaker_B | Uh . Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? Are you are you all done ?"
[26:34] Speaker_D | Sure . Sure .
[26:43] Speaker_D | Yep .
[26:44] Speaker_B | Mm .
[26:47] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:49] Speaker_B | Okay . Right .
[26:49] Speaker_D | Right .
"[26:50] Speaker_D | And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin"
[26:55] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[27:03] Speaker_A | Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed . For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . Uh"
[27:06] Speaker_D | Right .
[27:09] Speaker_B | Okay .
[27:10] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[27:11] Speaker_D | Right .
[27:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:23] Speaker_B | Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . Okay .
[27:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[27:27] Speaker_A | Yep . Yep . So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right ."
[27:31] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[27:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[27:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:43] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:45] Speaker_B | Okay .
[27:53] Speaker_B | Okay .
[27:59] Speaker_B | Okay .
[28:03] Speaker_D | Right .
"[28:03] Speaker_B | Okay . Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha"
[28:23] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[28:27] Speaker_A | There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . I it you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . Not so much further down ."
[28:37] Speaker_D | Right .
[28:39] Speaker_D | Right .
[28:47] Speaker_B | Okay .
[28:49] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:52] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[29:01] Speaker_D | Right .
[29:04] Speaker_D | Okay .
[29:04] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[29:05] Speaker_D | And um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?"
"[29:19] Speaker_A | There's there's not much specific specific information , but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . Because infra-red is something which everybody has ."
"[29:28] Speaker_B | Yeah . W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , so that's what we should do for now I think . Something I was wondering about was the power . Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?"
[29:28] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[29:33] Speaker_D | Just to T_V_ , okay ."
[29:36] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[29:47] Speaker_A | There's a there's Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . Um ."
[29:52] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[29:54] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[29:59] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[30:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:02] Speaker_B | Okay .
[30:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:22] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[30:23] Speaker_B | Um , right . So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ?"
[30:41] Speaker_D | Okay .
[30:42] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[30:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's good ."
"[31:03] Speaker_C | Um . I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel ."
"[31:14] Speaker_B | Okay , right ."
[31:14] Speaker_C | Ta .
"[31:14] Speaker_D | And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?"
"[31:20] Speaker_C | Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness ."
[31:27] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[31:28] Speaker_A | Okay , I think"
"[31:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's as optional functions ."
[31:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:36] Speaker_D | 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . I dunno if that'd be a problem ."
"[31:56] Speaker_A | Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . I mean it might help with the visualisation . And it would actually help with the component build as well ."
[31:59] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[32:04] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay .
[32:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[32:08] Speaker_D | Okay .
[32:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[32:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:30] Speaker_D | Right .
[32:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:38] Speaker_D | 'Kay , okay . Like that ."
[32:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[32:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm okay , great ."
"[32:45] Speaker_B | Okay , right . Um , okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . Whoohoo . Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . Um , do you wanna start with David . Anything else to say at all ? No , okay . Andrew ?"
[33:05] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[33:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[33:42] Speaker_A | Mm no , not really ."
"[33:44] Speaker_D | Um yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Shall we do that , then ? Okay , great ."
"[33:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea ."
[34:01] Speaker_A | Mm .
[34:01] Speaker_B | Uh-huh . Yeah .
"[34:04] Speaker_C | Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ?"
"[34:08] Speaker_A | Um things like on off . Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , um so um And channel . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . Not on off video . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . We put it out ."
[34:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:18] Speaker_B | Okay .
[34:20] Speaker_D | And and channel .
[34:21] Speaker_D | Right .
[34:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:31] Speaker_B | Okay .
[34:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[34:44] Speaker_B | Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay ."
[34:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[34:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . You you put that into audio . And then video is anything that you can see . Um ."
[34:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:53] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:57] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:59] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[35:00] Speaker_D | Colour , yeah ."
[35:02] Speaker_A | Yep .
[35:03] Speaker_D | Sure .
[35:04] Speaker_D | Sure .
[35:04] Speaker_A | Yep .
[35:05] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[35:08] Speaker_D | And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah . Sure , okay . Okay ."
[35:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[35:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:20] Speaker_B | Okay .
[35:30] Speaker_B | Okay .
[35:33] Speaker_D | Okay .
[35:45] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[35:47] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[35:53] Speaker_D | Great .

"[17:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly , yeah ."
[17:15] Speaker_D | Wow .
[17:19] Speaker_B | Um our project uh finance uh
"[17:23] Speaker_B | thing . Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when"
[17:38] Speaker_C | Twenty four .
"[17:39] Speaker_B | designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh"
[17:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:48] Speaker_B | want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um
"[17:53] Speaker_D | Per remote control , yeah ? Per project ."
[17:53] Speaker_B | product .
[17:54] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[17:56] Speaker_B | Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . Uh we will try to uh"
"[18:19] Speaker_B | to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,"
"[18:26] Speaker_C | Ah yeah , the sale man , four million ."
[18:27] Speaker_B | maybe some uh Asian countries .
[18:30] Speaker_B | Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .
"[18:47] Speaker_B | Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?"
[18:53] Speaker_D | Of course .
[18:54] Speaker_B | You all have to be paid .
[18:56] Speaker_A | Mm .
[18:57] Speaker_B | Excuse me ?
[18:58] Speaker_C | Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill
[19:01] Speaker_D | Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Four million .
"[19:05] Speaker_B | Yes , indeed ."
"[19:07] Speaker_B | So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think ."
[19:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:22] Speaker_B | So , that about finance ."
"[19:25] Speaker_B | And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly ."

"[20:25] Speaker_B | Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels ."
[20:26] Speaker_A | Mm .
[20:33] Speaker_A | Mm .
[20:35] Speaker_A | Mm .

[21:17] Speaker_C | So .
[21:17] Speaker_B | S s
[21:18] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[21:18] Speaker_B | Are there some other very important things to to do well ,"
"[21:25] Speaker_B | to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned ."
[21:31] Speaker_A | Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah .
"[21:33] Speaker_C | And uh ,"
[21:43] Speaker_B | Yes . Yeah .
[21:52] Speaker_B | Yes .
[21:53] Speaker_A | Mm .
[21:53] Speaker_D | Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ?
[21:56] Speaker_C | Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for
[21:56] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:00] Speaker_C | television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .
[22:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:06] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:08] Speaker_A | But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .

[22:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:41] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:48] Speaker_A | Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use ."
"[22:59] Speaker_B | Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh"
"[23:09] Speaker_B | w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control ."
[23:11] Speaker_A | Mm .
[23:16] Speaker_A | Mm .
[23:30] Speaker_A | Mm .
[23:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .

"[03:55] Speaker_B | That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . But uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers ."
[04:00] Speaker_C | Like this one .
[04:06] Speaker_C | It's important .
"[04:10] Speaker_C | Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them"
[04:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:45] Speaker_A | Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?
"[04:53] Speaker_C | Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um . There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . It's it's quite easy ."
"[05:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?"
"[05:09] Speaker_C | Yes , rubber ?"
[05:10] Speaker_A | And the buttons ?
"[05:14] Speaker_A | Okay , and uh the colouring ?"
[05:16] Speaker_C | Uh yellow with uh
[05:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[05:39] Speaker_D | Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels ."
"[05:46] Speaker_C | Yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . Or not ?"
"[05:50] Speaker_A | M uh yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition ."
"[05:57] Speaker_C | Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that ."
[06:01] Speaker_B | And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
"[06:04] Speaker_A | Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay , that that's not really really important ."
[06:12] Speaker_C | Yes .
[06:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:18] Speaker_A | The basic okay .
[06:19] Speaker_B | Of our prototype .
[06:20] Speaker_A | Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
[06:26] Speaker_D | Yes .
[06:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:48] Speaker_D | Uh well , I used the the uh documents ."
[06:54] Speaker_D | And these uh
[06:57] Speaker_D | were the most important criteria .
"[07:10] Speaker_B | So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe uh"
[07:19] Speaker_D | Uh well appar
[07:20] Speaker_C | I believe it's fancy too .
[07:24] Speaker_A | No .
"[07:24] Speaker_B | Oh , sorry ."
[07:26] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[07:26] Speaker_A | Okay , so this these are the cr uh the criteria ."
"[07:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria ."
[07:33] Speaker_D | So uh that's about it .
[08:09] Speaker_B | Twenty two .
"[08:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important ."
[08:12] Speaker_B | Yikes .
[08:21] Speaker_C | Well it's very expensive .
[08:26] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[08:27] Speaker_B | Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa yeah ."
"[08:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um"
[08:32] Speaker_B | The number of uh yeah .
[09:04] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:08] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:25] Speaker_A | It makes it the thirteen yeah .
"[09:29] Speaker_A | Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . So um yeah , th this design is not um"
[09:34] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[09:40] Speaker_A | within our price model .
[09:42] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[09:45] Speaker_C | But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there ."
[09:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:59] Speaker_C | So it's c way too expensive .
[10:04] Speaker_B | But that's that's only for the buttons . So the button we can use plastic .
[10:13] Speaker_A | And uh maybe not use the special form .
"[10:17] Speaker_B | And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber ."
[10:23] Speaker_C | Yes .
[10:31] Speaker_A | And um yeah .
[10:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:54] Speaker_C | Type of m maybe another market segment .
[11:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:02] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[11:07] Speaker_C | That's maybe that's better . Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked ."
[11:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:16] Speaker_A | I know , I know ."
[11:36] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[11:43] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[11:44] Speaker_A | Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no ."
"[12:07] Speaker_A | Oh , this is the wrong one ."
[12:15] Speaker_A | So uh that means redesign .
[12:22] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[12:32] Speaker_A | uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first .
"[12:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true ."
[12:53] Speaker_A | We l we can learn .
[12:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:16] Speaker_D | Yay .
[13:18] Speaker_D | Is it ?
[13:20] Speaker_D | Is it fancy ?
"[13:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so ."
"[13:22] Speaker_B | Um the yellow rubber , I think so ."
[13:23] Speaker_C | I think so .
[13:30] Speaker_D | So uh one ?
"[13:32] Speaker_A | Yeah . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two ."
[13:32] Speaker_C | But it's not that fancy .
[13:34] Speaker_C | I mean
[13:49] Speaker_A | That's a flavour as well .
[14:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:11] Speaker_B | It's trendy trendy , fun yeah ."
[14:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:20] Speaker_A | It applies . It yeah .
[14:21] Speaker_D | It it's fancy .
"[14:22] Speaker_B | Well , just give it a two ."
[14:22] Speaker_C | Okay .
[14:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:56] Speaker_C | Yes .
[14:57] Speaker_B | So I believe uh we are close uh to two .
"[14:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , I I agree ."
"[15:00] Speaker_C | Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did yes , we did good ."
"[15:04] Speaker_D | Okay , and uh was it"
[15:07] Speaker_D | innovative ?
[15:14] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[15:15] Speaker_C | Well , let's let's this product ."
"[15:16] Speaker_A | No , we are evaluating this this uh design now ."
[15:18] Speaker_B | Okay .
[15:20] Speaker_C | So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .
[15:20] Speaker_A | This prototype .
[15:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:28] Speaker_B | have the solar , I think ."
[15:37] Speaker_A | That would have been a thrill .
[15:40] Speaker_D | So uh also a uh two ?
[15:42] Speaker_C | I think uh it's a two .
[15:43] Speaker_A | Yep .
[15:48] Speaker_D | Is it easy to use ?
[15:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:54] Speaker_A | I'm not sure .
"[15:56] Speaker_B | Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think ."
"[16:03] Speaker_B | Well , hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly ."
[16:08] Speaker_B | They won't use it .
[16:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:28] Speaker_C | So in that in that way it is advanced ,"
[16:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:32] Speaker_C | and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
[16:44] Speaker_B | I think a three . Wouldn't give it more .
[16:52] Speaker_D | Well the p the most important function is easy to use .
[16:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:57] Speaker_D | The the zapping , channel switching , volume ."
[17:01] Speaker_D | But the more advanced functions are probably
[17:05] Speaker_D | a bit harder .
[17:08] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?
[17:13] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,"
[17:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:40] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh Roo , a three ? Ruud ?"
[17:42] Speaker_B | Yep .
[17:47] Speaker_D | Good question .
[17:49] Speaker_D | Uh I'll go uh for the two .
"[17:54] Speaker_C | So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten ."
[17:58] Speaker_A | So I could make it e easy ?
[17:59] Speaker_B | If you make it a four it will be three in general .
[18:01] Speaker_C | So that's w
"[18:03] Speaker_C | No , two and a half ."
[18:05] Speaker_B | If he makes it a four .
[18:08] Speaker_C | Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half .
[18:08] Speaker_B | Not a three .
[18:15] Speaker_B | Darn . Nee .
[18:17] Speaker_D | Hmm ? Huh ?
"[18:18] Speaker_B | A seven , a three No . A four and a three together . Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? And a three ? Nee . I know ."
[18:20] Speaker_D | Yeah . I yeah .
[18:23] Speaker_C | Four ?
[18:25] Speaker_C | Two ?
"[18:27] Speaker_A | No , I haven't said anything yet ."
"[18:30] Speaker_A | Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five ."
[18:35] Speaker_C | Divided by four .
[18:47] Speaker_A | But I'm filling in a three . Does it will so it will be a two point five .
"[18:52] Speaker_A | Yes , it is . I have a veto . Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about okay , um is it easy to f"
"[19:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , definitely ."
[19:07] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[19:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find ."
[19:12] Speaker_C | It it most definitely is it's very easy .
"[19:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , or beeps or yeah ."
[19:18] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[19:19] Speaker_C | Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . So , I th"
[19:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:36] Speaker_A | Well , I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Um Sebastian ?"
[19:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:45] Speaker_C | Yeah , me too ."
[19:46] Speaker_B | Me too .
"[19:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , I agree ."
[20:05] Speaker_B | Was it one of our options ?
"[20:08] Speaker_A | No okay , but but"
"[20:10] Speaker_A | for the options given , it's the most spongy one ."
"[20:12] Speaker_C | Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . Yes , but it's not good enough , so it's a two ."
[20:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:22] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[20:39] Speaker_C | You take one ? What do you give it ?
"[20:43] Speaker_D | Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah ."
[20:50] Speaker_A | Because we need to go on in for the time .
"[20:55] Speaker_D | Well , if I give it a one"
[20:58] Speaker_D | there'll be one hell of a calculation . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .
"[21:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , depends ."
[21:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:38] Speaker_C | So it's quite advanced .
"[21:46] Speaker_B | If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think"
[21:53] Speaker_B | it is it has all the features um a normal remote has .
[21:57] Speaker_A | I think it has .
[21:58] Speaker_D | Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
"[21:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . So you could uh uh uh"
[22:08] Speaker_C | Yes .
[22:22] Speaker_C | Has uh the signals sent to it .
[22:23] Speaker_D | Signal .
[22:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:28] Speaker_A | enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal ."
"[22:37] Speaker_A | So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced ."
[22:42] Speaker_C | Absolutely .
[22:45] Speaker_C | Yes .
[22:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:04] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[23:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one ."
[23:17] Speaker_B | I'll give a two .
"[23:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . So high quality , low acceptance ."
[23:44] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[23:48] Speaker_A | The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But
[23:55] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[23:57] Speaker_A | whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . D do you agree ?"
[24:03] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:09] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:11] Speaker_D | Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .
[24:22] Speaker_B | But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Uh twenty five .
[24:25] Speaker_A | Twenty five Euros .
"[24:27] Speaker_B | And costs were twelve fifty . But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double ,"
[24:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:37] Speaker_B | Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ?
[24:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:41] Speaker_B | So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah .
[24:44] Speaker_C | M about fifty Euros .
"[24:46] Speaker_C | That's quite ex well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality ."
"[24:47] Speaker_B | That's price , but w w"
"[24:55] Speaker_C | Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes ."
"[24:59] Speaker_B | Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders ."
"[25:01] Speaker_A | Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros ."
"[25:11] Speaker_C | Yes . Yes , but you can you c"
"[25:14] Speaker_C | Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . So I think it's worth its price ."
[25:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , but uh with these ratings uh"
[25:34] Speaker_A | That's counting .
"[25:36] Speaker_C | Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that ."
"[25:37] Speaker_D | should be about one point s seven , yeah ."
[25:37] Speaker_B | Four six seven eight .
[25:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[25:42] Speaker_B | Nine divided by six .
[25:43] Speaker_A | Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .
"[25:56] Speaker_A | About the project itself , not about the product ."
[26:06] Speaker_A | What did you think about uh
"[26:10] Speaker_A | the process , the project process ?"
[26:15] Speaker_A | Ruud ?
"[26:32] Speaker_A | Any any other Uh , Roo ?"
"[26:39] Speaker_B | But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah ."
[26:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:45] Speaker_C | Mm .
[26:49] Speaker_A | Better decision .
"[26:49] Speaker_C | Yes . We had we had too little information actually . So And uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was"
[26:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:02] Speaker_A | Less .
[27:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:08] Speaker_A | So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
[27:16] Speaker_C | Yes .
[27:17] Speaker_D | The prices .
[27:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:33] Speaker_C | We're tempered by that , yes ."
"[27:35] Speaker_A | Okay , Roo ?"
[27:37] Speaker_A | Any other thoughts on that ?
"[27:38] Speaker_B | No , no ."
[27:40] Speaker_A | Ruud ?
[27:41] Speaker_D | I agree .
"[27:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[27:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[27:59] Speaker_C | I think we're a good team .
[28:11] Speaker_C | Yes .
[28:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well ."
[28:30] Speaker_C | I think so too .
[28:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:31] Speaker_A | Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?"
[28:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:41] Speaker_C | The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .
[28:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:00] Speaker_D | Draws .
"[29:01] Speaker_B | Yeah , where it draws . It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen ."
"[29:07] Speaker_A | Okay , so it it had to be um"
"[29:11] Speaker_A | better aligned , or what's the word ? Uh yeah ."
[29:14] Speaker_C | Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds .
"[29:15] Speaker_A | It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? Not at all ."
[29:18] Speaker_C | It is ? Okay .
[29:23] Speaker_C | Okay .
[29:23] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[29:28] Speaker_D | No . Not really .
"[29:30] Speaker_A | Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ ."
[29:33] Speaker_C | I I think so too .
[29:38] Speaker_C | Yes .
[29:38] Speaker_B | Yep .
[29:40] Speaker_C | Yes .
[29:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:53] Speaker_A | To digitise them .
[29:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[29:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:00] Speaker_C | But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . It's not quite uh ergonomic ."
[30:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:35] Speaker_B | Economic .
[30:36] Speaker_C | Eco ergonomic .
[30:37] Speaker_A | I know .
"[30:45] Speaker_A | What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?"
"[30:48] Speaker_D | Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , so can't say much about it ."
[31:10] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[31:10] Speaker_D | No , or the other way around ."
[31:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:11] Speaker_A | Or the other way around , that you could show but m"
"[31:12] Speaker_C | Yes , yes ."
"[31:14] Speaker_B | But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . So it's almost yeah ."
[31:15] Speaker_C | That's quite what PowerPoint does .
[31:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:17] Speaker_A | I know .
"[31:23] Speaker_A | I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it ."
[31:26] Speaker_B | Yep .
[31:27] Speaker_A | We weren't able to do that .
[31:30] Speaker_A | At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th
[31:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .
"[31:37] Speaker_C | An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited ."
[31:41] Speaker_B | I it's not possible yeah .
[31:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[31:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:58] Speaker_B | Oh it looks like paint actually .
"[31:59] Speaker_A | Okay , so y it it's not even as advanced as paint ."
[32:02] Speaker_C | Not not uh n not way . It's quite uh limited .
[32:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:07] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[32:14] Speaker_A | Uh no . Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product ."
"[32:21] Speaker_C | Okay . Oh , very good , celebration ."
[32:25] Speaker_A | Celebrate .
[32:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[32:38] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:43] Speaker_C | I see some action over there .
"[32:45] Speaker_A | Private room , Roo ."
[32:47] Speaker_A | That sounds quite scary .
[32:52] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[32:53] Speaker_A | No , let's find uh the way to"
[33:06] Speaker_C | are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .
[33:13] Speaker_A | get an email .
[33:17] Speaker_C | But um how much time did we get for this meeting ?

[00:00] Speaker_C | Uh yeah . So we've moved over and onto the other eye link . So uh 'cause she's running at the moment .
[00:14] Speaker_C | She did admit it . Yes . Uh-huh .
[00:29] Speaker_C | Hmm . No .
[00:32] Speaker_C | But ma
"[00:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now , isn't isn't it . So it's everyone should know about it now ."
"[00:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , there was a mailing list before . They've just revived that , right ?"
"[00:51] Speaker_B | Right , okay ."
[00:54] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[00:57] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:14] Speaker_B | Right .
"[01:17] Speaker_B | Yeah . Why is uh-huh . Yeah , yeah ."
[01:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:23] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[01:27] Speaker_B | Yeah . So how long does this put you back for ? Is it you know . How much disruption does this cause ? D is this a day ? Two days ? Day and a bit ? Yeah . Uh-huh .
[01:32] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[01:38] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
[01:44] Speaker_B | To actually do the re-install . You c
[01:50] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[01:54] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[01:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . And I saw uh a bunch of stuff about software updates . That's un unrelated to this problem , right ? Um the Eye-Link . I c I didn't read 'em . I saw like five messages go back and forth . Maybe they were under the wrong subject header ."
"[02:17] Speaker_B | Oh no , I mean the Eye-Link software ."
[02:27] Speaker_C | And was r was running . 'Cause Frank did all that because he then had an experiment . So he's run an experiment and it's all worked .
[02:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . So uh i uh did he get his data in ? Or is this put his schedule back ?
[02:35] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[02:42] Speaker_B | He's done it , okay ."
[03:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:22] Speaker_C | Yep .
[03:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[03:34] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . So I've got a new um trainee who might need amusement at some point . So if you need to borrow a head that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else , I'll th I'll ask her if she'd mind coming down and helping you out for uh a while . But I guess Ellen was gonna be your the p the person who yeah , your spare head . Right ."
"[03:56] Speaker_B | Yeah . So um uh mine is well , she's actually climbing Ben Nevis today , I think . But uh she'll be uh back tomorrow . Her name's Nynke . Did you guys meet her ?"
[04:09] Speaker_A | Don't think so . Mm .
[04:11] Speaker_C | Nynke . Mm-hmm .
"[04:21] Speaker_C | Mm . Well I did meet uh uh uh uh someone from another project of yours on Wednesday evening it was . Hei Heidi , who is the gesture of autism . Yeah , mm-hmm ."
"[04:29] Speaker_B | Oh , who is that ? Oh yeah , Heidi . Oh yeah , she's good . You guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does , well , you know , stuff for the video coding and gesturing ."
[04:38] Speaker_C | Mm yep .
"[04:42] Speaker_C | And autism , yeah ."
"[04:44] Speaker_B | So , okay ."
"[05:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , so I'll try and try and get Camtasia up and running so I can try it out when when when we've got her coming in . And we'll just sort of do a run-through of proper pilot just to just just so I can see th"
[05:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:19] Speaker_A | Yep . Yep . Um yeah , I'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the f um audio signal as well . Uh so but uh it should be the yeah , the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly . So that should that should make that slightly easier ."
[05:19] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[05:24] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Uh yep .
[05:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[05:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , yep . Uh but yeah , so they're fortunate have speakers o on the monitors inside the room . So as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on Windows is what gets played . So so just change sound to whatever you like , just go through the Windows control panel ."
[06:00] Speaker_B | Right .
"[06:04] Speaker_B | Okay . So we want one you can pick up using Matlab or something , right ? Aye ?"
"[06:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , yep ."
[06:21] Speaker_B | Okay . Perfect .
[06:35] Speaker_B | Perfect . So or you're gonna bank the script some place and tell us how to run it . Uh-huh . 'Cause we won't know . Right . Well that all sounds good .
"[06:55] Speaker_A | Yep , yeah , the the one the one in just installed should have that now . Um we'll double we'll double-check and re-install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines . But yeah , it should uh should be updated without any ."
"[07:06] Speaker_C | Rather than just a blob uh Ellen wanted something to look more like an eye so that you knew that was the eye . There was like yeah , mm-hmm ."
[07:13] Speaker_B | Oh really ? Oh okay .
"[07:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye . And we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse ."
"[07:23] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , okay . Very nice , very pretty . It doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath ?"
[07:31] Speaker_B | Version one . Mm-hmm .
[07:36] Speaker_B | It's not too bad . Uh-huh . I c I can I can see where that's useful . No .
[07:44] Speaker_B | Just change it . Mm-hmm .
[07:46] Speaker_C | Want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though . So you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes .
[07:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:55] Speaker_A | Yep , ."
[08:26] Speaker_B | What else ?
[08:28] Speaker_A | Uh I'll try it .
[08:29] Speaker_B | You were saying Joe with the model builder .
[08:43] Speaker_B | Oh that's good .
"[09:07] Speaker_C | And basically the parallelogram was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the uh model builder in the actual yeah . Just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image . Not rotated . So it wasn't anything to do with rotation . It was f yeah , just the parallelogram . So uh entirely sure . Must be some way of how the vertices were described or uh defined in one way or compared to something else ."
[09:07] Speaker_B | Oh okay .
[09:16] Speaker_B | Really ?
[09:22] Speaker_B | Just the parallelogram .
"[09:43] Speaker_C | Joe , yep ."
"[10:17] Speaker_B | Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah ."
"[10:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you need to draw 'em in something . Oh , so yeah , I suggested you do that in X_ fig . Is that a reasonable thing to do or no ?"
[10:30] Speaker_C | It it i yes .
"[10:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . So so you can you can do it in X_ fig , export them as S_V_G_ , and you just get a you just get a list of X_Y_ coordinates . Um and then I'll just write in a little script that turns those X_Y_ coordinates into a part ."
"[10:35] Speaker_B | Yep , mm-hmm ."
"[10:41] Speaker_B | Yeah . So this is this falls down completely if Nijmegen can't run X_ fig . So you better check that with 'em , right ?"
[10:47] Speaker_A | Well the thing is it's S_V_G_ . So so long as I've got something that will output S_V_G_ .
"[10:51] Speaker_B | Okay , but they may need help finding the something if they can't do X_ fig , I suppose ."
"[11:05] Speaker_A | Um I kn I know Adobe and things have faculties that do it . But obviously they're like a few hundred pounds . Um so , oth but other I I'd b I'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it . Um I ha I have a feeling that the um Amaya , the W_ three C_ browser , does it . Have a feeling that that can actually edit S_V_G_ files ."
[11:15] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[11:20] Speaker_B | Yep , mm-hmm ."
"[11:39] Speaker_A | Yep , yep ."
[11:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:45] Speaker_C | Yeah . And it's not it's not an immediate problem anyway . But I thought it was worth before Joe disappears just checking that the model builder's not restricted to just doing the tamgrams . Or something tha you know . So uh no it does look like it's uh M_S_N_ .
"[11:45] Speaker_A | Yep , fair enough ."
"[11:54] Speaker_B | Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah ."
"[11:58] Speaker_B | Oh , so well I can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in S_V_G_ format that would fox the model builder in some way . I don't know , I mean it 'cause you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed , right ?"
"[12:12] Speaker_C | Um no , but as long as they're solid polygons it should be alright ."
"[12:16] Speaker_B | Um right , it doesn't matter whether they're um convex or concave in funny ways ."
"[12:28] Speaker_B | Yeah , ex"
[12:34] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[12:34] Speaker_B | And you tried it . Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
[12:38] Speaker_C | Or part of it was convex . Yeah .
"[12:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , by by a by a part of it crosses over itself . Um s so it's sorta like a b"
"[12:59] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
"[13:03] Speaker_B | Well but by self-intersection here , I'll draw here , if I can find the right end of the pen . Y do you mean something like that ? Yeah . A and you can rule out something like that , right . 'Cause that's two parts for you ."
[13:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[13:14] Speaker_C | Well uh uh realise what we're I would consider that two parts , yep ."
"[13:26] Speaker_B | Well , I don't know . I mean it you know , later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now . I think this isn't important enough . Yeah ."
[13:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . If if it if it becomes a yeah .
[13:32] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yep .
"[13:34] Speaker_A | Yep . Yeah , so for now we'll just just assume that non-interse non-intersecting um and um yeah , and then there's this at the moment the e the S_V_G_ stuff can output ones which aren't closed polygons . But um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the l end point to the start point . So so uh , yeah , so as long as long as they're yeah , so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough , it should be alright . So um but yeah , suppose let Nijmegen uh find their find their own S_V_G_ , sort of find something that does S_V_G_ and then we'll see if there's any problems ."
[13:51] Speaker_C | The last point to the yeah .
"[13:53] Speaker_B | Yep , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."
[14:02] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[14:05] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[14:10] Speaker_B | Yeah . But but but if they have trouble , you know , half an hour googling and helping helping them is probably worthwhile . 'Cause someti sometimes people I mean it actually I would e I wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something 'cause J_P_ is quite up with all the all these things . So Um are th"
"[14:10] Speaker_C | Yes , yeah ."
"[14:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[14:22] Speaker_C | J_P_ is quite yeah , uh-huh ."
[14:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:14] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[15:17] Speaker_B | Um yeah . I haven't looked through other mail . I did see something from Marloes . Is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or i they reasonably happy at the moment ?
"[15:26] Speaker_C | Nope . Uh I think they've um they're not waiting anything from us . Uh they've dumped the pilot , the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their English participants , or English speaking participants . Yeah . Uh but they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data . Uh they well , they dumped it on the mm B_S_C_ C_W_ server . But I've moved well , I haven't moved it , I've copied it onto the C_S_V_ , yeah ."
"[15:42] Speaker_B | Oh , they've done the pilots ? Oh good ."
[15:46] Speaker_B | Dumped the data . Where is it dumped ?
"[15:58] Speaker_B | Well that's okay . You know , we're not using that much space if it's just for interim . And they have to get out to us some way . Um uh we had a uh brief discussion just before I left about uh this idea of exchanging data by fire-wire drive and I do I don't know if that ever got resolved . But you know , that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this . So I think B_S_C_W_ is the right way to exchange these . We just have to wipe this stuff off and keep separate copies after that ."
[16:02] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[16:24] Speaker_C | And I've uh sent a thing off to Marloes talk trying to encourage her again to register for the C_S_V_ and uh and what to the C_V_S_ and uh wha what to do and uh which bit of software I use that seems to be quite easy and simple . Yep . Nope . Well yes and no , as in yes , it's new , and no , I haven't got a problem . Yep . Oh so far . Yeah . Uh-huh . Uh y yes . Uh and I am just using it through um a Windows bolt-on sort of piece of software ."
[16:33] Speaker_B | The C_V_S_ .
"[16:41] Speaker_B | Oh , so you're managing that okay , and you haven't run into C_V_S_ before . Okay . Well good ."
"[16:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[16:50] Speaker_B | Well that's that's reassuring .
"[17:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , but other than that that was easy enough to install though , wasn't it . It was yeah ."
"[17:05] Speaker_C | Yeah . No I've just yeah , straight-forward and then you just right right yeah , r and right click things in in Windows Explorer . That's it ."
[17:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:36] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[17:40] Speaker_B | Well that's it , we'll never see him here again . Watch , I'll find out he's got a better computer at home as well , right ? ."
"[17:53] Speaker_B | Right , and what about um the project as a whole ? Is there anything that Ruud or anybody is after that we aren't supplying ? Not at the moment , right ?"
"[18:21] Speaker_B | Y uh yeah , and general places . But yeah , I wouldn't worry too much about it unless they ask you for specific input . Yeah ."
"[18:25] Speaker_C | Right . Well I I'm not really bothering . But it there's that's what's circulating around the the group as a whole at the moment . Um I've sorted out uh travel et cetera to Munich for e for Ellen , John and myself . And we're all off on the fourteenth of December . Coming back on the Friday . the sixteenth , yes ."
[18:29] Speaker_B | That's what's circulating .
[18:32] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[18:40] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[18:48] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . And John's going . Mm-hmm . Oh that's good .
"[19:00] Speaker_C | That's a so that's How to hire or how to interview , is that that uh book ."
[19:14] Speaker_B | So is there anything else ? What have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again ?
[19:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:05] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[20:13] Speaker_B | Okay .
[20:16] Speaker_B | Um I'll have to look . I can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago .
"[20:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it's it's just the G_D_F_ specification page on the uh on the Wiki ."
[21:26] Speaker_C | Spend . Mm-hmm .
[21:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[22:04] Speaker_B | No , I can't even remember . So I'll I'll look at it . Uh but uh I'm sure it's fine 'cause um it's just my memory of things ."
"[22:07] Speaker_A | Yep . Fair enough , fair enough ."
[22:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:29] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , uh-huh ."
"[22:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . So um is that gonna have a voice-over or is it we had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this in in Dutch , yeah . And uh and so , you know , you could just have sort of well the I think we discussed having it with an English voice-over or having it with no voice-over and then having it w just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break . So to emphasise the I may be imagining it ."
[23:04] Speaker_A | Mm .
[23:12] Speaker_C | Separated .
"[23:13] Speaker_B | Oh , so we could produce a Dutch voice-over for the same thing . Yeah ."
"[23:15] Speaker_C | Yes , mm-hmm . Yep ."
"[23:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . So yeah . So so we just ended the just ended the the Dutch stream , yeah , the video and our audio . And then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that outp"
[23:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:35] Speaker_B | Okay , the oth the other issue is um uh i if we do a voice-over uh does that affect the language that the people choose to use . S so that might be another reason for not doing that ."
"[23:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[23:43] Speaker_C | Might use . Or are you going to prime them in any way ? Doing uh anything with the voice , you know . If you start talking about have to avoid or uh yeah , talking about the parts or just naming them or anything like that . Mm-hmm ."
[23:50] Speaker_B | Alignment or you know .
[23:56] Speaker_B | Yeah . So I think maybe that was another reason for um just having
[24:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:18] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah . Well that y
[24:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[24:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well one thing uh one one thing that Camtasia can do , you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that . But you could like have videos of people click on the mouses and sorta or whatever else , mm-hmm ."
[24:43] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[24:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[24:55] Speaker_C | Yes , I think it can generate uh things ."
[25:01] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
"[25:05] Speaker_B | Yeah . So you gonna clear or r however you do this with Ellen , right ? 'Cause she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff ."
[25:18] Speaker_B | Oh well remin remind her that there was a question about whether there oughta be one .
[25:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[25:39] Speaker_B | I bet Marloes just talked to 'em .
[25:54] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[26:02] Speaker_C | No , that should be a problem . I'll be straight-forward enough , I think ."
[26:05] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:11] Speaker_B | Oh um uh on my holidays we encountered a children's toyshop where there we there were tamgrams . And my son reminded me that he ca hasn't been able to find his tamgram set in a while . Well uh if not if you guys are using it . Or do y do you find it helpful to have it ?
"[26:33] Speaker_B | Oh , but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits . If you if you're using it , keep it . He's got plenty of toys . If you're not if you're not using it , then I'll take it back ."
[26:35] Speaker_C | Um yeah .
[27:02] Speaker_A | Oops .
"[27:09] Speaker_B | Oh , similar types , uh-huh ."
[27:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:25] Speaker_B | Right . So um how you gonna get your complexity ratings ? Google .
[27:29] Speaker_C | No .
"[27:31] Speaker_B | Is there a big tamgram community that ranks these things ? Like , you know , that's just one booklet that came with one set of tamgrams ."
[27:37] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Uh I'll try I'll try . You never know what's what's out there .
[27:42] Speaker_B | Or or is it obvious like when you look at these things ?
[27:45] Speaker_C | Well uh um I'm hoping the Dutch input will allow us to p sort of have a rough idea of what was the of a suitable complexity for the task .
"[27:56] Speaker_B | Yeah . But that still won't tell you well how many tamgrams are there that they're using ? Fifteen or something . No , not even ."
"[28:03] Speaker_C | Uh no , not even that . They've of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use , probably three . Uh we've to generate sixteen in total ."
"[28:11] Speaker_B | Uh-huh . So that's not gonna g so that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity . That's just gonna tell you where in the span you wanna be . You still need some kinda scale for these things . Ca uh if you look at 'em , do you just know ?"
[28:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[28:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , ideally ."
"[28:48] Speaker_B | Who is Psychology already uses tamgrams that's still around ? Mean , people have been using tamgrams for ages . So there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact ."
[28:59] Speaker_C | I'll try and find out . I don't know off off hand certainly .
[29:01] Speaker_B | Right . I only know ancient papers . So like late eighties .
[29:08] Speaker_B | Do people still use tamgrams ?
[29:12] Speaker_B | Oh . So we're very old-fashioned .
[29:24] Speaker_C | But I'm not sure if anything's happened since then .
"[29:41] Speaker_B | So uh sorry , that was k I think a big diversion , and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this stuff was up and the I was gonna look at the G_D_F_ spec . Are the rest of the y uh are is the rest of what you're to do with that software fairly clear ? 'Cause this is about the analysis . You really only need Robin , right , to to specify the rest ."
"[29:57] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah , so this yeah . Yes , yes . He'll he'll just be working with Robin on what analysis we need to get out of the G_D_F_ format . Um so I'm gonna c basically I've got a the gest analyser's the base the basis for uh um ASCII to G_D_F_ converter . Um so what I'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a G_D_F_ output part to it . Um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video . Um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the X_M_L_ . So so that's that's what I'm gonna look at . And then once I've done that I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the G_D_F_ ."
[30:14] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
"[30:23] Speaker_B | Yep , mm-hmm . Yeah ."
[30:34] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[30:54] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[30:54] Speaker_C | To try and , yes , and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings . So yep ."
"[31:00] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you might wanna try and come . If you get that far , try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see . Um uh y Ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list , right . So so Yeah . So , but it'd be good to , you know , make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it . So um , you know , if we do talk about that , then it might be nice to have her along for it ."
"[31:00] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
[31:14] Speaker_A | Yep .
[31:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[31:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Um oh , I found haven't fount it physically yet , but uh a reference to uh a ninety two paper . It's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model , blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build , you know , replicate the model out with the parts . Uh just one person at a time of course . But uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject . Ballard ."
[31:55] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[32:05] Speaker_B | Oh yeah . Who is that then ?
[32:08] Speaker_B | 'Kay . Um are they still in the business ?
"[32:09] Speaker_C | Back in ninety two . Yes , I think so . Uh the I'll mm not sure ."
[32:13] Speaker_B | Where are they ?
"[32:17] Speaker_B | Okay . Well , they might have the folk wisdom on the complexity , right ? So Ninety two's not that long ago ."
[32:21] Speaker_C | Yep .
[32:25] Speaker_C | Yeah . So there should still be well Not that on . Is it . Y uh-huh . Uh that's what I've m I'll have to try and find out . Uh Hmm . If not um the National Library is bound to have it .
[32:32] Speaker_B | Um is it a paper you can get ?
"[32:37] Speaker_B | Well , they still do it for library loans and stuff , so ."
"[32:44] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , yep ."
[32:56] Speaker_C | She's not here next week anyway . It's next Wednesday or Thursday before she's back .
"[33:04] Speaker_B | Okay . Oh yeah , c she 'cause she her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list 'cause she's not mailing from her normal account ."
[33:19] Speaker_C | Ah .
[33:24] Speaker_C | Or or oh well . That's only if things haven't been getting through . Ah .
[33:39] Speaker_B | Yep . Anything else ?
"[33:41] Speaker_A | Um I think that's it . And I'll t uh yeah , I'll get get working on the Camtasia stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this , I can think about whether G_D_F_'s got everything we need in it . Um and f yeah , what analysis we can pull out of it ."
[34:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[34:11] Speaker_B | Oh well , maybe it is then ."
[34:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:30] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[34:33] Speaker_C | That's what they're getting . Yeah .
[34:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[34:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , 'cause they I mean we w we got all this in the ASCII format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the G_D_F_ so I can actually do the proper analysis . Um 'cause I think all the answers are gonna be run off the G_D_F_ format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else , it has to be G_D_F_ ."
[34:54] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[35:15] Speaker_B | Oh right . Okay . So y actually you're breaking this down into two steps now . One is just a straight extraction from the ASCII , and the other one is any post-analysis that that adds information by analysing it . Is that th"
"[35:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's just anything that's got shoved through the eye-tracker . Yeah ."
"[35:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . Okay , that is post-analysis . Yeah . So right , yeah ."
"[36:00] Speaker_C | That filter Mm yeah , filter out ."
[36:03] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[36:06] Speaker_B | Oh well , that all sounds good ."
[36:12] Speaker_C | Unless y
"[36:31] Speaker_C | Hmm . Watch out Well I think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something . Some b uh JAST report . Officially . Into reality , uh-huh ."
[36:44] Speaker_B | What documentation ?
"[36:47] Speaker_B | Oh , okay ."
[36:58] Speaker_B | But yeah . I mean I do spend time talking to you guys . So you're getting something out of me .
[37:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[37:04] Speaker_A | Yep .

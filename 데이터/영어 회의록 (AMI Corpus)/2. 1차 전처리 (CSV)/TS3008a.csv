"[03:57] Speaker_A | examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes ."
"[04:04] Speaker_A | Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Uh , some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly ."
[04:07] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[04:15] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:15] Speaker_A | So now we all know what our

[04:26] Speaker_C | Yes . Antek .
"[04:29] Speaker_A | Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that ."
[04:31] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:01] Speaker_D | Yes .
[05:01] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[05:05] Speaker_A | Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th"
"[05:45] Speaker_A | No , no . Just on the on the screen over there ."
"[05:49] Speaker_A | Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important ."
[05:56] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:00] Speaker_A | This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here .
"[06:05] Speaker_A | It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this ."
"[06:26] Speaker_A | Oh . If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no ."
[06:30] Speaker_B | With that pen ?
[06:33] Speaker_A | But it is pen .

[06:52] Speaker_A | Huh .
[06:53] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:54] Speaker_A | It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser .
[06:55] Speaker_B | Little bit slower .
"[07:00] Speaker_A | And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format ."
[07:15] Speaker_A | And then select current colour or line width .
"[07:19] Speaker_A | So , it's quite easy ."
"[07:22] Speaker_A | Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools ."
"[07:29] Speaker_A | Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright ."
"[07:51] Speaker_A | Oh , let me think ."
[07:55] Speaker_A | Different colours .
[07:59] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[08:07] Speaker_A | Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish ."

[10:29] Speaker_A | Yep .
[10:30] Speaker_B | Okay .

[10:42] Speaker_D | Format .
"[10:54] Speaker_B | Ah , purple ."
[11:10] Speaker_B | That's my bird . Yeah ? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light .

"[11:26] Speaker_B | A small one . Uh , line width ."
[11:32] Speaker_B | Two ? Three . Oh that's okay .
"[11:40] Speaker_B | That's another one . Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know ."
"[12:01] Speaker_A | Oh , okay . Okay ."
[12:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:05] Speaker_A | No , uh it's clear ."
"[12:06] Speaker_B | So more uh birds ? Okay , okay , okay ."
[12:08] Speaker_A | N no no .
[12:10] Speaker_A | We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?
[12:22] Speaker_D | Oh . What should I draw ?
[12:26] Speaker_B | A cow .
[12:26] Speaker_A | Oh .
[12:40] Speaker_D | I'll draw a penguin . Whatever .
"[12:43] Speaker_D | I can't draw , so"
[12:46] Speaker_D | you can start to laugh already .
[12:50] Speaker_D | Whatever . Something like that .
[13:02] Speaker_D | Come on .
"[13:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's little bit hard ."
"[13:07] Speaker_D | Mm hmm hmm , orange ."
"[13:09] Speaker_B | Orange , of course ."
[13:13] Speaker_D | Whatever .

[13:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:50] Speaker_C | I'm going to draw a cat .
"[13:53] Speaker_C | I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal ."
[14:00] Speaker_C | And you can have them at home .
[14:11] Speaker_A | Huh .
[14:13] Speaker_D | Or a line .
"[14:18] Speaker_B | Don't mess with my birds , yeah ."
[14:29] Speaker_D | Hmm . It's a handicapped cat .
[14:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[15:01] Speaker_A | Oh , okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess ."
[15:05] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[15:15] Speaker_A | Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . Yeah ?"
[15:41] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[15:43] Speaker_A | Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ?"
[15:59] Speaker_C | Yes .
[16:08] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[16:08] Speaker_D | I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with"
"[16:13] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[16:18] Speaker_B | Different .
[16:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:45] Speaker_D | Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . I think we should group them . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t"
[16:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[17:00] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[17:11] Speaker_D | Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders ."
[17:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:19] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:22] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[17:28] Speaker_A | But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . It's what , from my experience ."
[17:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:36] Speaker_D | I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .
[17:38] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[17:47] Speaker_A | Oh , it is only for televis"
"[17:56] Speaker_D | well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it ."
"[18:00] Speaker_A | But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ?"
"[18:04] Speaker_B | Uh , in the email . I thought it said uh Yeah , television remote control ."
"[18:05] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
"[18:13] Speaker_C | Yes , that's uh something extras ."
[18:14] Speaker_B | True . Yeah .
[18:17] Speaker_B | True .
[18:18] Speaker_D | Yep .
[18:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it ."
"[18:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[18:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:28] Speaker_D | I guess .
[18:28] Speaker_B | True .
[18:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:30] Speaker_A | Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then ."
[18:43] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[18:45] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ?"
"[18:52] Speaker_A | Maybe a can opener underneath it ? I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably ."
"[19:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , way too high ."
"[19:03] Speaker_B | Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard ."
[19:06] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[19:08] Speaker_A | Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh ,"
"[19:12] Speaker_D | Well that's an idea of course , yeah ."
[19:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[19:21] Speaker_A | original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that ."
[19:25] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[19:38] Speaker_A | 'Kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it ."
[19:55] Speaker_B | Use friendly .
[19:58] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[20:00] Speaker_A | Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something ."
[20:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:11] Speaker_D | Yes , what the market wishes ."
[20:12] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[20:26] Speaker_A | Already s said that . The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . I don't know how much time we have left . Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve ."
"[20:32] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d"
[20:51] Speaker_D | You just got a message .
"[20:52] Speaker_A | Oh , and what does it said ?"
"[20:53] Speaker_D | And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half ."
[20:58] Speaker_B | I didn't get a message .
[21:00] Speaker_D | No .
[21:02] Speaker_D | He's the whatever .
"[21:02] Speaker_B | Oh , the Project Manager ."
"[21:05] Speaker_A | No , we're uh ahead of schedule then ."
"[21:09] Speaker_A | Yeah , close it ."
[21:11] Speaker_B | Okay .

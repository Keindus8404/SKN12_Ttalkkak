[09:17] Speaker_A | That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
"[09:53] Speaker_C | Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think ."
[09:53] Speaker_A | F first .
[10:08] Speaker_B | No .
"[10:18] Speaker_A | Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?"
"[10:22] Speaker_C | Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for ."
[10:23] Speaker_A | Positive .
[10:30] Speaker_A | Okay . What are your experiences ?
[10:34] Speaker_B | Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
[10:41] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[10:44] Speaker_B | And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working ."
[11:09] Speaker_A | So and do they always have that ?
[11:12] Speaker_B | No no no . But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah .
[11:16] Speaker_A | It's easy to you . Okay .
[11:20] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[11:22] Speaker_D | Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all ."
[11:34] Speaker_C | Help also . Thank you .
"[11:37] Speaker_D | And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v not easy to use . So we n barely used it ."
[11:55] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[12:13] Speaker_C | The weight . Not not too heavy .
[12:15] Speaker_A | Not too heavy .
[12:22] Speaker_A | Yes .
[12:22] Speaker_C | Not much buttons .
[12:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:35] Speaker_C | Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic ."
[12:44] Speaker_C | Uh buttons not too small .
"[12:54] Speaker_C | Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control ."
[13:00] Speaker_A | Yes .
[13:08] Speaker_A | Like a phone .
[13:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:24] Speaker_A | So , that's ."
[13:25] Speaker_C | Next .
[13:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:04] Speaker_D | Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it ."
[14:11] Speaker_A | Yes .
[14:12] Speaker_D | And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
[14:24] Speaker_A | Okay . This is It has to be compatible with other things . Okay .
[14:29] Speaker_D | Yes .
[14:35] Speaker_C | I have one more idea . Just popped up .
[14:39] Speaker_A | Yes ?
[14:40] Speaker_C | Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
[14:48] Speaker_A | No battery use .

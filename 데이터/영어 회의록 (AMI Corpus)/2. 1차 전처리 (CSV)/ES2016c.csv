[00:31] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:56] Speaker_A | Right .
[01:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
[01:11] Speaker_A | Alright . Is everyone here ? Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting .
[01:15] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[02:18] Speaker_A | our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um"
[02:38] Speaker_A | that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .
[03:07] Speaker_A | And that it should look different than what's out there .
"[03:15] Speaker_A | Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that"
"[04:10] Speaker_A | Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different ."
"[05:39] Speaker_A | And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also ."
[05:55] Speaker_A | Marketing ? We're watching trends . I suppose that you can have this .
[05:56] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:58] Speaker_D | Yep . Can I have your cable please ? Thanks .
[06:28] Speaker_D | Okay so I was looking at trend-watching .
"[06:34] Speaker_D | Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that ."
"[06:50] Speaker_D | Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before ."
"[07:07] Speaker_D | Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use ."
"[07:25] Speaker_D | As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try ."
"[07:40] Speaker_D | Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel ."
"[08:16] Speaker_D | Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further ."
"[08:49] Speaker_D | Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups ."
[09:27] Speaker_D | And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls .
[09:44] Speaker_D | So that's that .
"[09:46] Speaker_A | So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?"
[09:47] Speaker_B | Alright .
[09:53] Speaker_D | That's what I was thinking yeah .
"[09:54] Speaker_C | Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones ."
"[09:56] Speaker_A | You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy"
[10:06] Speaker_D | various coverings .
"[10:07] Speaker_C | What's it called ? Cust you personalised , yeah ."
[10:07] Speaker_A | Mm various covers .
[10:11] Speaker_D | Personalise your remote .
[10:49] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[10:52] Speaker_C | Why can't I see the crazy . Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had ."
"[11:15] Speaker_C | Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices ."
"[11:29] Speaker_C | They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and"
"[11:55] Speaker_C | well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated ."
"[12:14] Speaker_C | So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a there is a picture . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio ."
"[12:40] Speaker_C | And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out ."
"[13:13] Speaker_C | possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch ."
"[13:34] Speaker_C | And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes ."
"[13:49] Speaker_C | Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design ."
"[14:11] Speaker_C | Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit ."
[14:56] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
[14:59] Speaker_C | Just .
[15:06] Speaker_C | Just to sort of show you .
[15:11] Speaker_C | M they've even got things like that . Huge things . Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?
"[15:19] Speaker_B | That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that ."
[15:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[15:24] Speaker_C | And that yeah .
"[15:24] Speaker_B | Makes sense , makes sense ."
[15:27] Speaker_C | Yeah . See .
[15:39] Speaker_C | Why's my screen crazy ?
[15:44] Speaker_B | Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a
[15:51] Speaker_B | couple of descriptions of the interior .
"[15:56] Speaker_B | Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do ."
[16:14] Speaker_B | Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you
[16:23] Speaker_B | what we're talking about here . Okay .
"[16:28] Speaker_B | The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which"
[17:33] Speaker_B | So much for the the workings of the
[17:37] Speaker_B | of the uh
"[17:39] Speaker_B | remote control itself . Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television ."
[17:52] Speaker_B | When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear .
"[18:04] Speaker_B | Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately ."
"[18:16] Speaker_B | This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over ."
"[18:32] Speaker_B | Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board ."
[18:51] Speaker_B | These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that
[19:05] Speaker_B | amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .
"[19:10] Speaker_B | Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version ."
"[19:45] Speaker_B | And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um I've gotten some information that"
"[20:05] Speaker_B | we could use for the case material plastic ,"
"[20:10] Speaker_B | rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose . Um we could also use wood , or titanium ."
"[20:31] Speaker_B | Oh fya I don't have an information on that . However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay ."
"[20:48] Speaker_B | But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these ."
"[21:03] Speaker_B | Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ?"
[21:21] Speaker_B | Uh a dynamo .
[21:24] Speaker_B | Interestingly enough .
[21:27] Speaker_B | Um we could use solar cells .
[21:31] Speaker_B | Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them
[21:42] Speaker_B | m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously
"[21:53] Speaker_B | I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . May fail though , every here and there ."
[21:55] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[22:09] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah . Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm ."
[22:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:18] Speaker_B | But exactly . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery ."
[22:19] Speaker_D | Y probably not yeah .
[22:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:38] Speaker_B | Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then .
[22:50] Speaker_B | our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert .
[23:05] Speaker_B | However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod
"[23:46] Speaker_B | There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference ."
"[24:11] Speaker_B | I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say"
"[24:27] Speaker_B | rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Or is anybody still alright ."
[24:49] Speaker_D | Mm .
[24:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:52] Speaker_D | No . Hmm .
[24:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:05] Speaker_B | With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and
[25:34] Speaker_C | Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . But then where do people hold it ? Just all be sort of spongy .
[25:42] Speaker_D | Mm . Like a covering . Yeah .
[25:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[26:00] Speaker_D | The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it ."
"[26:10] Speaker_C | So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ?"
"[26:17] Speaker_B | You can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used . Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex"
[26:22] Speaker_C | Right .
[26:37] Speaker_B | is tricky . Or rubber and um
"[26:43] Speaker_B | and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um"
"[26:56] Speaker_B | then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even . Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic ."
[27:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:09] Speaker_B | Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really ."
[27:20] Speaker_A | So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ?
[27:29] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[27:31] Speaker_A | Mm .
[27:33] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[27:48] Speaker_C | Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's thing if we did it yellow . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing ."
[28:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:17] Speaker_A | Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?"
[28:21] Speaker_B | S Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah .
[28:28] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:56] Speaker_B | How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ?
"[29:03] Speaker_B | Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of"
[29:06] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[29:12] Speaker_B | an orange , banana , whatever . You name it ."
[29:15] Speaker_C | Mm .
[29:17] Speaker_B | Just design-wise .
[29:20] Speaker_B | Mm . Nice one .
[29:22] Speaker_C | You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows . I don't suppose we have to stick to co
[29:27] Speaker_B | Mm .
[29:30] Speaker_C | Stick to the colours yeah .
[29:31] Speaker_D | Oh yeah . Yellow and grey .
[29:33] Speaker_A | Yellow and grey .
[29:39] Speaker_A | Grapefruit .
"[29:39] Speaker_B | Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps ."
[29:48] Speaker_B | But mm .
"[29:52] Speaker_A | I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance ."
[29:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:14] Speaker_A | Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .
[30:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:23] Speaker_B | Right .
[30:25] Speaker_A | It's it's yellow . It's curved .
[30:26] Speaker_B | I it's yellow .
[30:27] Speaker_D | Grey buttons yeah .
[30:29] Speaker_A | It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . It would look like a banana just sitting on their table .
[30:37] Speaker_C | On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .
[30:40] Speaker_D | Mm .
[30:41] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:42] Speaker_B | There you go .
"[30:44] Speaker_C | It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was ."
[30:49] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[30:51] Speaker_A | Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . Hey we could have a variety of options here ."
[30:52] Speaker_D | Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl .
[30:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:07] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[31:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:10] Speaker_A | Do you have more to your presentation ?
[31:16] Speaker_A | Oh .
[31:22] Speaker_A | Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could .
[31:24] Speaker_B | Sure . Hang on . There you go .
[31:32] Speaker_A | Like I said we have to make a decision on
[31:36] Speaker_A | a couple of these items here . Um ow . Ow .
[31:53] Speaker_D | So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ?
[32:05] Speaker_D | Oh right okay .
"[32:07] Speaker_B | Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . We can still do that ."
[32:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[32:20] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[32:23] Speaker_B | However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button"
[32:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[32:46] Speaker_D | Mm .
[32:51] Speaker_B | design which we saw there .
"[32:55] Speaker_B | But could be done , of course ."
"[32:57] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case ."
[33:15] Speaker_A | Probably case um material . And probably a shape also .
"[33:21] Speaker_A | Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have ."
[33:41] Speaker_B | Right .
[33:42] Speaker_A | And we have five minutes .
"[33:44] Speaker_B | Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be"
[33:56] Speaker_D | Mm .
[33:58] Speaker_B | a cheap one . Right ?
[33:59] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[34:06] Speaker_A | Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um"
"[34:16] Speaker_A | then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?"
[34:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:29] Speaker_D | Well what about what you said , like putting the"
[34:31] Speaker_C | Just just maybe yeah . Just a little bit of .
[34:33] Speaker_D | finger grips just on top of the plastic ?
"[34:36] Speaker_A | Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ?"
[34:46] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[34:59] Speaker_A | Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .
[35:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[35:25] Speaker_D | So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?"
[35:29] Speaker_D | Yeah ? Okay .
[35:41] Speaker_B | Yes . It does .
"[36:50] Speaker_A | I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?"
[36:57] Speaker_B | Right .
[37:18] Speaker_A | Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .
[37:22] Speaker_B | Right .
[37:26] Speaker_A | Corrine we'll want a product evaluation .
[37:31] Speaker_A | And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
[37:39] Speaker_A | maybe and and get us a prototype .
"[37:44] Speaker_A | Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions ."

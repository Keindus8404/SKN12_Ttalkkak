"[01:25] Speaker_A | Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to"
"[02:02] Speaker_A | Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for ."
"[02:42] Speaker_A | 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes ."
[02:49] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[02:52] Speaker_A | Oh , well let's go ahead and , back , previous . So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ?"
[03:10] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[03:10] Speaker_C | I don't mind going first .
[03:11] Speaker_A | Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?
"[03:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project ."
[03:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:18] Speaker_C | You know you could you could do it yourself actually .
[03:21] Speaker_A | Oh .
[03:21] Speaker_B | Did you send it ?
[03:23] Speaker_A | Save it in the project documents . Okay .
"[03:23] Speaker_C | Put it in Project Documents , yeah ."
[03:31] Speaker_A | Mm-mm-mm .
[03:36] Speaker_A | This one ? Okay .
[03:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:44] Speaker_B | Okay . Great .
[03:44] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[03:48] Speaker_C | Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera ."
"[04:09] Speaker_C | Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off ,"
"[04:23] Speaker_C | the channel going up and down ,"
"[04:26] Speaker_C | volume going up and down , and then mute ,"
"[04:30] Speaker_C | a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus ."
"[04:54] Speaker_C | And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example ."
[04:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[05:03] Speaker_C | These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating ."
[05:39] Speaker_A | Right .
"[05:39] Speaker_C | And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version ."
[05:47] Speaker_C | Okay .
[05:48] Speaker_A | Ready .
"[05:49] Speaker_C | And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place ."
[06:18] Speaker_C | So that's it .
[06:20] Speaker_A | Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ?
[06:26] Speaker_C | Mm . Left .
"[06:32] Speaker_A | Now , that we've discussed Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay ."
[06:32] Speaker_D | I can go .
"[06:35] Speaker_D | Yeah , you should run it ."
[06:40] Speaker_A | Functional requirements . 'Kay .
[06:50] Speaker_A | Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .
[07:37] Speaker_C | And that meaning what ?
[07:40] Speaker_D | They like I guess use the buttons a lot . Yeah .
[07:43] Speaker_C | Okay .
[07:45] Speaker_D | I don't know . It's from my uh research .
[07:48] Speaker_C | Right .
"[07:49] Speaker_A | Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons ."
[07:49] Speaker_D | My team wasn't very clear . That's okay .
[07:50] Speaker_C | Only use ten percent of the buttons .
"[07:58] Speaker_D | I I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really ."
[08:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:05] Speaker_A | Oh , right ."
[08:09] Speaker_A | The buttons .
[08:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:13] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
[08:17] Speaker_D | Good point . It's a necessary evil .
[08:18] Speaker_A | It works . Ready for the next slide ?
"[08:21] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is ."
[08:30] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[08:31] Speaker_C | Lost .
"[08:54] Speaker_D | Yes , it is important for the remote control world ."
[08:59] Speaker_C | ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?
"[09:02] Speaker_A | Could be , yeah ."
[09:02] Speaker_D | Uh possibly .
[09:04] Speaker_B | Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?
"[09:08] Speaker_D | Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I"
[09:08] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[09:11] Speaker_C | Channel , volume , power ."
[09:11] Speaker_D | don't know .
[09:11] Speaker_A | I think that's a pretty good guess though .
"[09:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , I would assume so . I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones ."
[09:34] Speaker_A | Okay . Next slide ?
[09:36] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[09:37] Speaker_D | And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it ."
[09:53] Speaker_A | User-friendly .
"[10:08] Speaker_D | And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it ."
"[10:48] Speaker_A | And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?"
"[10:54] Speaker_D | I guess so , yeah ."
[10:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:00] Speaker_D | Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme ."
[11:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:15] Speaker_C | It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .
"[11:17] Speaker_A | Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . We could definitely include that if we wanted to ."
[11:18] Speaker_C | You know like go to the base . Yeah .
"[11:22] Speaker_A | If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?"
"[11:28] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'm just trying to move it ."
[11:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:38] Speaker_B | 'Kay . I think it should be there , working design ."
[11:40] Speaker_C | Working design .
[11:42] Speaker_A | There we go .
[11:44] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[11:45] Speaker_B | 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart ."
[11:48] Speaker_A | Oh my bad .
[11:53] Speaker_D | Oh that's fine .
[11:54] Speaker_C | Help me .
[12:19] Speaker_D | What exactly is a smart chip ?
[12:21] Speaker_B | Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .
"[12:29] Speaker_C | Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?"
"[12:34] Speaker_B | I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap ."
[12:41] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[12:43] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:45] Speaker_A | Ready ?
"[12:45] Speaker_B | Um yep , nothing here ."
[12:48] Speaker_A | That's okay .
"[12:50] Speaker_B | Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . Um a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system ."
[13:16] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[13:27] Speaker_B | Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again ,"
"[13:35] Speaker_B | something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . Uh this is my fifty second design ."
"[13:47] Speaker_B | Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to ."
"[14:15] Speaker_D | So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?"
[14:18] Speaker_B | This is just like a rough schematic . So this is the internal workings .
"[14:20] Speaker_A | So this would be the front ? So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? Okay ."
[14:22] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
[14:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[14:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance ."
[14:32] Speaker_A | The l the light up kind of Yeah .
[14:32] Speaker_D | Like that we know the battery's working .
"[14:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? We can skip that whole thing . Yep ."
[14:41] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[14:43] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[14:43] Speaker_A | It'd probably be lighting up the key too , right ?"
[14:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:46] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[14:48] Speaker_A | The buttons .
[14:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ?"
"[14:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's it ."
"[14:56] Speaker_A | 'Kay , any p 'Kay ?"
[14:57] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay .
"[14:59] Speaker_A | Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?"
"[15:04] Speaker_B | I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons ."
[15:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[15:10] Speaker_C | Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?"
"[15:19] Speaker_D | I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles ."
[15:29] Speaker_A | Mm .
[15:31] Speaker_C | Ovals .
"[15:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
"[15:38] Speaker_A | We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . Wait , come back ."
"[15:57] Speaker_A | Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . It's not gonna be multi-functional ."
"[16:17] Speaker_A | Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote ."
[16:27] Speaker_A | We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay . And you know what teletext is ?
[16:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:37] Speaker_C | I know .
[16:37] Speaker_D | What is it ?
[16:50] Speaker_D | Like running along the bottom ?
[16:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:52] Speaker_C | It'll give you the sports .
"[16:55] Speaker_D | Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?"
[16:58] Speaker_A | Kind of .
[16:58] Speaker_C | Except the entire screen .
[17:00] Speaker_B | It's the entire screen is just running information at random . Seemingly .
[17:00] Speaker_A | Yeah it's the whole screen .
[17:08] Speaker_D | So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?
"[17:08] Speaker_A | Right . Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm ."
[17:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:21] Speaker_B | Okay . So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?"
[17:21] Speaker_D | Okay .
[17:25] Speaker_A | Yes . It's part of the logo .
[17:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[17:33] Speaker_A | What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright ."
[17:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:17] Speaker_C | It's gonna make it nicer .
[18:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:26] Speaker_B | Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons ."
[18:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:43] Speaker_A | Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ?"
[18:54] Speaker_A | Or kids ?
"[18:54] Speaker_D | No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network ."
[18:57] Speaker_B | Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .
"[19:01] Speaker_A | Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about"
"[19:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think we need it all ."
"[19:11] Speaker_A | technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?"
[19:19] Speaker_D | Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person .
[19:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:23] Speaker_C | We should go for the lowest denominator .
[19:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:25] Speaker_A | Right , okay ."
[19:27] Speaker_C | High school educated .
"[19:49] Speaker_A | Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes ."
"[20:13] Speaker_C | Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute ."
"[20:15] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm , volume ."
[20:17] Speaker_D | And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones .
"[20:20] Speaker_A | Right . And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . 'Kay ."
[20:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:33] Speaker_A | Hey , what else ?"
[20:33] Speaker_C | Um .
[20:42] Speaker_A | Um .
[20:44] Speaker_B | Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?
"[20:52] Speaker_D | Sure , yeah ."
[20:55] Speaker_D | I need we we need a like homing device .
"[20:56] Speaker_B | like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?"
[20:57] Speaker_C | Oh right yeah okay .
[21:01] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
[21:02] Speaker_C | Tracking .
[21:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:06] Speaker_D | Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .
"[21:12] Speaker_B | What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you ."
[21:12] Speaker_A | Right .
[21:18] Speaker_C | But you got a base .
[21:23] Speaker_D | Do you think people'll really go for that though ?
[21:26] Speaker_B | It's useful for the remote phone .
"[21:29] Speaker_A | Hmm . Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?"
[21:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:33] Speaker_D | I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base ."
[21:35] Speaker_A | Right .
"[21:35] Speaker_C | Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery ."
[21:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:42] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[21:43] Speaker_B | Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .
[21:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:57] Speaker_A | Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that ."
[22:09] Speaker_D | Right .
[22:11] Speaker_D | Do w
"[22:11] Speaker_C | Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic ."
[22:19] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[22:21] Speaker_D | Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge"
[22:30] Speaker_A | You could um we could hook it up . Oh .
"[22:32] Speaker_D | It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So basically older people don't really care ."
[22:45] Speaker_D | It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and
[22:50] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[22:54] Speaker_D | just sitcoms and stuff .
[22:59] Speaker_D | Right .
"[23:00] Speaker_C | Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it ."
[23:11] Speaker_A | Right .
"[23:17] Speaker_A | Yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something ."
[23:23] Speaker_D | Right .
[23:26] Speaker_A | A certain phrase
[23:28] Speaker_A | then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .
[23:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:42] Speaker_C | Still fifteen minutes .
[23:48] Speaker_C | Um .
"[23:48] Speaker_A | Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ?"
"[23:50] Speaker_C | Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ?"
[23:58] Speaker_A | Um .
"[23:59] Speaker_D | Wait , on the remote itself ?"
"[24:00] Speaker_C | Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero ."
"[24:03] Speaker_A | How how , yeah , how would you leave those out ?"
"[24:03] Speaker_D | Well , we definitely need those ."
[24:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:06] Speaker_C | Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can like well I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?"
[24:09] Speaker_A | Unless you could say the channel .
[24:11] Speaker_B | I think people would find that too foreign .
"[24:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true . And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ ."
[24:29] Speaker_B | It's when we get satellite .
"[24:31] Speaker_A | Mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . 'Kay . Um ."
[24:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:40] Speaker_A | I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um ."
[24:57] Speaker_A | 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour
[25:02] Speaker_A | of our company and the logo .
[25:04] Speaker_D | Wait .
[25:04] Speaker_C | The colour being yellow ?
[25:06] Speaker_A | I'm guessing . And the R_R_ .
[25:08] Speaker_D | I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .
[25:09] Speaker_B | R_ the double R_ .
"[25:11] Speaker_A | We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys ."
[25:14] Speaker_B | Or is the l
"[25:15] Speaker_D | Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights ."
"[25:18] Speaker_B | Yeah , yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge ."
[25:22] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:22] Speaker_C | Well if you have like a Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ ."
[25:32] Speaker_A | Right .
"[25:37] Speaker_A | So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,"
"[25:41] Speaker_C | Right , yeah ."
[25:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .

[26:24] Speaker_A | The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?
"[26:31] Speaker_C | Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use ."
[26:41] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[26:43] Speaker_D | Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful ."
"[27:00] Speaker_A | Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , you know ?"
"[27:03] Speaker_C | I don't well , I don't know ."
[27:10] Speaker_C | Right .
"[27:10] Speaker_D | So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons ."

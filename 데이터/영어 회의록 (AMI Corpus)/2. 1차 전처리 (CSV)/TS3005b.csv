"[00:13] Speaker_A | Good morning , again ."
[00:48] Speaker_C | One question .
[01:18] Speaker_C | Mm . Yeah .
[01:18] Speaker_A | All set ? Good . Okay .
[01:19] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:26] Speaker_A | Let's see what we can find here .
"[01:35] Speaker_A | Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone . Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation ."
[02:10] Speaker_B | Yes .
[02:31] Speaker_C | I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .
[02:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:33] Speaker_B | Well .
"[02:33] Speaker_A | You can go first , okay ."
"[02:35] Speaker_D | Well , shall I go first with the users ?"
"[02:41] Speaker_D | Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies"
[02:42] Speaker_C | So . Huh ?
"[02:47] Speaker_A | And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a"
[02:50] Speaker_D | E_I_E_ .
"[02:51] Speaker_A | I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you ."
"[02:56] Speaker_C | Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um"
[03:28] Speaker_C | on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh
"[03:36] Speaker_C | gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ? Okay . And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red ."
[04:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:24] Speaker_C | That's basically uh how it works .
"[04:27] Speaker_C | Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh"
[05:14] Speaker_C | Uh I made a little uh
[05:18] Speaker_C | animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works .
[05:21] Speaker_B | Oh right .
[05:27] Speaker_B | There is something turning .
[05:29] Speaker_C | There .
[06:02] Speaker_D | Infrared light .
"[06:03] Speaker_C | Yes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set ."
"[06:23] Speaker_C | Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh"
[07:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:25] Speaker_A | Okay , thank you ."
[07:25] Speaker_C | two of these this meeting . So .
[07:26] Speaker_B | Shall I go uh next ?
[07:27] Speaker_A | Yep .
[07:28] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[07:29] Speaker_A | Please .
[07:31] Speaker_B | So .
[07:36] Speaker_D | Smoking .
"[07:40] Speaker_B | Well uh , my name's , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found ."
"[07:56] Speaker_B | Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there ."
"[08:44] Speaker_B | Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that ."
"[09:04] Speaker_B | Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much ."
[09:52] Speaker_B | And that is my presentation .
"[09:55] Speaker_A | Okay , thank you ."
[09:57] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[10:00] Speaker_D | Check .
[10:11] Speaker_B | You must still have it open .
"[10:36] Speaker_D | Yeah , and the users , actually . The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more ."
[10:48] Speaker_D | Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user
"[11:00] Speaker_D | section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area ."
[11:39] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[11:40] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[11:41] Speaker_D | Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use ."
[11:58] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:10] Speaker_D | Next .
"[12:12] Speaker_D | Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w"
"[12:23] Speaker_D | seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would"
[12:34] Speaker_D | use a lot of but batteries .
"[12:38] Speaker_D | The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger"
[12:48] Speaker_D | etcetera . It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh
[12:54] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:57] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[13:08] Speaker_D | on the remote .
"[13:12] Speaker_D | Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized ."
"[13:18] Speaker_D | or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy ,"
"[13:34] Speaker_D | but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use ."
[13:52] Speaker_C | Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ?
"[13:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , touch screen , yeah ."
[13:55] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[13:57] Speaker_D | The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons ."
[14:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
[14:12] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[14:35] Speaker_D | And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels ."
[14:44] Speaker_D | And that is it .
"[14:46] Speaker_A | Okay , thank you ."
[14:46] Speaker_B | Oh right .
"[14:50] Speaker_A | Um , well thank you all , huh . I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? Well ,"
[14:57] Speaker_B | No .
[14:58] Speaker_B | Res I did not . Perhaps the rest ?
[14:59] Speaker_C | No .
[15:01] Speaker_A | then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can
"[15:06] Speaker_A | all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm ."
"[15:11] Speaker_A | Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions ."
[15:19] Speaker_B | Oh .
[16:10] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[16:10] Speaker_A | So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?"
[16:14] Speaker_B | Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ?
[16:16] Speaker_D | Be television .
[16:21] Speaker_A | Yeah . Only be used for television .
[16:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:24] Speaker_D | Only the television .
"[16:24] Speaker_A | Well it says only for television here , huh ."
[16:30] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[16:31] Speaker_D | So yeah , then you can yeah ."
"[16:33] Speaker_D | Requirements , no ? Functions ."
[16:36] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[16:39] Speaker_C | Standby options , yeah ?"
[16:44] Speaker_C | Uh yeah .
"[16:55] Speaker_C | Two s two two digits , oh okay ."
"[16:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
[16:58] Speaker_C | Yeah I understand what you mean . Yeah .
"[16:59] Speaker_D | I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed"
"[17:08] Speaker_C | It makes it twelve , yeah ."
[17:10] Speaker_B | Yeah . S
[17:10] Speaker_C | Indeed . Okay .
"[17:14] Speaker_C | Well , not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get"
[17:14] Speaker_D | to user .
[17:25] Speaker_D | So that it easy and fast .
[17:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:36] Speaker_B | Yeah , so you should have that one on ."
"[17:38] Speaker_C | Uh yeah , think so ."
"[17:39] Speaker_D | Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ?"
[17:41] Speaker_B | Mute misschien also .
[17:43] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[17:43] Speaker_A | Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus ."
"[17:47] Speaker_D | Forties , okay because because younger people as"
"[17:53] Speaker_D | Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen ."
"[18:12] Speaker_D | Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again ."
[18:18] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:19] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[18:23] Speaker_C | Yeah , we we could yeah . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . A touch screen uh probably uh even more ."
"[18:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[18:37] Speaker_D | True .
"[18:42] Speaker_C | Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ?"
"[18:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen ."
"[18:55] Speaker_D | Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . And if the only f"
[19:02] Speaker_C | So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .
"[19:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five ."
[19:09] Speaker_C | Yeah but uh will we not uh
"[19:15] Speaker_D | Yeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen ."
"[19:18] Speaker_C | Is it possible to find out , anyway ? You know ?"
"[19:19] Speaker_D | No , I don't have any costs here , I only have percentages ."
"[19:24] Speaker_B | But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen ."
[19:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:33] Speaker_C | No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . Um just uh displays several buttons , for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen ."
[19:39] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
"[19:51] Speaker_B | Oh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen ."
"[19:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone ."
"[19:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah ."
[20:00] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah .
"[20:01] Speaker_B | Yeah alright , oh right ."
[20:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[20:05] Speaker_A | So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?
[20:08] Speaker_B | Yeah . Would be yeah .
"[20:08] Speaker_D | I think it's the most easier thing , yeah ."
[20:10] Speaker_A | And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive .
[20:13] Speaker_D | No .
[20:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:14] Speaker_B | Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? Yeah . I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is ."
[20:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:16] Speaker_C | Twelve fifty .
[20:34] Speaker_D | Highly .
[20:35] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[20:40] Speaker_B | But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?"
"[20:47] Speaker_D | Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty ."
[20:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:07] Speaker_B | But if they also buy it then it's alright .
[21:10] Speaker_B | I guess .
"[21:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger ."
[21:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:16] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[21:17] Speaker_A | Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ?"
[21:18] Speaker_B | An Yes .
[21:20] Speaker_C | Mm . It's treasure . I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales .
[21:20] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:21] Speaker_A | And what else ?
"[21:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons ."
[21:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens ."
"[21:38] Speaker_D | N nothing , no costs at all ."
"[21:40] Speaker_C | Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder ."
[21:49] Speaker_D | I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything .
[21:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:55] Speaker_C | Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert .
"[21:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it ."
[21:59] Speaker_B | Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive .
"[22:01] Speaker_C | Yeah sure , sure ."
[22:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:04] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay . But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay ."
"[22:05] Speaker_D | Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly ."
[22:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy ."
"[22:16] Speaker_B | Oh , that's a bit of a problem ."
[22:16] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[22:20] Speaker_C | It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen ."
"[22:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen ."
[22:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes ."
"[22:29] Speaker_B | Oh , alright , I thought that you said that ."
[22:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[22:36] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[22:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , of course ."
[22:38] Speaker_C | And then not yeah .
"[22:39] Speaker_D | And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it ."
[22:43] Speaker_C | Um .
[22:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:54] Speaker_C | Mm . Okay ?
"[22:56] Speaker_A | Okay , what else does our remote need ?"
[22:57] Speaker_B | A mute button .
[23:00] Speaker_A | Mute button .
"[23:01] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection ,"
[23:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:10] Speaker_D | and power s power usage .
[23:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:16] Speaker_B | But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?
[23:19] Speaker_D | Sorry ?
"[23:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , it could be ."
"[23:25] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext ."
"[23:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , teletext ."
[23:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , or not ?"
"[23:39] Speaker_D | Less important . Yeah , should be there , but not press Yeah , sub-menu , yeah ."
"[23:40] Speaker_C | A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh ,"
"[23:51] Speaker_C | to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure . Indeed . So uh you can mount uh the the the uh"
"[23:56] Speaker_B | Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah ."
[23:56] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:04] Speaker_C | uh the remote control to um
[24:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:06] Speaker_D | Charted .
"[24:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , so Yeah ."
"[24:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay , because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast ."
[24:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:16] Speaker_D | Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things .
[24:18] Speaker_B | You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .
[24:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:24] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
"[24:26] Speaker_B | You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh I don't know ."
[24:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[24:33] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down ."
[24:40] Speaker_B | Nee that's that's uh yeah .
[24:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:49] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it yeah ."
"[24:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , automatically . After two minutes or three minutes , something like that ."
"[24:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah ."
[24:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .
[24:58] Speaker_C | Yeah . Sure .
"[25:00] Speaker_D | Yeah . And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger ."
[25:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:09] Speaker_C | Mm .
[25:13] Speaker_A | So we are going for the for the recharger .
[25:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , if it's ."
[25:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
[25:19] Speaker_D | Uh .
[25:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then ."
"[25:36] Speaker_C | Yeah sure , of course ."
"[25:36] Speaker_B | But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember ."
"[25:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , then you have a problem ."
[25:42] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's right .
[25:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:44] Speaker_D | Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .
[25:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:50] Speaker_D | So .
[25:54] Speaker_D | Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen .
[25:57] Speaker_D | High power usage .
"[25:58] Speaker_C | High power user cell , i"
"[26:01] Speaker_C | uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions ."
[26:06] Speaker_D | Yes .
[26:13] Speaker_D | True .
[26:15] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[26:16] Speaker_D | True .
[26:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , you made a point there ."
"[26:25] Speaker_A | Yeah , also ."
"[26:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , otherwise all your yeah ."
"[26:35] Speaker_D | Just a small device . Plug it in , that's it . Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something ."
[26:36] Speaker_C | Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big .
[26:36] Speaker_B | Yeah . I think everything has it for and I guess .
"[26:40] Speaker_C | Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , just u"
[26:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:48] Speaker_C | Okay .
[26:48] Speaker_B | Alright .
"[26:49] Speaker_A | Okay , well I've"
"[26:49] Speaker_D | It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition ."
"[26:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , you have some more"
[26:54] Speaker_A | points .
[26:59] Speaker_D | I think .
[27:05] Speaker_D | Also .
[27:12] Speaker_D | Well I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons . Yeah ? Okay .
[27:15] Speaker_C | Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify .
"[27:21] Speaker_C | Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . Okay ."
[27:31] Speaker_A | And you said something about speech recognition ?
[27:33] Speaker_C | Speech recognition ? Hello . Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty .
"[27:36] Speaker_D | Twelve . That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent ."
[27:45] Speaker_B | So it's pretty big .
"[27:46] Speaker_C | Well , spread it by a big market ."
[27:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[27:58] Speaker_D | Yeah . Ninety . Twenty five .
[28:01] Speaker_C | Yeah Yeah .
[28:03] Speaker_C | Turn volume up .
[28:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:07] Speaker_B | Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno ."
"[28:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , twelve ."
[28:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:17] Speaker_D | Yeah . Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says .
"[28:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , mm ."
"[28:24] Speaker_B | Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ?"
[28:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:36] Speaker_A | Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ?"
[28:40] Speaker_C | Why not ?
"[28:41] Speaker_A | Yeah , well , maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh ."
[28:41] Speaker_C | Why not ?
[28:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:46] Speaker_C | Let's hope uh to have some uh d
"[28:47] Speaker_D | No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen ."
[29:06] Speaker_A | But would it be useful to imple implement both ?
[29:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[29:11] Speaker_A | Yeah , I dunno ."
[29:16] Speaker_D | Nee .
"[29:17] Speaker_D | If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah ."
"[29:19] Speaker_B | Yeah , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ?"
[29:19] Speaker_C | We should do it . Yeah . Sure .
[29:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:26] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[29:27] Speaker_C | Certain systems already exist , I think ."
[29:29] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[29:34] Speaker_C | True , yeah ."
[29:35] Speaker_D | Yeah . True .
[29:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:37] Speaker_D | But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something ."
"[29:38] Speaker_C | This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . Yeah ."
"[29:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's right ."
[29:45] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:46] Speaker_C | Right .
[29:47] Speaker_C | Swahili . Swahili .
[29:48] Speaker_B | Yeah you can use icons for the
[29:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:51] Speaker_D | Ja , well possible ."
[29:52] Speaker_C | Indeed .
[29:54] Speaker_B | But if that's better than language for the for the remote .
"[29:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah yeah yeah ."
[29:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[29:58] Speaker_C | So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay .
[29:59] Speaker_B | Then it's Yeah .
[30:02] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[30:03] Speaker_D | 'Kay , what else ?"
"[30:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , we have to keep Yeah ."
"[30:09] Speaker_C | Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done ."
"[30:11] Speaker_A | Yeah , and then we have different languages ."
"[30:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , that should be uh anything matters ."
"[30:25] Speaker_B | Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing ."
[30:26] Speaker_D | I think it's difficult .
[30:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:31] Speaker_D | I think it's very differen difficult .
[30:32] Speaker_B | And you have to speak the so that it can understand .
[30:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , 's an option , yes ."
"[30:44] Speaker_C | Yeah , sure , indeed ."
[30:45] Speaker_D | Fifty Euro cents .
[30:48] Speaker_C | For speech recognition .
[30:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:51] Speaker_A | Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons"
[31:25] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[31:30] Speaker_D | Mm , yes ."
[31:31] Speaker_A | in general .
[31:39] Speaker_D | Curved ?
[31:45] Speaker_C | Uh yeah .
"[31:46] Speaker_B | I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport ."
[31:46] Speaker_D | Um .
[31:49] Speaker_C | S Shortcuts . Uh .
"[31:52] Speaker_D | I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus ."
[32:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[32:01] Speaker_D | D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . It should be available but not"
"[32:10] Speaker_C | Sh Yeah , just just sub-menu . Yeah . Not directly uh available . Okay ."
[32:12] Speaker_B | 'Cause it should be there .
[32:14] Speaker_D | not Yeah .
[32:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:23] Speaker_C | Mm .
[32:24] Speaker_B | So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there .
"[32:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , but s"
[32:27] Speaker_C | Directly available . So does it confuse uh the user ?
[32:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:30] Speaker_D | They'd have to be easy to use .
[32:31] Speaker_C | Uh . I'll search um .
"[32:34] Speaker_C | If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available ."
[32:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:42] Speaker_D | The sign of it .
"[32:43] Speaker_A | Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ?"
"[32:46] Speaker_D | Uh , no . What else can you do with a television ?"
[32:46] Speaker_B | I guess not .
[32:46] Speaker_C | No .
[32:49] Speaker_B | We've got anon
[32:49] Speaker_A | Aren't we forgetting something very important ?
"[32:51] Speaker_B | Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing ."
"[32:55] Speaker_D | Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there ."
"[32:59] Speaker_D | Yes , so this is your presentation ."
[33:04] Speaker_D | We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .
[33:09] Speaker_D | Which ones were yours ?
[33:18] Speaker_A | Ping .
[33:19] Speaker_D | Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay .
[33:24] Speaker_B | I guess we've got them all .
"[33:25] Speaker_D | Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I Yeah ."
"[33:33] Speaker_D | Very slow . Yeah , the zoom buttons ."
[33:36] Speaker_B | And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ?
"[33:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , yeah different uh Yeah ."
"[33:41] Speaker_B | Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing ."
[33:47] Speaker_C | Menu .
"[33:48] Speaker_D | Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something ."
"[33:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings ."
[33:51] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[33:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have ."
[33:55] Speaker_B | Oh right .
[33:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:58] Speaker_D | Channel settings .
"[34:01] Speaker_D | So those four , and of course the main ."
[34:05] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
"[34:07] Speaker_D | Like tap screens or something or , I dunno ."
[34:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:19] Speaker_D | No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it ."
[34:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:27] Speaker_B | We don't have to use that top . Yeah .
"[34:29] Speaker_D | Yeah . So you leave it alone . Yeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version ."
[34:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[34:43] Speaker_B | And and the buttons , should they have colours ?"
[34:43] Speaker_D | Colours . Yeah .
[34:45] Speaker_C | Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g
[34:46] Speaker_B | Oh but we don't have any buttons .
[34:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[34:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , then defines itself ."
[34:52] Speaker_D | Because uh how many percent ? Eighty percent ?
"[34:55] Speaker_B | They think it's ugly , right ?"
[34:57] Speaker_D | Would spend more money if it looks fancy .
[35:07] Speaker_C | Okay . Twelve Euro fifty .
"[35:12] Speaker_C | Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? Sure ."
[35:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:20] Speaker_D | Rasta colours .
[35:21] Speaker_A | And a see-through uh
"[35:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , see through version . Yeah ."
"[35:26] Speaker_D | If you press a button , it turns green ."
[35:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[35:28] Speaker_A | Okay , well that's the"
[35:29] Speaker_B | A disco version .
"[35:31] Speaker_A | signal for las final five minutes . Um so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?"
[35:31] Speaker_B | Five minutes ?
[35:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:44] Speaker_D | Channel settings ?
"[35:45] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , right . So you can program the T_V_ ."
[35:45] Speaker_A | Channel settings .
[35:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[35:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[35:49] Speaker_D | Mm .
[35:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . Could be possible .
[36:00] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[36:01] Speaker_D | Or like uh you have a menu button , you press Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings ."
"[36:02] Speaker_A | No , we said teletext also a separate menu ."
[36:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[36:11] Speaker_A | Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess . So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons and"
"[36:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , no problem . Yep ."
[36:25] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[36:29] Speaker_C | No .
[36:33] Speaker_B | Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote .
[36:36] Speaker_B | Which one ?
"[36:40] Speaker_B | But that's also in the L_C_D_ , right ?"
"[36:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ?"
"[36:42] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , th"
"[36:43] Speaker_B | So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No , alright ."
[36:47] Speaker_B | Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
[36:48] Speaker_A | But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself .
"[36:53] Speaker_D | Mm , no ."
"[36:53] Speaker_B | No , no ."
[36:54] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[36:56] Speaker_B | Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have ."
"[37:01] Speaker_C | Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control ."
[37:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[37:13] Speaker_D | No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically ."
"[37:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . No ."
"[37:31] Speaker_B | But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah ."
"[37:33] Speaker_A | Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ?"
[37:41] Speaker_B | No you just tap I think .
"[37:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , you tap . Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on ."
[37:42] Speaker_C | Just tap it .
"[37:43] Speaker_A | Tap the thing . Okay . And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? Sure ."
"[37:48] Speaker_D | No , just the remote . A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not ."
[38:03] Speaker_D | Separate .
"[38:12] Speaker_C | A A A normal button on the remote control , or norm ?"
"[38:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . To turn it on ."
[38:18] Speaker_B | Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen .
"[38:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on ."
"[38:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , I have , yeah ."
[38:29] Speaker_C | Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?
"[38:32] Speaker_B | Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want ."
"[38:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button ."
[38:55] Speaker_C | Mm .
[38:58] Speaker_B | Oh right .
[38:59] Speaker_C | I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .
"[39:01] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah ."
"[39:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Okay , well I guess we have to"
[39:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[39:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[39:15] Speaker_A | postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break ,"
[39:23] Speaker_C | Oh .
[39:35] Speaker_C | Mm .
[39:46] Speaker_B | Alright .
[39:50] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[39:59] Speaker_B | Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ?"
"[40:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , think so ."
[40:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .

[00:02] Speaker_A | Hello .
[00:03] Speaker_D | Hey guys .
[00:04] Speaker_B | Hi .
[00:05] Speaker_A | Hi .
[00:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[00:09] Speaker_A | It's too beautiful .
"[00:10] Speaker_B | Yeah , true ."
[00:13] Speaker_D | Too wicked .
[00:15] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[00:22] Speaker_A | A minute please , my uh laptop is uh oh , there it is , thank you ."
[00:44] Speaker_A | So welcome back .
"[00:51] Speaker_A | the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um"
"[02:07] Speaker_A | Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want . So uh"
"[02:59] Speaker_A | Tim , can you start ?"
[03:02] Speaker_D | Okay .
[03:02] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[03:29] Speaker_D | 'Kay , welcome . I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level ,"
[03:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[03:38] Speaker_D | which I will show you .
[03:58] Speaker_D | and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results .
"[04:06] Speaker_D | Um ,"
"[04:09] Speaker_D | these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um ,"
"[04:15] Speaker_D | we have three audiences of two audiences , I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent ."
"[04:47] Speaker_D | Mm and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um"
[05:07] Speaker_D | speech recognition .
"[05:10] Speaker_D | I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um , and when you see uh the audience ,"
"[05:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies ."
[05:29] Speaker_D | Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion
[05:57] Speaker_D | So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer .
"[06:04] Speaker_D | Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um , persons were asked"
"[06:28] Speaker_D | uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . Switching channels , um yeah ,"
[06:33] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[06:50] Speaker_D | that's pretty uh
"[06:53] Speaker_D | pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear ."
[07:14] Speaker_A | But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet .
"[07:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[07:21] Speaker_A | So that that's strange .
"[07:29] Speaker_D | Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . So uh , when you ask people , what do they use ,"
"[07:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[07:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:40] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
[07:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:46] Speaker_D | That's a ne i it It's a new technology , but it's not incorporated right now ."
[07:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:51] Speaker_D | Okay , my personal preferences . Um ,"
[07:55] Speaker_D | I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five .
"[08:01] Speaker_D | Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um ,"
"[08:17] Speaker_D | yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls ."
"[08:37] Speaker_D | Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh"
"[08:47] Speaker_D | get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in ."
"[08:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's a cool idea ."
"[09:04] Speaker_D | that's about it , I think . Yeah ."
"[09:06] Speaker_C | When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ?"
[09:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:26] Speaker_C | Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons ."
[09:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:40] Speaker_C | Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example ."
"[09:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , perhaps . Just for the minor functions perhaps ."
[09:50] Speaker_C | Thank you .
"[09:52] Speaker_C | Yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea ."
"[09:54] Speaker_D | Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn ."
[09:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:00] Speaker_D | Yeah ?
"[10:02] Speaker_D | 'Kay , that's it ."
"[10:04] Speaker_A | Thank you , Tim ."
"[10:06] Speaker_C | Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure ."
"[10:24] Speaker_C | Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off ."
"[11:08] Speaker_C | Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us ."
"[12:33] Speaker_D | What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?"
"[12:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , actually I have t"
[12:44] Speaker_D | So it's in the wrong product .
"[12:46] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one ."
[12:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:35] Speaker_C | So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something ."
"[14:19] Speaker_C | So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those ."
"[15:34] Speaker_D | Um ,"
"[15:36] Speaker_D | yeah , maybe another problem uh ,"
[15:39] Speaker_D | I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .
[15:47] Speaker_D | Huh .
[15:51] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[15:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:36] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[16:36] Speaker_A | Okay , thank you Janus ."
"[16:37] Speaker_B | Yes , I can go ahead . Last presentation . Okay ."
"[16:38] Speaker_A | You do ? The last presentation . You have plenty of time , Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , so uh take your time ."
[16:48] Speaker_A | If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh
[16:53] Speaker_A | warn you .
"[16:59] Speaker_B | Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions ."
[17:49] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[18:03] Speaker_B | And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you you can use remote like this with all the functions ,"
[18:08] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[18:59] Speaker_B | that's very important .
"[19:03] Speaker_B | Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying ."
[19:18] Speaker_B | and um
"[19:30] Speaker_A | Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh you you want to keep it simple , but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one ."
"[19:38] Speaker_B | Yeah , and so that's where the difficulties lie ."
"[19:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use um many buttons . So um weighing those factors ."
[19:58] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[20:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:07] Speaker_D | Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um ,"
[20:21] Speaker_D | Uh yeah .
[20:22] Speaker_B | The doesn't .
"[20:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , this ? No ? Yeah . Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh"
"[20:33] Speaker_D | channel switching , and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down ."
[20:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users ."
[20:52] Speaker_D | Mm .
[21:03] Speaker_D | Nah .
[21:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:19] Speaker_D | I think so too , but and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ ."
"[21:38] Speaker_B | Yeah , that will be a problem ."
[21:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:40] Speaker_C | Well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . And that would be uh a considerable problem ."
[21:55] Speaker_B | Yes .
[21:56] Speaker_B | So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh
"[22:05] Speaker_B | well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . Use big clear buttons . Not too many ."
[22:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:15] Speaker_B | So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um"
[22:34] Speaker_C | Not embed
"[22:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something ."
"[22:41] Speaker_B | And yeah , if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . Not first change menu options or switch something . Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low ."
[22:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:04] Speaker_B | And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions ."
[23:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:49] Speaker_D | Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen"
"[23:55] Speaker_D | um is very good . Um ,"
[23:59] Speaker_D | because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about
"[24:06] Speaker_D | uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um"
"[24:23] Speaker_D | and that's a big ad advantage I think , because"
[24:28] Speaker_D | one the one hand uh
[24:31] Speaker_D | you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . It's uh
[24:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:42] Speaker_D | very visual intended .
"[24:50] Speaker_B | Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh"
[24:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:32] Speaker_D | Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea"
[25:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:36] Speaker_D | then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
[25:40] Speaker_C | The extra functions .
"[25:41] Speaker_B | The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them ."
[25:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:50] Speaker_D | Ah okay .
"[25:58] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think so ."
[26:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:13] Speaker_B | Well um then I'd like to make a proposal .
"[26:21] Speaker_B | If you make one big touch screen ,"
[26:23] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[26:24] Speaker_B | use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest ."
[26:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on ."
[26:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:47] Speaker_B | Yes .
[26:50] Speaker_C | Uh uh I think that will be great .
[26:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
[26:53] Speaker_A | So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
"[26:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think so ."
[26:59] Speaker_A | Jirun ?
"[27:00] Speaker_B | Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen ."
"[27:11] Speaker_D | Yeah , of course ."
[27:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:12] Speaker_B | And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions ."
[27:17] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah yeah .
[27:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:34] Speaker_D | Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,"
[27:40] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[27:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:55] Speaker_B | Yeah wh
[27:57] Speaker_B | Is that possible to use or no ?
"[28:02] Speaker_B | Well , yeah well , does it have to depend on the television ?"
"[28:04] Speaker_D | Ju just a simple log-in , something like that ."
"[28:06] Speaker_C | Well , y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern ."
[28:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:22] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[28:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[28:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[28:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[28:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh"
[28:56] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[29:00] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[29:05] Speaker_D | vi violent channel , uh m my ki my kids uh I don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,"
"[29:06] Speaker_B | Oh , something like that ."
[29:06] Speaker_C | Yes .
[29:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:14] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , that would b"
"[29:14] Speaker_A | Okay , yeah ."
"[29:20] Speaker_D | Yeah okay , but but yeah , that's just"
[29:23] Speaker_D | that's an a an added feature .
[29:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[29:25] Speaker_A | Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible ."
[29:41] Speaker_D | Partial .
[29:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:02] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[30:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers"
"[30:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . You can display actual buttons on the touch screens ."
[30:17] Speaker_D | that's just as e just as easy .
"[30:19] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true ."
[30:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
"[30:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's different ."
[30:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep ."
"[30:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , age b below forty ."
[30:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[30:43] Speaker_A | They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true ."
"[30:45] Speaker_D | A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications ."
[30:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[30:57] Speaker_D | I th I think we can do that too .
[30:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:01] Speaker_A | Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done ."
[31:07] Speaker_D | Done .
[31:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[31:37] Speaker_A | Moment . Ooh .
"[31:52] Speaker_A | Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh"
[32:41] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[32:42] Speaker_A | we discussed .
[32:42] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[32:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ ."
"[32:50] Speaker_B | Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t"
"[32:59] Speaker_D | Yeah , but that's not possible ."
"[33:05] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , mm yeah ."
[33:20] Speaker_D | Add th that that's an opportunity .
"[33:26] Speaker_B | Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these ."
[33:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:34] Speaker_A | Okay .
[33:37] Speaker_A | And it's not too complex to do it .
[33:40] Speaker_D | No .
[33:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Oh um mo no , you can just say uh the c"
[34:08] Speaker_D | No no no .
[34:10] Speaker_A | Just build it in .
[34:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:18] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[34:21] Speaker_B | In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options ."
[34:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:31] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yeah .
"[34:34] Speaker_C | Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah ."
[34:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[34:37] Speaker_D | Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , so that if you yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh"
[34:43] Speaker_B | Memory in the in the remote .

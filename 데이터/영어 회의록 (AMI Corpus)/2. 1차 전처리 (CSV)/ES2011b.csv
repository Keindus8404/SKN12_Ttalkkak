[00:31] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[00:33] Speaker_A | 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure ."
[01:22] Speaker_D | And I can start if you want . Mm .
[01:26] Speaker_D | Is there an order ? No . We haven't decided on an order .
[01:28] Speaker_A | Hm ?
"[01:30] Speaker_A | No , any any order's fine . Yeah ."
"[01:30] Speaker_D | First . Okay . Um , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in ."
"[01:38] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , sorry ."
"[01:47] Speaker_D | Is that it ? Can you see ? Oh , here . Okay ."
[01:53] Speaker_D | So what happens it doesn't work ?
[01:55] Speaker_A | It sh it takes a few seconds I think .
[02:13] Speaker_D | No .
[02:15] Speaker_D | Is it in the right thing ?
"[02:15] Speaker_B | But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight ."
"[02:22] Speaker_D | Oh wait , um ."
"[02:28] Speaker_A | Uh-huh , and then press function ."
[02:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:32] Speaker_A | and F_ eight .
[02:36] Speaker_C | Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh .
"[02:38] Speaker_D | Oh , wait . That's is that it ?"
[02:40] Speaker_B | Adjusting .
[02:42] Speaker_A | Here we are .
"[02:45] Speaker_B | The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it ."
"[02:47] Speaker_D | Right here we are . We're here . Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um"
[02:49] Speaker_A | Oh . Is it on ? Okay .
"[02:59] Speaker_D | a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue ."
[03:47] Speaker_A | Hm .
"[03:48] Speaker_D | Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um"
"[04:11] Speaker_D | yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um ,"
"[04:40] Speaker_D | about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together ."
[05:37] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[05:41] Speaker_D | Shall I what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?
[05:44] Speaker_A | Yeah . Just move right on .
[05:49] Speaker_C | Right .
[05:52] Speaker_C | So get this .
"[06:17] Speaker_C | Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?"
[06:22] Speaker_D | Function F_ eight .
[06:29] Speaker_C | 'Kay . What's function ?
[06:31] Speaker_A | It's the little blue w it's the one th yeah .
"[06:33] Speaker_C | Oh function , I see it ."
[06:37] Speaker_C | There we go .
[06:45] Speaker_A | It should be yeah .
[06:50] Speaker_C | Okay . Um .
[07:03] Speaker_C | just what what functions we need and how to make that
[07:08] Speaker_C | the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um so I think things like uh
"[07:29] Speaker_C | you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to"
[08:34] Speaker_C | And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
[09:05] Speaker_C | Okay . You need the little thingy .
[09:24] Speaker_C | Ooh .
[10:09] Speaker_D | That's on view . Oh .
[10:11] Speaker_B | Right .
"[10:14] Speaker_B | Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting ."
"[10:28] Speaker_B | Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is ."
"[10:51] Speaker_B | So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall ."
"[11:26] Speaker_B | And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip ,"
"[11:33] Speaker_B | um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up ."
"[12:01] Speaker_B | Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation ."
[12:35] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[12:37] Speaker_B | Mm ?
"[12:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here ."
"[12:48] Speaker_A | Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,"
"[13:12] Speaker_A | also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the"
"[13:34] Speaker_A | phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um ."
"[13:57] Speaker_A | So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um ,"
[14:06] Speaker_A | yeah . Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some
[14:15] Speaker_C | Like in terms of
"[14:17] Speaker_C | how it looks , or like what it does ?"
[14:19] Speaker_A | wha what um well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
[14:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
[14:32] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
[14:40] Speaker_C | Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
[14:48] Speaker_B | It's easy to implement .
"[14:50] Speaker_C | Okay . So the yeah , yeah , yeah . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ?"
[14:53] Speaker_B | Locator .
"[14:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , teenagers and young professionals ."
[15:00] Speaker_D | Well that's for speech recognition .
[15:02] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[15:02] Speaker_A | Oh , uh ."
[15:02] Speaker_D | And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .
"[15:04] Speaker_B | I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it ."
[15:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:17] Speaker_A | Mm .
[15:17] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
"[15:22] Speaker_A | And if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah . Right so um yeah ."
[15:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , I'm happy with that . Completely ."
[15:34] Speaker_C | Hu yeah .
[15:39] Speaker_C | Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .
"[15:44] Speaker_B | Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably ."
[15:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:01] Speaker_C | Okay . Okay . Alright .
[16:02] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay .
[16:03] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:08] Speaker_A | So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right .
[16:12] Speaker_B | It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .
"[16:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[16:19] Speaker_D | So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?"
"[16:22] Speaker_B | Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button ."
[16:24] Speaker_D | Okay . Okay .
[16:26] Speaker_C | So it's now like a two-part thing . Okay . Alright .
"[16:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , so it would be a two part package ."
[16:29] Speaker_D | Okay .
[16:31] Speaker_C | So we get to design that too . Make it fashionable .
"[16:35] Speaker_C | Um , okay ."
[16:38] Speaker_A | So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Huh .
[16:44] Speaker_B | Yeah I think so .
[16:45] Speaker_D | Yeah . Just there .
[16:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:47] Speaker_D | Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?
[16:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:05] Speaker_D | Okay .
[17:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:10] Speaker_C | Then it can live anywhere .
[17:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:12] Speaker_D | Okay . For the so you have that button , that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?"
[17:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:21] Speaker_D | Are we just having a radio ?
"[17:21] Speaker_B | Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever ."
[17:23] Speaker_D | On the phone .
[17:26] Speaker_D | You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah yeah .
[17:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:34] Speaker_A | And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so yeah ."
[17:39] Speaker_C | So i Yeah .
[17:47] Speaker_D | So need the other buttons . So we have this mm .
"[17:51] Speaker_A | So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them , yeah you you did um , they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television ."
[17:55] Speaker_C | That was that was me .
[18:04] Speaker_C | I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . And uh
[18:07] Speaker_A | Oh really .
"[18:09] Speaker_A | 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities ."
[18:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:15] Speaker_B | Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ?
[18:19] Speaker_A | They're not no .
"[18:20] Speaker_D | They're not , no ."
"[18:21] Speaker_B | Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s ."
"[18:22] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right , yeah . But D_V_D_ probably is ."
"[18:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , other than that region and coding thing ."
"[18:30] Speaker_A | And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days ."
"[18:36] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , for sure ."
"[18:37] Speaker_C | Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a"
[18:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:53] Speaker_C | you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ ."
[18:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:57] Speaker_D | Well for sure we need the um I think we can just design the
"[19:04] Speaker_D | channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red ."
[19:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:07] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[19:08] Speaker_A | Huh .
[19:09] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:26] Speaker_D | Oh okay , yeah ."
"[19:27] Speaker_C | It seems like that would be hard though . I mean , like because unless you know yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . Yeah . B Yeah ."
[19:31] Speaker_A | It might be confusing . Yeah .
[19:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:37] Speaker_A | Besides you like to be able to go power . I have the power I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .
[19:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:45] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:46] Speaker_D | Well even um iPod thing , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number ,"
"[19:55] Speaker_D | of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of"
"[20:01] Speaker_C | That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah ."
"[20:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , it's it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know ."
[20:14] Speaker_A | Mm .
[20:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:27] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah , it's just and it's one thing which has everything ."
"[20:29] Speaker_C | Yeah , and it is yeah . It is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?"
"[20:37] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner ."
[20:39] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .
[20:45] Speaker_A | Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of okay .
[20:46] Speaker_C | Like a disc .
[20:48] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah . It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .
"[20:50] Speaker_D | It's like l this like that , and then you do that ."
[20:50] Speaker_A | I've never used one . No .
[20:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[20:56] Speaker_D | And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing"
[20:56] Speaker_C | Yeah and then .
[21:18] Speaker_A | Well i
[21:20] Speaker_C | zap . Okay .
"[21:22] Speaker_A | We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well ."
[21:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay .
"[21:34] Speaker_B | Doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around ."
[21:41] Speaker_D | What do you mean the function ?
"[21:46] Speaker_C | I dunno , I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where"
[21:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:57] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[22:02] Speaker_C | like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down ."
[22:11] Speaker_D | Yeah but it knows for some reason . The iPod knows .
[22:14] Speaker_C | It just kno the iPod knows . S
[22:17] Speaker_C | Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .
[22:18] Speaker_A | Huh .
[22:19] Speaker_B | I don't have one .
"[22:21] Speaker_D | Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up ."
[22:24] Speaker_C | Okay . That's what I mean . Okay .
"[22:26] Speaker_C | Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down ."
[22:27] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[22:31] Speaker_D | And then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen ."
[22:36] Speaker_A | You can o
[22:39] Speaker_A | And you
[22:47] Speaker_C | It's like a b
[22:50] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[22:52] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[22:54] Speaker_A | Right .
[22:55] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[23:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:15] Speaker_C | I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of yeah , I dunno , I dunno . You don't think so ? Okay ."
[23:17] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah .
[23:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:27] Speaker_B | I don't think it's the wheel dealy .
[23:29] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .
[23:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:29] Speaker_C | Okay .
[23:34] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:34] Speaker_C | Yeah . I'm thinking we could if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .
"[23:37] Speaker_B | And they're re-programmable aren't they ? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers ."
[23:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[23:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:54] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah .
"[23:55] Speaker_D | Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing ,"
"[24:09] Speaker_D | find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume oh we've ts just said that ."
[24:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:14] Speaker_A | Mm .
[24:16] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:24] Speaker_D | Channel selection .
"[24:30] Speaker_B | A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,"
[24:33] Speaker_D | Menu .
[24:36] Speaker_B | and menu maybe .
[24:42] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[24:44] Speaker_C | Okay .
[24:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:50] Speaker_A | But s yeah uh .
[24:50] Speaker_D | But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .
[24:54] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:55] Speaker_B | But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch ."
"[24:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , yeah ."
"[24:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[25:00] Speaker_A | Mm . Mm .
[25:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:10] Speaker_B | Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .
"[25:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , it is only fun"
"[25:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad ."
[25:13] Speaker_A | But i
[25:18] Speaker_B | Oh . But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .
[25:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:48] Speaker_A | Um , yeah , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . Um let's see . Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . See you soon ."
[25:48] Speaker_B | Yes we can try that .

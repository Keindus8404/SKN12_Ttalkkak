[00:33] Speaker_A | Okay . Hi Team . Hope you had a good lunch . Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . Um let's get started .
"[00:42] Speaker_A | 'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again ."
"[01:01] Speaker_A | 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control ."
[01:10] Speaker_A | Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ?
[01:19] Speaker_B | Just trying to move mine right now .
[01:20] Speaker_A | Okay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? Okay .
[01:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:28] Speaker_A | Trend watching ?
[01:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:30] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[01:40] Speaker_D | Okay , so trend watching ."
"[02:21] Speaker_B | They want everything , but simply . Okay ."
"[02:23] Speaker_D | Yes . Exactly . So we can go to next . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean . Yeah ."
[02:27] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
[02:51] Speaker_A | Mm . Mm .
[02:59] Speaker_A | Right . Yes .
"[03:00] Speaker_D | Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , because Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now ."
[03:07] Speaker_A | Right .
[03:11] Speaker_A | Right . People don't buy a new remote every so often .
"[03:16] Speaker_B | I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation ."
"[03:20] Speaker_D | Okay . Awesome . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product ."
[03:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:18] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[04:20] Speaker_A | Very good . I like it . Okay , ready for the next slide ?"
[04:25] Speaker_A | Op mm 'kay .
[04:27] Speaker_A | Great . Great presentation .
[04:31] Speaker_A | Ready ?
[04:33] Speaker_C | Okay hang on .
[04:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[04:36] Speaker_C | See if it's there .
[04:49] Speaker_A | Which one is it ?
[04:56] Speaker_A | Interface concepts new .
"[04:58] Speaker_C | Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on ."
[05:02] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[05:03] Speaker_B | Mine will always read copy of something or other . I I copied mine before I sent it over .
[05:05] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[05:08] Speaker_A | Oh okay .
"[05:09] Speaker_C | Sorry , hang on ."
[05:12] Speaker_C | Don't know .
[05:28] Speaker_A | Oh there we go .
[05:29] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[05:43] Speaker_C | Okay , um looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide ."
[05:53] Speaker_A | Sure .
"[05:54] Speaker_C | Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and"
"[06:28] Speaker_C | um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of"
"[06:41] Speaker_C | look into it , but Anyway , next ."
[06:42] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
"[06:44] Speaker_C | Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up ."
[07:08] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[07:13] Speaker_C | Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . Okay ."
[07:22] Speaker_A | Mm .
[07:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
[07:46] Speaker_D | That's cute .
[08:11] Speaker_C | uh keep them away from other channels .
"[08:13] Speaker_C | So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . Um ."
[08:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:39] Speaker_C | So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction ."
[08:47] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[09:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:00] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[09:01] Speaker_A | No .
"[09:11] Speaker_A | Mm . Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever ."
[09:15] Speaker_C | Right .
[09:16] Speaker_D | I have four of those remotes .
[09:21] Speaker_C | That's it .
[09:24] Speaker_A | Great job .
"[09:26] Speaker_B | Okay , my turn ."
[09:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:29] Speaker_B | Whoo .
[09:29] Speaker_A | What's the title ?
[09:31] Speaker_B | It'll be copy of component design .
[09:34] Speaker_A | Got it .
[09:38] Speaker_B | Yeah . Th that looks like it .
"[09:43] Speaker_B | 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said Next slide , please ."
"[10:17] Speaker_B | Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself ."
"[10:44] Speaker_B | An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it ."
[11:38] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[11:40] Speaker_A | Interesting .
"[11:59] Speaker_B | Yeah . Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium . Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . I think I have one more slide . No , I didn't ."
[12:13] Speaker_D | What is that ?
[12:21] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
[12:32] Speaker_C | Right .
[12:40] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[12:42] Speaker_A | No , okay ."
"[12:43] Speaker_B | Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes ."
[13:35] Speaker_A | Mm .
[13:41] Speaker_D | Right .
"[13:45] Speaker_A | Hmm . Okay . Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions ."
[13:45] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:46] Speaker_B | And that's all I got .
[13:56] Speaker_A | Where were we ?
"[13:57] Speaker_C | Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition ."
[13:59] Speaker_A | Sure .
[14:05] Speaker_C | Um .
[14:06] Speaker_D | Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier .
"[14:08] Speaker_C | Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but"
"[14:26] Speaker_C | I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this ."
[14:38] Speaker_A | Mm .
[14:43] Speaker_A | Right . Right .
"[14:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . So that way the remote reads it ."
"[14:49] Speaker_C | Right , so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say ."
[14:55] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[14:58] Speaker_D | I feel like voice recognition would be ,"
[15:02] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[15:05] Speaker_A | Programme .
[15:11] Speaker_D | Technology .
[15:14] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[15:19] Speaker_B | But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . Yeah ."
"[15:24] Speaker_D | And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like"
[15:26] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[15:30] Speaker_D | the , I mean just like the more advanced it is ,"
[15:32] Speaker_D | the better it'll sell .
[15:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[15:34] Speaker_B | I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . So that we could reduce cost . Yeah ."
[15:44] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[15:48] Speaker_A | Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um ."
[15:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
[15:59] Speaker_A | Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?
"[16:08] Speaker_D | Oh the base , yeah ."
"[16:09] Speaker_A | The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?"
[16:11] Speaker_B | I think the p
[16:14] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[16:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . It's not gonna be a huge universal remote ."
[16:30] Speaker_C | Right .
"[16:36] Speaker_C | Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons ."
[16:51] Speaker_C | Are you gonna lose it easier ?
"[16:52] Speaker_D | But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that ."
[16:57] Speaker_B | That's true .
[16:58] Speaker_D | So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .
[17:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:07] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[17:13] Speaker_C | Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ?
"[17:17] Speaker_D | Two double A_s ,"
[17:19] Speaker_D | for this size .
"[17:23] Speaker_C | But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size ."
[17:26] Speaker_D | Right .
[17:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:38] Speaker_C | So we sh
"[17:39] Speaker_D | Smaller , without Yeah ."
"[17:41] Speaker_A | A battery like this guy . Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ?"
[17:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:42] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
"[17:48] Speaker_D | I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced ."
[17:52] Speaker_A | I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of
[17:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:54] Speaker_C | I'm a away from
[17:56] Speaker_C | the base . Yeah .
[17:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:06] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:06] Speaker_B | The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .
[18:13] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[18:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:16] Speaker_D | Ouch .
"[18:18] Speaker_D | A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt ."
"[18:21] Speaker_A | Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?"
[18:21] Speaker_B | Pieces everywhere .
"[18:25] Speaker_B | Well , we have lots of options . I don't think wood is a viable option ."
[18:27] Speaker_D | Yeah wood .
"[18:28] Speaker_A | No . Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead ."
"[18:29] Speaker_C | Well , titanium s I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then"
[18:36] Speaker_C | I would probably lean away from that .
"[18:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive ."
[18:41] Speaker_A | Right . What would you recommend ?
"[18:42] Speaker_B | However , well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right ? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , make them a rarity so to speak ."
[18:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:49] Speaker_C | That'll Yeah , exactly ."
[18:51] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[18:52] Speaker_C | The selling point , yeah ."
[18:59] Speaker_C | Are we restricted by this ?
[18:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:02] Speaker_A | I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of
[19:03] Speaker_C | Twenty five Euros
[19:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[19:13] Speaker_A | remotes . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think ."
[19:20] Speaker_B | Yeah . Good plan .
[19:20] Speaker_D | Good plan .
"[19:21] Speaker_A | Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ?"
[19:27] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[19:42] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[19:42] Speaker_D | Oh .
[19:44] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[19:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , who knows ."
[19:58] Speaker_C | So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ?
[19:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:05] Speaker_D | O or we could like take off this .
"[20:06] Speaker_A | They could buy cases , maybe ,"
"[20:07] Speaker_B | They could come back . And buy the extra case . So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start ."
[20:10] Speaker_C | Okay .
[20:10] Speaker_A | if they wanted . I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell
[20:14] Speaker_A | options .
[20:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:19] Speaker_C | The what the top face , right ?"
[20:21] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay .
"[20:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic ."
[20:30] Speaker_A | Right . Right .
"[20:33] Speaker_A | Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?"
[20:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:39] Speaker_A | I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . could we Yeah ."
"[20:46] Speaker_C | A tracker , yeah ."
"[20:48] Speaker_D | 'Cause that uh what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like ,"
[20:54] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[20:54] Speaker_D | because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .
[21:00] Speaker_A | Right .
"[21:01] Speaker_B | Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing ."
"[21:06] Speaker_D | Ooh . Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech ."
"[21:15] Speaker_C | Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . So it became highly irritating ."
"[21:24] Speaker_B | Yeah , see that would just irritate me ."
[21:29] Speaker_A | Oh dear .
"[21:29] Speaker_D | Oh , then maybe voice"
[21:30] Speaker_B | So I think having a key-phrase is much better .
[21:31] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:31] Speaker_D | maybe voice activation won't be good .
"[21:34] Speaker_A | Okay . Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? Just a Okay , alright ."
"[21:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder ."
[21:41] Speaker_B | No .
[21:42] Speaker_C | Hmm . Okay .
"[21:49] Speaker_D | Oh , brilliant then ."
"[21:54] Speaker_B | Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . Why not introduce it in this way ?"
[22:01] Speaker_A | No .
"[22:03] Speaker_D | Yeah , good point ."
[22:03] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
"[22:05] Speaker_A | Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?"
"[22:09] Speaker_D | I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter ."
[22:11] Speaker_A | Two ?
[22:12] Speaker_D | I mean more more come in a package . Yeah .
"[22:14] Speaker_C | Well , that depends on what the energy is needed ."
"[22:15] Speaker_B | I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? So they're more widely available now . And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . But if you only have to replace it every five years ."
"[22:34] Speaker_A | They're more expensive though , too ."
[22:38] Speaker_A | Mm .
[22:40] Speaker_D | That's a good point .
[22:41] Speaker_A | Thoughts anybody ?
[22:42] Speaker_C | As long as we sell it with it .
"[22:43] Speaker_B | Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . Yeah ."
"[22:48] Speaker_C | Right , that's what I meant ."
[22:50] Speaker_D | We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . We still have one more meeting .
[22:50] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah . Alright .
[23:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[23:01] Speaker_A | So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design ."
"[23:08] Speaker_C | What's it gonna Yeah , what's it gonna look like ."
"[23:10] Speaker_A | Okay . I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ?"
[23:11] Speaker_C | Um .
"[23:22] Speaker_A | It might be the four way scroll , too . I mean if Yeah ."
"[23:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle ."
[23:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:31] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[23:31] Speaker_C | Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?"
[23:38] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[23:38] Speaker_D | Oh , that's true ."
[23:45] Speaker_D | Good point .
"[23:46] Speaker_B | In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful ."
[23:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:59] Speaker_A | Oh , I see what you mean ."
[24:01] Speaker_A | I think so .
[24:02] Speaker_D | So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?
"[24:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , I like that . 'Kay ."
"[24:16] Speaker_D | But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled ."
[24:21] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[24:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , like on the side of it . Oh if it's just up and down ."
[24:25] Speaker_C | But is that for Which ?
[24:27] Speaker_B | Volume or channel . I don't know .
"[24:30] Speaker_D | Well , you could do some on both sides ."
[24:30] Speaker_C | Do we have both sides ?
"[24:32] Speaker_B | Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know ."
[24:33] Speaker_A | Can we ?
[24:38] Speaker_D | Yeah . That's squishy . That's squishy .
[24:39] Speaker_A | So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan
"[24:42] Speaker_C | Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side ."
[24:46] Speaker_A | Mm . Yeah .
[24:47] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[24:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , that ."
[24:50] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[24:59] Speaker_A | 'Kay any other ideas ?
[25:03] Speaker_C | Um what colour ?
"[25:06] Speaker_A | Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W"
[25:18] Speaker_C | Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
[25:25] Speaker_C | And that's at the bottom of it .
[25:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:27] Speaker_A | I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get"
[25:31] Speaker_C | Which button ?
[25:42] Speaker_A | another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ?
"[25:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea ."
[25:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:56] Speaker_A | Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ? They're not titanium . I kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool ."
[26:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[26:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , or like a gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black ."
[26:18] Speaker_A | What are your thoughts ? Gun-metal gray .
"[26:22] Speaker_A | There you go , gun-metal gray ."
[26:34] Speaker_C | I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
[26:37] Speaker_A | Why ?
"[26:39] Speaker_D | Yeah , buttons wear off ."
"[26:39] Speaker_C | What's the button Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ?"
[26:40] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[26:46] Speaker_C | I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing ."
[26:53] Speaker_A | Right .
[26:55] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[27:01] Speaker_D | But we want it to be seen . We need it to be seen .
"[27:01] Speaker_C | But you don't But uh , yeah , you don't see it ."
[27:01] Speaker_A | On the back ? It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery .
"[27:07] Speaker_C | Well , hang on ."
[27:15] Speaker_A | I can find it again .
"[27:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's like the second to last slide ."
[27:19] Speaker_A | Okay . And yours was called Interface Concept ?
"[27:21] Speaker_C | Interface , yeah ."
"[27:24] Speaker_A | This one ? Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly ."
[27:25] Speaker_C | Yeah . Um .
"[27:31] Speaker_C | Okay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in ."
[27:45] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[27:49] Speaker_A | Okay , yes yes ."
"[27:50] Speaker_C | If c you envisioning it ? And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes ."
[27:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[27:59] Speaker_B | The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be ."
[28:04] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[28:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
[28:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:13] Speaker_C | Right . That's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened ."
[28:15] Speaker_A | Okay .
[28:18] Speaker_D | Right .
"[28:21] Speaker_C | And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ?"
[28:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:33] Speaker_D | Some of tho
[28:33] Speaker_A | Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?
"[28:35] Speaker_D | Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . Well , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons ."
[28:37] Speaker_A | Mm .
[28:40] Speaker_A | Mm .
[28:45] Speaker_C | Yellow .
"[28:47] Speaker_A | Yellow , I like that idea ."
[28:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:52] Speaker_A | Mm .
[29:01] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[29:03] Speaker_C | Oh , that one ."
"[29:05] Speaker_A | I like the yellow illumination idea , very good ."
[29:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[29:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
[29:16] Speaker_A | Any other ideas or thoughts ?
[29:24] Speaker_C | Um . Ha hang on Let me catch up .
[29:27] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
[29:28] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[29:36] Speaker_C | Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ?
[29:41] Speaker_A | I think there will be time for that later . I'm guessing .
"[29:48] Speaker_A | 'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes ,"
"[29:54] Speaker_A | and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ?"
"[30:11] Speaker_A | I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay ."

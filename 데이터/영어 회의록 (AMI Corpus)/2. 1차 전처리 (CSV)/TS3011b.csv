[00:07] Speaker_A | Welcome back .
[00:08] Speaker_B | Hello .
[00:09] Speaker_D | Hello .
[00:10] Speaker_A | Uh let me see .
[00:13] Speaker_B | There's one of mine .
"[00:26] Speaker_A | Okay . Roo , welcome back ."
"[00:31] Speaker_B | Hello , Flores ."
[00:32] Speaker_A | The waiting is for Sebastian .
[00:37] Speaker_A | There he is .
[00:39] Speaker_B | We have a slight problem . I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .
[00:42] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
"[00:44] Speaker_A | Uh no . You can't , sorry ."
[00:47] Speaker_B | So just cancel it .
"[00:59] Speaker_B | Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . But it's alright ."
"[01:01] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting ."
[01:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[01:37] Speaker_C | I think so too .
[01:37] Speaker_A | Roo ?
"[01:39] Speaker_A | Ruud ? Almost , okay . Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m"
"[01:46] Speaker_B | But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe ."
[01:54] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:55] Speaker_D | Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the .
"[01:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , w we will see ."
"[01:59] Speaker_B | I don't think it's wireless here . Or it is . Yeah ? Okay , great ."
"[02:00] Speaker_A | Um it is , yeah ."
[02:00] Speaker_C | It is . It is .
[02:03] Speaker_D | Uh okay .
"[02:04] Speaker_A | Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um"
"[02:23] Speaker_A | Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product ."
[02:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[03:05] Speaker_B | Time , yeah ."
[03:41] Speaker_B | Yes .
[03:42] Speaker_A | Is that clear ?
[03:45] Speaker_A | Any questions on these
[03:48] Speaker_A | requirements ?
[03:52] Speaker_A | No ?
"[04:03] Speaker_B | Yeah , I'll start ."
"[04:03] Speaker_A | Uh uh yeah . Okay , great ."
[04:04] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[04:14] Speaker_B | Geez , and sli and show ."
[04:25] Speaker_B | Just uh press it . Uh yes .
[04:28] Speaker_B | Alright .
[04:31] Speaker_B | Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
[04:46] Speaker_B | So that was
"[04:48] Speaker_B | the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons ."
[04:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:07] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:17] Speaker_B | Um but um yeah .
"[05:21] Speaker_B | My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh"
[05:39] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[05:57] Speaker_B | take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us ."
[06:07] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:09] Speaker_A | Uh Ruud , did you get that ?"
"[06:13] Speaker_D | Yeah , uh b uh most ."
[06:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[06:17] Speaker_D | Oh , user-friendly ."
"[06:22] Speaker_A | In the market , yeah ."
[06:27] Speaker_B | Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
[06:34] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .
"[07:02] Speaker_C | Okay , it's still the right thing ."
"[07:06] Speaker_C | Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable ."
"[07:37] Speaker_A | No , it's not visible ."
"[07:39] Speaker_C | Um , there's a energy source here . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um"
"[08:23] Speaker_C | every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w yes . In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here ."
[08:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:38] Speaker_B | The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
[08:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:45] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:12] Speaker_A | So it's fairly easy .
"[09:21] Speaker_A | Okay , good ."
[09:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:32] Speaker_C | No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . So we can use them . So that's no problem ."
[10:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
[10:46] Speaker_C | We can we can make its I think .
"[10:47] Speaker_D | Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching ."
[10:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:55] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess ."
[10:56] Speaker_C | Okay .
[11:07] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[11:07] Speaker_D | Hmm , true ."
"[11:14] Speaker_C | Yes . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . No no no , no . That's right , that's right . So well , this uh should be it ."
"[11:17] Speaker_B | Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think ."
[11:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:23] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[11:27] Speaker_A | Okay , Ruud ."
"[11:27] Speaker_D | Oh , mine is already outdated ."
"[11:31] Speaker_A | Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product ."
[11:40] Speaker_A | So any income is welcome . Input .
[11:52] Speaker_D | Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .
[11:57] Speaker_D | Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .
[12:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:07] Speaker_D | But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea ."
"[12:32] Speaker_D | Well , it's this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them ."
[12:57] Speaker_C | Mm .
[13:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[13:06] Speaker_C | Or a find a finding function , you know . That's quite a yes ."
"[13:06] Speaker_A | Well , that's interesting ."
[13:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:08] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on ."
[13:11] Speaker_B | Sound signal .
[13:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:14] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[13:17] Speaker_D | Well , I just said that . And uh well , this obvious , and he also said it ."
[13:23] Speaker_A | Okay . So that's what the market tells us .
"[13:27] Speaker_D | Uh that's about it , yes ."
[13:28] Speaker_A | Yep . Okay .
"[13:33] Speaker_D | Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . But"
[13:45] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[13:47] Speaker_C | Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal ."
[13:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:50] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[14:27] Speaker_A | Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like um turning on and off the the the lights ."
[14:30] Speaker_C | Oh yes .
"[14:32] Speaker_B | Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it ."
[14:49] Speaker_A | Reports rep respend response to it .
"[14:52] Speaker_C | Yes . Yes , that's it ."
"[14:55] Speaker_C | Yes , same thing ."
[14:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:56] Speaker_A | But uh th
[14:56] Speaker_B | But but T_V_s don't have all uh
"[14:58] Speaker_C | No , so we we should use something else ."
[15:05] Speaker_C | We do not control the T_V_ set so well .
[15:19] Speaker_A | Okay . So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se
[15:23] Speaker_B | I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .
[15:31] Speaker_D | And b
"[15:34] Speaker_C | Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control ."
"[15:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , a peak . Yeah ."
[15:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:54] Speaker_D | So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep ."
"[15:57] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true ."
"[15:57] Speaker_C | Yes , so we don't want that ."
"[16:14] Speaker_C | Well , I don't think uh ."
"[16:18] Speaker_C | No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control ."
[16:24] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:46] Speaker_C | Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea ."
"[16:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise ."
[16:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[17:05] Speaker_C | I will .
[17:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:08] Speaker_C | Yes .
[17:12] Speaker_C | Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
[17:22] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:26] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[17:32] Speaker_B | And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh"
[17:40] Speaker_B | function ?
"[17:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . It's a different exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights ."
[17:47] Speaker_B | It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
[17:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:00] Speaker_B | And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . What should we choose in in design ?"
[18:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:20] Speaker_B | Well , the extra functions ."
[18:23] Speaker_D | I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
[18:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[18:28] Speaker_D | Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function ."
[18:33] Speaker_B | Used option .
"[18:43] Speaker_D | Uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important ."
"[18:46] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . Well , we skip that ."
[18:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:02] Speaker_A | No .
[19:02] Speaker_D | Nope .
[19:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:07] Speaker_A | Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .
[19:12] Speaker_A | No .
[19:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:32] Speaker_D | Uh well if we um include other uh innovative
[19:38] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[19:45] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[19:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's right ."
[19:49] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[19:51] Speaker_B | Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound ."
[20:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:15] Speaker_A | But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh"
[20:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
"[20:29] Speaker_C | Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise ."
[20:42] Speaker_A | But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? Because we do not implement uh a user history .
"[20:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . W"
[21:03] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[21:05] Speaker_C | Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that ."
"[21:20] Speaker_D | And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button ."
[21:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .
[21:27] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[21:38] Speaker_A | Yeah , draw draw it on the board ."
"[21:41] Speaker_B | Um it's already uh oh , we have a blank ."
[21:50] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[21:55] Speaker_C | Oh yeah , something like that ."
[21:58] Speaker_B | It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
[22:03] Speaker_C | Yes . Yes .
[22:07] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[22:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , it can break down ."
"[22:08] Speaker_B | when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick , I think ."
"[22:09] Speaker_C | Yes , yes ."
[22:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:13] Speaker_C | Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh"
[22:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:18] Speaker_C | more uh uh public , I think . But you're the marketing man ."
[22:18] Speaker_D | A younger uh Huh .
"[22:22] Speaker_D | And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use ."
[22:33] Speaker_B | Geez .
"[22:37] Speaker_B | Well , volume and"
[22:44] Speaker_B | something uh
"[22:49] Speaker_A | Okay , yeah ."
"[22:51] Speaker_B | And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want ."
"[22:58] Speaker_C | Okay , that's good ."
"[23:01] Speaker_A | Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness ."
[23:24] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[23:29] Speaker_B | But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that ,"
"[23:44] Speaker_A | Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um"
[23:45] Speaker_B | I think .
[23:49] Speaker_B | Yes ?
[23:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[24:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[24:00] Speaker_B | 'Kay , but teletext is so uh is just scrapped ."
[24:02] Speaker_C | Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?
"[24:10] Speaker_A | Um well , I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting ."
[24:18] Speaker_C | Okay . Okay .
[24:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:24] Speaker_B | The ten digits .
"[24:32] Speaker_B | Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah ."
[24:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yes .
[24:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:48] Speaker_A | A bit of a split mode . Uh l like Yeah . Dual channel watch . Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?"
"[24:48] Speaker_C | Change . Yes , yes ."
[24:52] Speaker_C | Yes .
[24:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:06] Speaker_D | Mielsen .
[25:23] Speaker_B | Alright .
[25:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:45] Speaker_A | Volume . Programme .
"[25:50] Speaker_C | Yes , that's important ."
[25:52] Speaker_A | And and do we want um
[25:55] Speaker_A | the ten digits ?
"[25:55] Speaker_B | The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so ."
"[25:57] Speaker_C | Well , are are you sure ? I'm not so sure ."
"[25:58] Speaker_D | Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button ."
[26:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:02] Speaker_C | Well , that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that ."
[26:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:08] Speaker_B | I wouldn't buy it personally .
[26:11] Speaker_C | If it were so .
"[26:13] Speaker_C | Okay , I can imagine when"
"[26:17] Speaker_C | I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough ."
[26:34] Speaker_A | But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
[26:35] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[26:37] Speaker_C | Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ?"
[26:37] Speaker_B | The older people only use five of them .
[26:41] Speaker_A | Often .
"[26:46] Speaker_C | No , you're probably right ."
[26:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:49] Speaker_C | Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?
"[26:56] Speaker_C | The design . Okay . Well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it ."
[26:56] Speaker_B | On the design .
[27:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:15] Speaker_C | Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Okay ."
"[27:21] Speaker_A | Exactly , exactly ."
"[27:22] Speaker_D | And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh"
"[27:36] Speaker_A | Okay , speech ."
"[27:37] Speaker_C | Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control ."
[27:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[27:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:53] Speaker_A | To find yeah .
[28:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:07] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[28:09] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[28:12] Speaker_C | Okay , okay ."
[28:14] Speaker_D | Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but
[28:20] Speaker_A | Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .
[28:24] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[28:24] Speaker_C | Okay . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that ."
[28:29] Speaker_B | So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
[28:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[28:34] Speaker_C | Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function ."
[28:46] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:49] Speaker_C | So that's that's a big advantage , I think ."
[28:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[28:51] Speaker_A | Okay , g good ."
[29:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[29:09] Speaker_C | There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . You have to do nothing for it ."
[29:26] Speaker_A | Mm .
[29:29] Speaker_A | Yep .
[29:41] Speaker_A | But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?
"[29:47] Speaker_D | And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge ,"
"[29:57] Speaker_C | No , that's very cheap ."
[29:59] Speaker_A | Is a cradle very cheap ?
"[29:59] Speaker_C | It's Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts ."
"[30:06] Speaker_A | I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well ."
"[30:08] Speaker_C | Yes , but they're they're mass production . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing ."
[30:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[30:14] Speaker_A | Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um
[30:41] Speaker_D | Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
[30:54] Speaker_D | want to sell to .
[31:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
[31:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[31:11] Speaker_D | I don't think that's a big problem
[31:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:19] Speaker_D | Yes . Yeah , profitable ."
[31:20] Speaker_C | Profitable .
"[31:21] Speaker_A | Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Okay . O okay ."
[31:26] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[31:33] Speaker_B | I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think ."
[31:35] Speaker_A | Nothing to add .
[31:39] Speaker_A | Sebastian ?
[31:39] Speaker_C | Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um
[31:43] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[31:45] Speaker_A | Great .
"[31:49] Speaker_C | so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things ."
[32:12] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[32:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[32:14] Speaker_C | Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons ."
[32:42] Speaker_A | Yep .
[33:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:09] Speaker_B | But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? The circuit board .
[33:13] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . The circuit board .
[33:13] Speaker_A | The board .
[33:16] Speaker_B | The fewer buttons you can use on it .
"[33:18] Speaker_C | The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes ."
"[33:18] Speaker_A | No , it's th yeah ."
"[33:20] Speaker_B | Yeah , okay ."
"[33:21] Speaker_A | It's the other way around , yeah ."
[33:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[33:23] Speaker_C | And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's"
[33:30] Speaker_C | that's another advantage .
[33:30] Speaker_A | It shouldn't be a big issue .
[33:31] Speaker_B | Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .
[33:40] Speaker_B | No .
[33:41] Speaker_C | It can be costly . Maybe not .
[33:49] Speaker_C | Yes .
[33:55] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[33:58] Speaker_A | Okay , great . Um"
"[34:02] Speaker_B | We're done , I think ."
[34:07] Speaker_C | How nice .
[34:13] Speaker_B | Me neither .
[34:45] Speaker_B | Interface industrial .
"[34:50] Speaker_A | I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . And um"
"[35:07] Speaker_A | Well , i it should be easy , that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um"
[35:10] Speaker_C | Mm yes .
[35:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:25] Speaker_C | So we drop the voice recognition ? Or Oh .
[35:35] Speaker_C | Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?
[35:41] Speaker_A | No .
[35:42] Speaker_A | We can decide the next meeting . Yep .
[35:44] Speaker_C | Okay .
[35:50] Speaker_B | Yep .
[35:56] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[36:03] Speaker_B | Adapt .
[36:03] Speaker_C | Adapt .
[36:03] Speaker_D | Left .
[36:04] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[36:09] Speaker_B | That's it .
[36:11] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[36:11] Speaker_A | Any other questions or can we have the lunch ?
[36:14] Speaker_C | We can have the lunch .
[36:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[36:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay . Good ."
[36:16] Speaker_B | I'll take the lunch .

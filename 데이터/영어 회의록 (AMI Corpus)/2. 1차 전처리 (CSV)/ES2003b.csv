[00:04] Speaker_C | Just put it on the deskt desktop .
[00:07] Speaker_B | No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link .
[00:15] Speaker_B | A well actually just there . Yeah . That's it . If you dump it in there .
"[00:16] Speaker_C | Project documents , yeah ."
[00:19] Speaker_C | What's your username ?
[00:21] Speaker_B | Your username .
[00:22] Speaker_C | What's your username and password ?
[00:29] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[00:34] Speaker_C | Sorry .
[00:39] Speaker_C | Okay .
[00:39] Speaker_B | Okay . Excellent . Right . Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . So . Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um
[00:41] Speaker_C | There we go .
"[00:56] Speaker_B | we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um"
"[01:32] Speaker_B | due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want ."
[02:01] Speaker_A | Mm .
[02:24] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
[02:31] Speaker_C | Sure .
"[02:34] Speaker_C | Um , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here ."
"[02:46] Speaker_C | Um , try second one maybe ."
"[02:54] Speaker_C | Try it , yeah maybe ."
"[02:56] Speaker_B | Oh sorry . Okay , right ."
"[02:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay . Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but ."
[03:00] Speaker_B | Uh if you that's all right . If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?
[03:07] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
[03:12] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[03:14] Speaker_C | Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . Okay ."
[03:47] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[04:26] Speaker_C | Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . Finally , my opinion ."
[05:16] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[05:18] Speaker_C | The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it ."
"[06:27] Speaker_C | in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine ."
"[07:18] Speaker_B | Okay , yep ."
"[07:19] Speaker_C | So we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people"
"[07:45] Speaker_C | will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider . I think it's cool ,"
[08:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[08:30] Speaker_B | If you could uh
"[08:32] Speaker_B | sor if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . Sorry . Cool ."
[08:35] Speaker_C | I'm sorry ?
"[08:37] Speaker_C | Sure . I'm about to end , yeah . I think it's cool"
[08:40] Speaker_C | but there are definitely some considerations .
"[08:43] Speaker_C | So , yeah ."
[08:43] Speaker_B | Okay . Excellent . Right . Um .
"[08:49] Speaker_B | Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . Um , you've got your presentation now , is it on the is it ? Okay ."
[08:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:57] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's in the it's in the folder yeah ."
"[09:01] Speaker_C | There was uh a website , uh ,"
[09:02] Speaker_D | Oh .
[09:04] Speaker_C | right here .
"[09:05] Speaker_D | Ah , okay ."
[09:07] Speaker_A | Mm .
[09:16] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[09:17] Speaker_A | Okay , this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so"
[09:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
[09:36] Speaker_A | press on . I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um
[09:49] Speaker_A | and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on .
"[10:51] Speaker_A | With uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh"
"[11:30] Speaker_A | My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . So , something that's uh"
"[12:10] Speaker_A | Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh"
"[12:40] Speaker_A | of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . And so it's taking taking the lead from that ."
[12:50] Speaker_C | Mm .
[13:12] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[13:12] Speaker_A | Um .
"[13:14] Speaker_B | Right . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer ."
[13:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:21] Speaker_D | Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . Um , alright ."
[13:27] Speaker_D | Click to save in where do I have to save it ?
"[13:29] Speaker_B | If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here ."
"[13:43] Speaker_D | Um , what I've done with it , I'm sorry ."
[13:56] Speaker_D | Shit .
[14:15] Speaker_B | Are you finding it okay or ?
[14:17] Speaker_D | I'm just closing it now . where I've saved it .
"[14:21] Speaker_C | Well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working yeah , and you just click file save as ."
[14:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[14:46] Speaker_D | Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the"
"[14:54] Speaker_D | the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh"
[15:44] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[15:55] Speaker_D | That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . So , that'll be decided , I guess ."
[16:06] Speaker_B | Okay .
[16:18] Speaker_B | Oh . Yeah .
"[16:27] Speaker_D | Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything ."
"[16:34] Speaker_D | You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on ."
"[16:46] Speaker_D | Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that ."
"[16:58] Speaker_B | Okay . Well . Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . Are you is it yeah ? Okay . Right . Um , right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um"
"[17:01] Speaker_D | No , it's finished , yeah ."
"[17:18] Speaker_B | along with the new user requirements ,"
[17:24] Speaker_B | um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um
"[17:31] Speaker_B | I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . Um that's just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small"
[17:42] Speaker_D | Cost . Mm .
[17:59] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:20] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[18:33] Speaker_B | T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ?"
[18:42] Speaker_C | Mm .
[18:58] Speaker_A | Mm .
[19:12] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:20] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[19:32] Speaker_D | Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ?"
"[19:43] Speaker_A | Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um ."
[19:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:53] Speaker_C | Mm .
[19:54] Speaker_A | And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind . Um though
[20:01] Speaker_A | I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down .
"[20:18] Speaker_A | Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . It does nothing extra ."
"[20:30] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . Um now I mean I don't sorry , go for it ."
"[20:39] Speaker_C | Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ?"
"[21:16] Speaker_C | Most people , yeah ."
[21:17] Speaker_A | Mm .
[21:27] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[21:31] Speaker_C | Sure . I think that's fair yeah .
[21:32] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[21:33] Speaker_B | Um , I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit . I dunno ."
[21:54] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[22:12] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[22:22] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[22:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[22:32] Speaker_A | Mm . I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put"
[22:49] Speaker_A | um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um .
[22:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:00] Speaker_A | But uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh
[23:25] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:31] Speaker_A | integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um
"[23:47] Speaker_A | of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . I just think that uh possibly mm ."
[23:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Mm-hmm .
[24:03] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[24:21] Speaker_A | Mm .
[24:28] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[24:49] Speaker_B | I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that ."
[25:02] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[25:03] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[25:05] Speaker_C | Okay , specifically television ."
[25:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
[25:09] Speaker_C | So the joystick is just for differentness .
[25:14] Speaker_A | Mm .
[25:17] Speaker_C | Okay .
[25:18] Speaker_A | Just a thought .
[25:27] Speaker_A | Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with
"[25:31] Speaker_B | There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting ."
[25:42] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[25:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:02] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:09] Speaker_C | Is this gonna be enough to to sell ?
"[26:12] Speaker_B | Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is ."
[26:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[26:30] Speaker_A | Mm , yeah , I've seen them ."
"[26:30] Speaker_C | I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally ."
[26:32] Speaker_B | Um .
"[26:45] Speaker_B | Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . And that could be something could um separate us a bit . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into . Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well ."
[26:56] Speaker_A | Mm .
[27:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[27:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think that's a good idea ."
"[27:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's a good idea ."
[27:41] Speaker_B | So .
"[27:43] Speaker_B | To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique ."
"[27:58] Speaker_B | Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ ."
[27:58] Speaker_A | Mm .
[28:15] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
"[28:17] Speaker_D | We're just saying volume . Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?"
[28:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:26] Speaker_A | For volume .
[28:27] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[28:27] Speaker_C | But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . Um , power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , and volume selection ."
[28:33] Speaker_B | Okay .
[28:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[28:53] Speaker_C | No , yeah , okay okay ."
"[28:56] Speaker_B | So we well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?"
"[29:16] Speaker_B | So we're having very very few buttons involved , but navigation around a menu for most things ."
"[29:23] Speaker_A | Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay ."
[29:33] Speaker_B | Okay .
[29:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
[29:46] Speaker_A | Or vice versa . And that's really irritating .
[29:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[30:08] Speaker_B | Okay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?
"[30:22] Speaker_D | Yeah , think so ."
"[30:29] Speaker_B | The ability to locate it again . So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . Sorry ?"
[30:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:47] Speaker_D | Light bulb as well , no ?"
[30:48] Speaker_A | Oh . So so a small speaker you mean .
"[30:50] Speaker_B | Some speaker , sorry , yeah ."
[30:50] Speaker_C | Speaker yeah .
[30:52] Speaker_D | And a light bulb ? No . To flash . No .
"[30:56] Speaker_D | Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it ."
[31:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:04] Speaker_B | th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now ."
[31:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[31:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Blue ones particularly . Plus that's a nice wee design touch .
[31:13] Speaker_B | Um .
[31:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[31:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[31:31] Speaker_B | you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such ."
[31:39] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[32:11] Speaker_B | If , yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into ."
[32:20] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:27] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[32:29] Speaker_C | Sure . Sure .
[32:31] Speaker_B | Okay . Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? Anything that they think has been missed out . Bit of a wide open question there of course .
[32:43] Speaker_C | Mm .
[32:46] Speaker_B | Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .
[32:52] Speaker_C | Sure .
[32:54] Speaker_B | Right .
[32:54] Speaker_C | 'Kay . Yeah .
"[33:00] Speaker_B | Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um ,"
"[33:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , and a transmitter ."
[33:03] Speaker_C | Transmitter .
"[33:06] Speaker_A | Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television ."
"[33:24] Speaker_B | Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . Uses maybe gives us a new potential market ."
[33:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:35] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:44] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .

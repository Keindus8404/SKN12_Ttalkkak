[03:57] Speaker_A | Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So uh . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
[04:12] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:29] Speaker_A | Mm .
[05:09] Speaker_A | So I will ask you all to do the same . Just to get used to the whiteboard .
[05:12] Speaker_B | Okay .

[05:54] Speaker_B | So I tried to sketch it out .
"[05:58] Speaker_B | I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah ."
[06:10] Speaker_B | Can you recognise it as a bird ?
"[06:16] Speaker_D | Okay , okay ."
[06:41] Speaker_A | Oh .

"[07:46] Speaker_B | Are you left-handed ? Oh , pity ."
[07:48] Speaker_C | No .
"[08:00] Speaker_C | Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can ."
"[08:17] Speaker_B | Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it ."
[08:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:25] Speaker_D | No .
[08:59] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[09:01] Speaker_B | You won't draw them , or ?"
[09:05] Speaker_B | Just try . I would like to see how it looks like .
"[09:27] Speaker_B | No , I think it's clear ."
[09:35] Speaker_C | Okay .
[09:37] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:44] Speaker_C | Mm .
[09:47] Speaker_C | Yeah . I'm shameful Yeah . Okay .
[09:49] Speaker_B | It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful .
[09:50] Speaker_A | Good .
[09:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[10:04] Speaker_B | Bob . Have to remember it .
[10:07] Speaker_B | Bob .
"[10:08] Speaker_A | So good um So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro ."
[10:35] Speaker_A | And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
"[10:42] Speaker_A | So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world ."
[10:47] Speaker_A | Uh .
"[10:49] Speaker_A | So , um ."
[10:52] Speaker_A | The We expect a production cost of maximum
[10:58] Speaker_A | uh twelve point fifty Euro .
"[11:03] Speaker_B | Per unit , I guess . Y oh okay ."
"[11:11] Speaker_A | Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything ."
[11:36] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[11:37] Speaker_D | Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um ."
[12:05] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:06] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[12:10] Speaker_D | So it's frustrated me in the past , th that ."
"[12:14] Speaker_B | Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this ."
[12:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:49] Speaker_B | And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like ."
[12:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:03] Speaker_D | Ah , okay . Okay ."
[13:07] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:07] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[13:11] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[13:12] Speaker_D | Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that"
[13:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:17] Speaker_B | Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume ."
[13:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:28] Speaker_B | Ah , n ."
[13:31] Speaker_B | If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
"[13:33] Speaker_A | Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and"
[13:43] Speaker_A | you have a heart attack .
[13:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[13:53] Speaker_B | Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that ."
[13:58] Speaker_A | Yeah so you can Do you have something ?
"[13:58] Speaker_C | Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune ."
"[14:11] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true ."
[14:16] Speaker_A | Yeah without obstacles and .
[14:19] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[14:26] Speaker_A | Okay . Let's continue . I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . Um . So we will close uh this meeting . So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes ."

"[16:07] Speaker_A | Don't choose for youself . That's selfish . Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff ."
[16:10] Speaker_D | It's pretty abstract .
"[16:51] Speaker_B | Yeah , how much is it ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ?"
[16:52] Speaker_D | Like how much ?
"[16:54] Speaker_A | Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh"
[16:57] Speaker_C | Twenty million .
[16:57] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
"[17:00] Speaker_C | Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah ."
[17:10] Speaker_A | we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television .
[17:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:22] Speaker_A | So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others ."
[17:42] Speaker_A | Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table .
[18:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:17] Speaker_D | I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?

[18:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:46] Speaker_D | Screen ? Okay .

[19:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:33] Speaker_A | Okay . Five minutes . Yeah .
"[19:35] Speaker_D | Five minutes ? Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products ."
[19:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:57] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[19:57] Speaker_D | Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth ."
[20:14] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay .
[20:21] Speaker_D | And something like an L_C_D_ screen .
[20:24] Speaker_B | For what purpose ?
[20:40] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:42] Speaker_A | So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh
"[20:49] Speaker_D | From my point of view , yeah ."
"[20:49] Speaker_A | remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?"
"[20:58] Speaker_D | Yeah , our company is very uh"
[21:03] Speaker_D | good in making new innovative uh things .
[21:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:08] Speaker_D | So i i i i
[21:15] Speaker_D | To the current market .
[21:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .

"[01:34] Speaker_A | Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting ."
"[01:35] Speaker_B | Uh , okay ."
[01:36] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[01:40] Speaker_A | The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? Okay ."
[02:21] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[02:22] Speaker_A | Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . So But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard ."
[02:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:43] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[02:50] Speaker_B | Uh , may be better , yeah ."
[02:51] Speaker_D | Keyboard work . Yeah .
[02:52] Speaker_A | I think it will
[02:54] Speaker_A | will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes .
[02:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:57] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[02:59] Speaker_C | Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of ."
"[03:12] Speaker_C | Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls ."
"[03:34] Speaker_C | Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand ."
"[03:57] Speaker_C | Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction ."
[04:28] Speaker_C | It's okay . Yeah .
[04:53] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[04:56] Speaker_C | the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um ,"
"[05:14] Speaker_C | Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh"
"[05:21] Speaker_C | energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls ."
"[05:45] Speaker_C | uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium"
[05:56] Speaker_C | would also be a bit weird .
[05:59] Speaker_B | Oh titanium is
"[06:02] Speaker_B | probably trendy , I think ."
"[06:05] Speaker_D | That's true , I guess . Yeah ."
"[06:08] Speaker_B | Well , maybe a little bit expensive ."
[06:12] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[06:12] Speaker_D | Huh .
"[06:13] Speaker_C | Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium ."
"[06:22] Speaker_C | the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the"
[06:37] Speaker_C | components are uh just available in uh
[06:41] Speaker_C | in our uh factory .
"[06:46] Speaker_C | Mm ,"
"[06:50] Speaker_C | I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company ."
"[07:14] Speaker_C | Um , another possibility . I uh"
"[07:17] Speaker_C | yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh"
"[07:25] Speaker_C | something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros ."
[07:37] Speaker_A | Twelve and a half .
[07:38] Speaker_C | Ah yeah .
[07:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[07:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , production cost ."
"[07:56] Speaker_A | What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so"
"[08:01] Speaker_A | But it's actually kind of uh well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design ."
[08:05] Speaker_C | Yes .
[08:06] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[08:11] Speaker_C | Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh"
[08:14] Speaker_A | And we can we can steal their ideas .
[08:24] Speaker_C | a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh
[08:29] Speaker_A | Huh .
[08:33] Speaker_C | with a huge variety of uh
"[08:37] Speaker_A | Well , it's a possibility , too ."
[08:38] Speaker_B | Different colours also .
[08:42] Speaker_A | Uh-uh .
[08:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:48] Speaker_C | Yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it ."
"[08:53] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
[08:55] Speaker_D | Yeah . Definitely .
[09:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:00] Speaker_D | Alright .
[09:06] Speaker_B | Ah .
"[09:20] Speaker_B | Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um"
"[09:35] Speaker_A | Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting ."
[09:39] Speaker_A | Didn't we ?
"[09:45] Speaker_A | Oh , okay . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only ."
[09:49] Speaker_B | nothing .
"[09:53] Speaker_B | Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of ."
[09:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:09] Speaker_B | Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um"
[10:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[10:18] Speaker_B | Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit"
[10:45] Speaker_B | too much for twelve and a half .
[10:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:48] Speaker_B | Production . If we got already uh something like a base .
[10:49] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[10:55] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
"[10:57] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , it's okay ."
"[11:10] Speaker_B | A little bit too big , I think ."
[11:13] Speaker_B | Exactly .
[11:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[11:15] Speaker_B | Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of uh , so that's very easy ."
[11:20] Speaker_A | No . No .
[11:21] Speaker_D | No .
[11:29] Speaker_A | But you do mention the next and previous uh button .
"[11:34] Speaker_D | Next channel , previous channel ."
"[11:35] Speaker_A | Oh , okay , o okay okay ."
"[11:40] Speaker_B | Um oh , I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . So , it's uh just an idea ."
[11:43] Speaker_A | Huh .
[12:04] Speaker_D | I think it depends on the function .
"[12:06] Speaker_B | Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness ."
[12:12] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[12:12] Speaker_D | Well , if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course ."
"[12:31] Speaker_B | Yeah , I've nothing to s"
"[12:33] Speaker_D | Oh , that's right ."
"[12:33] Speaker_A | Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger ."
[12:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , that groups . Large ?"
[12:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:57] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[12:59] Speaker_A | I think yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , because that's the mo it it you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ?"
[13:02] Speaker_B | Most the most used uh buttons .
[13:02] Speaker_D | Those are probably the the th
"[13:11] Speaker_A | It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t"
[13:15] Speaker_D | Yes .
[13:16] Speaker_B | True . Yeah .
[13:20] Speaker_D | Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .
[13:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:26] Speaker_C | You did the research .
"[13:26] Speaker_A | And you want to acc accentuate that , you know ."
[13:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:28] Speaker_D | Sorry ?
"[13:34] Speaker_B | Okay . Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left . So Yeah , ."
[13:40] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[13:42] Speaker_A | No uh , that's coo it's cool ."
[13:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:54] Speaker_D | Oh .
[13:56] Speaker_D | Go away .
[14:06] Speaker_D | Come on .
[14:06] Speaker_B | It's there .
"[14:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , click on it ."
[14:12] Speaker_B | Couple time .
"[14:13] Speaker_D | Oh , great ."
"[14:16] Speaker_D | Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet ."
"[14:22] Speaker_D | Um I've done some investigation , and uh well"
[14:29] Speaker_D | I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan .
[16:03] Speaker_A | It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours .
[16:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say ?"
"[16:43] Speaker_D | Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes ."
"[17:02] Speaker_B | But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? Uh , make it a banana ?"
"[17:09] Speaker_A | No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . It's like a pear or something ."
"[17:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , there's there's always a"
"[17:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something ."
"[17:35] Speaker_D | No , of course not ."
[17:41] Speaker_D | Especially i
"[17:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly ."
[17:48] Speaker_D | If we make it little bit greenish .
[17:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:50] Speaker_A | You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round 'Kay ."
[17:53] Speaker_D | A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ?
[17:59] Speaker_C | Grapes .
[18:02] Speaker_D | Wha whatever .
[18:02] Speaker_B | But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ?
"[18:08] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure ."
[18:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:10] Speaker_A | we have a very big uh the s
"[18:11] Speaker_D | Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah ."
"[18:14] Speaker_A | Of d design team , yeah ."
[18:24] Speaker_C | But uh but I think we don't have to make
[18:30] Speaker_C | we can't make all uh ten designs . We have to make one design I th I I think .
[18:30] Speaker_A | No .
"[18:36] Speaker_A | No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . Uh , it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . And it's it looks fruity to me ."
[18:37] Speaker_D | Mayb maybe two or three .
[18:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:51] Speaker_A | And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too ."
[19:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[19:03] Speaker_A | Maybe it's too much , you know ."
"[19:03] Speaker_B | But , we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yellow , a Real Reaction ."
"[19:10] Speaker_A | Okay , but what are the This is yellow ."
[19:11] Speaker_D | Well we c yeah .
"[19:13] Speaker_C | Yes , you can put a logo on top of it ."
[19:16] Speaker_A | But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .
"[19:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , sure ."
"[19:17] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah ."
[19:26] Speaker_B | A yellow do
"[19:28] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah ."
"[19:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , and the button then ."
[19:34] Speaker_C | With a strawberry on top .
"[19:35] Speaker_D | Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know ."
"[19:38] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
"[19:40] Speaker_D | On the front , of course , because else you can't find it ."
[19:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[19:45] Speaker_D | Well , that were my ideas a little bit ."
"[19:48] Speaker_D | I'll close 'em down . Um , go away ."
[19:48] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[19:54] Speaker_A | Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?"
"[19:56] Speaker_D | Conceptual design , yes ."
[19:59] Speaker_A | See what was on the agenda .
[20:03] Speaker_D | The agenda .
"[20:04] Speaker_A | This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , but I don't think it's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?"
[20:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:21] Speaker_C | Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on ."
"[20:30] Speaker_C | No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button ."
[20:30] Speaker_A | I don't think we should do it .
"[20:49] Speaker_C | No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ?"
"[20:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , I don't know ."
[21:03] Speaker_B | Well well what would you display on it then ?
"[21:05] Speaker_C | Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide"
"[21:08] Speaker_B | But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ?"
"[21:17] Speaker_A | But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control ."
[21:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:20] Speaker_C | Yes , but you also want to know what's next ."
"[21:22] Speaker_D | But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , but whatever . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible ."
"[21:26] Speaker_B | Yeah , and we also have to yeah ."
"[21:35] Speaker_D | Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control ."
"[21:48] Speaker_A | I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know ."
[22:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:15] Speaker_D | That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile ."
"[22:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after ."
[22:26] Speaker_D | No . No . I don't think so ei either .
[22:34] Speaker_C | No .
"[22:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , I dunno ."
[22:42] Speaker_A | And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights .
[22:50] Speaker_B | We can you away .
"[23:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , I guess ."
"[23:15] Speaker_B | But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?"
"[23:18] Speaker_C | Uh , then you push a button ."
[23:25] Speaker_B | About that programme ?
"[23:32] Speaker_A | Nah , that's not gonna work ."
[23:33] Speaker_D | No .
"[23:33] Speaker_C | But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first"
[23:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[23:39] Speaker_A | Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's that that's what I've seen ."
[23:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , if you uh Yeah ."
"[23:52] Speaker_C | Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . But uh I haven't thought about it ."
[23:57] Speaker_A | But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept .
[24:01] Speaker_C | But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh
[24:13] Speaker_B | Is it fashion ?
[24:14] Speaker_A | I don't think so .
"[24:26] Speaker_A | Yeah , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ?"
"[24:29] Speaker_D | Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think Uh , I think it will be too expensive ."
[24:53] Speaker_C | But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . So why don't we use it .
[25:02] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah yeah .
"[25:05] Speaker_D | Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ?"
"[25:16] Speaker_D | Yeah really , if y if you c i"
"[25:20] Speaker_A | Then uh then you better don't yeah , d"
"[25:27] Speaker_C | No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , mm ,"
[25:54] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:02] Speaker_B | With one thing special . Not a whole package of specialty .
"[26:07] Speaker_A | I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ ."
"[26:15] Speaker_C | No , when y"
[26:27] Speaker_A | It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote .
[26:38] Speaker_D | We have a pear .
"[26:50] Speaker_C | Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station ."
"[26:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station ."
[26:52] Speaker_B | True .
[26:54] Speaker_D | Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ?
"[26:55] Speaker_C | Yes , he have a picture of it ."
"[26:58] Speaker_B | Yeah , I dunno ."
"[27:00] Speaker_D | Exactly , I've never seen it in a store ."
"[27:01] Speaker_A | Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d"
"[27:17] Speaker_B | No , it's too much ."
"[27:19] Speaker_D | I think it's a little too much , yeah ."
[27:21] Speaker_B | It's overdone .
"[27:22] Speaker_A | Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something ."
[27:23] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[27:49] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . You can st throw it at your little brother's head ."
"[27:50] Speaker_D | Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . Yeah ."
[27:52] Speaker_C | Yes .
[27:52] Speaker_B | With a spongy Bob feel .
[27:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:01] Speaker_C | Like a b yes .
"[28:02] Speaker_B | Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah ."
"[28:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . No no no , not that comfy ."
[28:08] Speaker_C | Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see .
[28:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:28] Speaker_B | But not black I think .
"[28:30] Speaker_A | it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point ."
[28:30] Speaker_D | No .
"[28:33] Speaker_B | Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful ."
"[28:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at ."
[28:44] Speaker_B | Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ?
[28:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , maybe so ."
[28:49] Speaker_B | Make it a bee ?
"[28:59] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's our yeah . We we have to use yellow ."
[29:05] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[29:06] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[29:07] Speaker_A | I don't like yellow , and uh maybe I don't know ."
"[29:09] Speaker_D | Well , we can as as I"
[29:10] Speaker_C | But that's not really fruity .
"[29:11] Speaker_D | draw really nicely over there . We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But , i"
"[29:24] Speaker_A | Okay , but what uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ?"
[29:28] Speaker_C | Uh fronts
[29:32] Speaker_C | We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the
"[29:37] Speaker_A | Should we do that ? I don't think you we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , I guess ."
[29:37] Speaker_C | telephone .
[29:40] Speaker_B | Different fronts .
[29:42] Speaker_D | Yeah . I guess that's that's enough .
[29:48] Speaker_D | That's way too Nokia .
[29:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:51] Speaker_B | Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that ."
[29:52] Speaker_C | Are these designs ?
"[29:55] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[29:55] Speaker_D | Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market ."
"[30:00] Speaker_D | Why not , yeah ."
"[30:00] Speaker_A | But uh , without gon uh okay . So , are we through the technical part then ?"
[30:04] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[30:05] Speaker_A | Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but Yeah ."
[30:09] Speaker_C | It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles .
"[30:13] Speaker_A | The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . O o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question , I guess ."
[30:23] Speaker_C | But also w
"[30:23] Speaker_B | It's just like that , th this titanium ."
"[30:26] Speaker_C | Yes , b bu but when we use s soft"
"[30:27] Speaker_A | But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? Makes it in a homogeneous uh design ."
[30:33] Speaker_D | Sure .
[30:34] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[30:35] Speaker_B | No , not all , not all of them ."
[30:37] Speaker_C | But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
"[30:45] Speaker_C | when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . No uh ,"
"[30:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true ."
"[30:53] Speaker_A | No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah ."
"[30:57] Speaker_A | Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ?"
"[31:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think it I think it does ."
"[31:06] Speaker_B | Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic ."
[31:11] Speaker_B | In trendy things .
"[31:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , o"
[31:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , that's true ."
[31:34] Speaker_C | Sports and gaming . Define .
"[31:35] Speaker_A | When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around ."
"[31:46] Speaker_B | You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ?"
[31:47] Speaker_D | Yes . Yeah .
"[31:54] Speaker_C | Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic ."
"[31:57] Speaker_B | Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking ."
[32:00] Speaker_D | What ?
"[32:01] Speaker_B | Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very"
"[32:06] Speaker_D | Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah ."
"[32:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , I see ."
[32:12] Speaker_B | rough .
"[32:22] Speaker_C | No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic ."
"[32:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these ."
"[32:34] Speaker_A | No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . You know , like the the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible ."
[32:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[32:48] Speaker_A | But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . But make it just like shiny . Maybe we should uh shou
[32:51] Speaker_C | Yes .
[32:52] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[32:54] Speaker_C | Like the M_P_ three player .
[33:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:01] Speaker_A | And uh and
"[33:04] Speaker_A | maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh , how how much time have we got left ?"
"[33:07] Speaker_C | Uh , in a lot of other uh"
[33:09] Speaker_A | Forty minutes .
[33:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[33:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[33:41] Speaker_C | Yes , and and styles . They have uh also uh a kind of uh um"
[33:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[33:51] Speaker_D | Uh yeah , yeah ."
"[33:52] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas"
"[33:58] Speaker_C | Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes ."
[34:04] Speaker_D | Yes .
[34:06] Speaker_D | New prints on it . Yep .
"[34:07] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ?"
[34:37] Speaker_B | The rubber .
"[34:38] Speaker_A | How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T"
[34:43] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[34:45] Speaker_C | There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th"
"[34:46] Speaker_B | Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think ."
[34:50] Speaker_D | How the buttons yeah .
"[34:52] Speaker_A | I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour ."
[34:57] Speaker_C | Yes .
[35:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[35:07] Speaker_A | Okay , but not more than Well , yeah , it's No . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting ."
[35:08] Speaker_B | In in another colour . Not more than two colours I think . It's a g a little bit too flashy .
"[35:11] Speaker_D | No , definitely not ."
"[35:13] Speaker_D | Yes , definitely ."
"[35:19] Speaker_A | Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . Uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons ."
"[35:24] Speaker_B | The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea ."
[35:28] Speaker_A | No .
"[35:29] Speaker_D | No , I think that's too vulnerable ."
[35:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[35:31] Speaker_A | I think this is okay , the so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button ."
[35:39] Speaker_A | And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu .
"[35:43] Speaker_D | Yeah , but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television ."
"[35:47] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b"
"[35:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? Is uh isn't that different from every television ?"
[36:03] Speaker_A | But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then .
[36:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[36:10] Speaker_D | Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever ."
"[36:13] Speaker_A | And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . It's all we need . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess ."
[36:14] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[36:16] Speaker_D | Mm , yeah ."
[36:22] Speaker_D | A mute and a teletext and a menu .
[36:24] Speaker_B | Mute .
[36:26] Speaker_D | That's all .
[36:28] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[36:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[36:29] Speaker_D | Great . Yeah .
"[36:41] Speaker_D | Yeah , definitely . Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ?"
"[36:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , that's true ."
"[37:00] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w"
"[37:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , definitely ."
[37:26] Speaker_A | to get to that .

[37:38] Speaker_D | Yes .
[37:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[37:44] Speaker_A | But our des design experts will uh work that out . Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . So we will wrap up ."
[37:45] Speaker_D | Yea yeah .
[37:48] Speaker_D | Yep .
[37:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .

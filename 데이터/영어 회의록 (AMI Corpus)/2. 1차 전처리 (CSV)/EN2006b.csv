"[00:05] Speaker_A | Great , thank you . Yep ."
[00:06] Speaker_D | Cheers .
[00:10] Speaker_C | Right .
[00:12] Speaker_B | Helium one . I think there should be a break for and . But I think maybe that one should be underlined .
[00:12] Speaker_C | Mm mm hmm .
"[00:14] Speaker_A | Sorry , mm yep ."
[00:15] Speaker_D | It should be this one here .
"[00:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's hard to know what that is . That's this is a bit of H_T_M_L_ goo ."
[00:27] Speaker_C | I think there should be a break for and .
[00:27] Speaker_B | Helium .
[00:33] Speaker_B | M_B_D_A_ presumably is lambda .
"[00:34] Speaker_C | But this this isn't a s yeah . And this isn't a separate thing , so I w I would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and . Right ?"
"[00:39] Speaker_A | Uh yes , course , of course it is , yeah ."
[00:43] Speaker_B | And the in that case . Yep .
"[00:46] Speaker_D | Do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah , okay ."
[00:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[00:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[00:51] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[00:58] Speaker_B | Right , what's different ? Just this . High excitation emission lines ."
[00:59] Speaker_C | Mm mm-hmm .
[01:06] Speaker_C | Mm .
[01:12] Speaker_B | It's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from .
"[01:17] Speaker_C | Yes . Yeah , yeah ."
[01:23] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[01:33] Speaker_B | ESO , I don't think is an instrument ."
[01:37] Speaker_C | ESO isn't an instrument . You're right .
[01:39] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:48] Speaker_C | We agreed for to keep hubble . Yep .
"[01:51] Speaker_B | To not yes , to keep hubble . Um for this that should be green as well ."
"[01:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , that should be a source type , yeah ."
"[02:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , do you think that's part of the name , yeah . I don't yeah , I have no way of knowing , yeah ."
"[02:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think it all is yeah , I think it is all m one name . Yep ."
[02:08] Speaker_B | Absorption line systems shouldn't be there . Absorption line systems .
[02:10] Speaker_C | Yep .
[02:15] Speaker_B | And again .
[02:16] Speaker_C | Yep .
[02:22] Speaker_C | Right .
"[02:27] Speaker_B | Needs column densities , which is a derived property ."
[02:34] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[02:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , these are s s species ions again , not individual lines ."
"[02:38] Speaker_C | Yep , that's fine ."
[02:39] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:44] Speaker_B | And Lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either .
[02:46] Speaker_C | Nope .
[02:54] Speaker_B | No . For some reason I seem to have just died on this one . He got bored .
[03:06] Speaker_B | You're right there .
[03:07] Speaker_C | Okay .
[03:17] Speaker_B | I've labelled that wrong .
[03:21] Speaker_B | And here again .
"[03:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , and this one ."
"[03:28] Speaker_C | Mm that's a spectral feature , that's okay ."
[03:29] Speaker_B | Um it is . But is emission line A_G_N_ a separate class from A_G_N_ ?
[03:41] Speaker_C | Emission line A_G_N_ . You can get A_G_N_ without emission lines .
[03:46] Speaker_B | But I don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source . A separate source class .
"[03:52] Speaker_C | I think in Phil's paper he does , doesn't he ? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week ."
[03:53] Speaker_B | Maybe you would .
"[04:00] Speaker_B | Mm , I didn't it , I just looked at the plu"
"[04:01] Speaker_C | I didn't know what he meant , but yes . I've seen people talk about them as separate classes , but I don't really know what that means ."
[04:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[04:19] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[04:26] Speaker_B | No . Oh , galactic stars ."
[04:31] Speaker_B | I think you're r you're right again there .
[04:34] Speaker_C | Mm 'kay .
[04:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[04:43] Speaker_A | Well it's one of them out um over here I think actually at the moment . So 'cause our sun is a is a T_ dwarf .
"[04:54] Speaker_B | And cluster , you're right ."
[04:59] Speaker_C | There he is .
[05:01] Speaker_C | By Lyman alpha forest and Lyman limit systems .
[05:03] Speaker_B | But it's the same Lyman alpha forest systems again . So you're right there .
"[05:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[05:10] Speaker_B | Or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah , I think should still be absorption ."
[05:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:17] Speaker_B | Radio loud quasar again . You're right .
"[05:21] Speaker_C | Emission models , definitely not . Um why associated ?"
"[05:26] Speaker_B | I should definitely now we had a debate about this before , and I can't remember why I decided to mark associated . Um what does it mean ?"
[05:31] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:36] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:38] Speaker_C | It means it's associated with some physical thing , but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features , I don't think . Does it ?"
[05:47] Speaker_B | What is as associated absorption ?
[05:50] Speaker_B | Doesn't say it's associated with what .
"[05:51] Speaker_A | Well it's a process though , isn't it ."
[05:56] Speaker_A | Isn't it a process ?
[05:57] Speaker_B | I don't know . I've got no idea what it means .
[05:58] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[06:00] Speaker_C | I'm happy to say M_ two what-not absorption is a spectral feature . But associated means it's associated to some physical thing . So yeah . So that shouldn't be in .
[06:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:04] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[06:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . I wouldn't have that .
"[06:10] Speaker_B | Right , okay . So is that what it means in that c context ? Right . Um and associated again ."
[06:14] Speaker_C | Alright .
[06:16] Speaker_C | Yep .
[06:22] Speaker_C | Those are mechanisms . So they don't count . Don't think .
[06:23] Speaker_B | Mechanisms .
"[06:33] Speaker_C | Yep , I just missed it ."
[06:33] Speaker_B | Quasar .
[06:36] Speaker_C | And that's it .
"[06:40] Speaker_C | Hmm ? Yeah , we should do ."
"[06:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , we did that the same . But it's different from what we've been doing ."
[06:50] Speaker_B | We've just talked about n und underlining features .
[06:51] Speaker_A | Well I think y bu y y you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual . Uh um it's only altering earlier rules .
[06:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[07:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , and it's not in the manual , is it ?"
[07:02] Speaker_A | That aren't allowed .
"[07:03] Speaker_B | It doesn't say in the manual about features or not , but we d when we saw ones previously , we marked features ."
"[07:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , then then do , I think ."
[07:08] Speaker_C | Yeah . So let's do that . Extend .
[07:08] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[07:10] Speaker_B | Um yes . The only problem , it's done if we've both been not marking it , there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked ."
[07:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:20] Speaker_A | Y yeah , yeah , but yeah ."
[07:27] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[07:33] Speaker_B | Right , okay . Yeah ."
[07:33] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[07:38] Speaker_D | Have you do you've seen that there are the other one there , the quasar , right ? The uh right , sorry ."
"[07:41] Speaker_B | Yes , we've got quasars . And this is exactly the same as last one ."
[07:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:51] Speaker_C | Yep .
[07:55] Speaker_C | It's a kind of a regular galaxy ?
[07:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:07] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[08:08] Speaker_A | Just a p what are you doing there there , sorry ?"
"[08:09] Speaker_B | Hubble deep fields is being marked . And absorption shouldn't be marked , yep ."
"[08:12] Speaker_A | Yep . Isn't remote . Yeah , fine ."
[08:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:19] Speaker_B | I don't think able cluster is different from cluster . Hmm .
"[08:24] Speaker_A | Um yeah , that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have A_ bar clusters . So yeah ."
[08:29] Speaker_C | Ri right .
[08:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:35] Speaker_C | That definitely gets to go in .
"[08:39] Speaker_C | That's not a component . I think . Yeah , we could come to blows over soft excess ."
"[08:40] Speaker_A | No , I I'm I'm not arguing . I agree , yeah ."
"[08:41] Speaker_B | Yep , okay , we can have soft excess . Mm-hmm ."
"[08:46] Speaker_B | And yes , you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and Compton emission ."
[08:50] Speaker_C | Okay .
[08:51] Speaker_B | I think you're right on both of them .
[08:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[09:12] Speaker_C | Yeah . I agree . That's fine .
[09:16] Speaker_A | Do you want this one here ?
[09:17] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:17] Speaker_C | No .
"[09:20] Speaker_A | No ? Conti continuum . No , okay ."
"[09:21] Speaker_C | No , for continuum . Um ."
[09:21] Speaker_B | No continuum .
[09:25] Speaker_B | C_O_ luminosity .
[09:31] Speaker_A | I think that's a s species again .
"[09:33] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's fine ."
[09:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:37] Speaker_B | Oh it's still too hot .
[09:39] Speaker_C | Uh I can agree with taking that out .
"[09:54] Speaker_C | That the so-called yeah , I don't think it should be , should it ? 'Cause it's a region , yeah ."
[10:03] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[10:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's badly written ."
[10:18] Speaker_C | So it's just defined only by wave-length . So we can't include infrared galaxies .
"[10:21] Speaker_B | Yeah , just galaxies ."
"[10:28] Speaker_B | Star bursts . Yes , they do ."
"[10:28] Speaker_C | star bursts count , surely ."
"[10:32] Speaker_B | Oh . Yes , assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy . But they are talking about star burst galaxies ."
"[10:37] Speaker_C | Mm yes , yeah , they are ."
[10:43] Speaker_B | And galaxies .
[10:43] Speaker_C | Galaxies .
[10:48] Speaker_B | Mm continua or continuum flux .
[10:48] Speaker_C | Mm .
[10:52] Speaker_B | It's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference . But what did we decide ?
"[10:54] Speaker_C | It doesn't really matter . I'd say continuum flux but I don't Obviously . But I don't care . Yep , okay ."
[10:59] Speaker_B | Let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in .
"[11:01] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think you have ."
[11:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[11:08] Speaker_B | Broad line .
"[11:11] Speaker_B | I was gonna say put it in . Um The lack of broad line polarization . Broad line polarization , is that a spectral feature ? I think you'd want the whole thing in some extent ."
[11:27] Speaker_B | Ts you can't get it just from a spectrum .
[11:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:37] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[11:41] Speaker_B | As it is .
[11:45] Speaker_A | Br broad l
[11:49] Speaker_A | Line in it . Um because I think that's s what you have been doing earlier on .
"[11:51] Speaker_B | Polarization's a property . Yes , okay ."
[11:53] Speaker_C | Okay .
[11:54] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Yeah ?
[11:58] Speaker_B | Now I d don't know what was marked here . Have you got the bottom of this page ? Or is it cut off ?
[12:01] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[12:03] Speaker_D | Oops , no ."
[12:03] Speaker_C | Uh we're missing weak weak line.I don't oh y so they're saying weak line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy .
"[12:13] Speaker_B | No . I said that weak line was . Because the modifier should be included , which I think it should . Even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined . This should be green ."
"[12:26] Speaker_C | Okay , yeah ."
"[12:31] Speaker_B | Oh right , okay . Are we the same on the bottom line ?"
[12:32] Speaker_C | Okay .
[12:35] Speaker_C | Right .
"[12:39] Speaker_C | Oh . Yeah no , you've got line in there ."
"[12:39] Speaker_D | No , is it ?"
"[12:41] Speaker_A | The difference only weak line , isn't it ?"
[12:47] Speaker_C | And should come out .
[12:48] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . There's a line there as well . It's different .
[12:49] Speaker_B | So there's a right but I think weak line should be in .
[12:51] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[12:52] Speaker_A | And an and . Different as well .
"[12:53] Speaker_C | Okay , mm-hmm ."
[12:54] Speaker_B | Bec i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there .
[12:55] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:56] Speaker_C | Yep , that's okay ."
[13:00] Speaker_B | Right .
"[13:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't think that's a source type ."
[13:28] Speaker_B | Um line again .
[13:31] Speaker_C | Mm mm-hmm .
"[13:32] Speaker_B | But we've got emission line in the ratios . That's fine . Infrared galaxies . That's right again . Oh no , is it ? No , it's wrong . Yeah ."
[13:37] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[13:38] Speaker_C | No , it's not right . Right ."
[13:42] Speaker_B | I'll get this .
"[13:46] Speaker_C | Uh line emitting gas I don't like , yeah ."
[13:47] Speaker_B | Line .
[13:53] Speaker_C | Far infrared galaxies we can't have .
[13:58] Speaker_C | That's okay .
"[14:02] Speaker_B | Making emission feature , which we're including now ."
"[14:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's okay ."
"[14:08] Speaker_C | Damped Lyman alpha absorption the same . Right , yep . Emission feature ."
[14:12] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[14:18] Speaker_B | No , we can't . Star forming galaxies should be in ."
[14:19] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[14:23] Speaker_C | Uh yes , it should be . Yep , that should be in ."
[14:26] Speaker_B | Yeah . Proto-galactic lump . W Not gonna get away with that one . It's a lump . It's something . Emission feature again .
"[14:28] Speaker_A | No , they just made that up as well . No ."
[14:29] Speaker_C | That is not a source type .
[14:32] Speaker_C | What were you thinking ? Yeah . Dibulae absorption .
"[14:41] Speaker_B | That should be because it's not an absorber , it's an absorption . Oh , covers , yeah ."
"[14:43] Speaker_C | No , but it says it covers a significantly small angular size . It's a physical thing ."
[14:44] Speaker_A | That's a process though .
"[14:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's a process or a source ."
[14:52] Speaker_A | I'm sorry .
"[14:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , you cross 'em out . Features ."
"[14:56] Speaker_C | Yep . Uh this feature . Yeah , okay ."
[14:59] Speaker_B | A feature again .
[15:04] Speaker_B | Is a feature a spectral feature . damped Lyman alphas again .
"[15:12] Speaker_C | Those are those are regions , globs , nebulae ."
[15:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:25] Speaker_B | Now a line should be in .
[15:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:33] Speaker_B | X_ ray B_ L_ .
"[15:33] Speaker_C | X_ ray B_L_ lax . Yep , that's okay ."
[15:38] Speaker_C | Intermediate types . It now if we're d
[15:38] Speaker_B | Intermediate .
"[15:40] Speaker_B | We put in type type one point nine . Yes , I think it should be in ."
[15:42] Speaker_C | Did we in the end ? Yeah ? Oh right . You get it then .
[15:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:51] Speaker_C | That doesn't go in and that's okay .
"[15:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . Oh gosh , this looks complicated . Oh it's just it's Lyman alpha absorption ."
[16:02] Speaker_B | And we don't like that one .
[16:07] Speaker_B | And we don't like that one .
"[16:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's okay ."
[16:20] Speaker_A | Well hang on though . But wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line ?
[16:27] Speaker_B | Yes we are taking out line on its own . So we ha yes .
[16:29] Speaker_C | Are we ?
"[16:31] Speaker_C | Okay , yep ."
"[16:37] Speaker_B | Yes , I think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line ?"
[16:38] Speaker_C | What line are we taking out ?
"[16:47] Speaker_B | Okay , it's line width , but it's st it's still where it says lines . Have we had any just where it says line ratios ?"
"[16:47] Speaker_C | Line width , yeah ."
[16:52] Speaker_C | Line ratios . We've been taking out line as a
[16:56] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[16:58] Speaker_C | word that relates to other words . My head is going yeah . But lines are still lines . Yeah , that's okay ."
"[17:00] Speaker_A | Adjective . Uh yes . Right . Okay , okay . Okay . Yeah , okay , fine ."
[17:05] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[17:05] Speaker_B | Yes , I think you're right ."
[17:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[17:12] Speaker_C | Right , I agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing ."
[17:19] Speaker_B | No . We want the whole thing in there .
[17:20] Speaker_C | Absorption features in the U_V_ spectra .
[17:23] Speaker_B | Or in the U_V_ . I don't think spectrum should be there . But if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in .
[17:31] Speaker_C | Okay .
[17:33] Speaker_C | It's likely one spectrum in the U_V_ which you can see absorption features in . Uh Right . Quasars quasars .
[17:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:42] Speaker_C | Uh-huh . Yeah , I'm right . And here I think I'm right again ."
"[17:44] Speaker_B | Yep , you're right ."
"[17:48] Speaker_B | Line centre you can point to . Not like line width , but you can point to line centre . In fact the whole thing should be highlighted , I think ."
[17:56] Speaker_C | Line centre .
[17:58] Speaker_B | You can point to the line wings .
"[17:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , you'd you'd say line wings . Alright , you get it ."
"[18:08] Speaker_C | Right , you win . Um eclipsing I don't think ."
"[18:12] Speaker_B | Yep , no that shouldn't be in there ."
"[18:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , you're right there ."
"[18:22] Speaker_B | Mm you're right , star burst . Oh , star burst active star burst like activity , that's I don't think that's a class ."
[18:33] Speaker_B | It's a action .
"[18:34] Speaker_C | Y yeah , but then the A_G_N_ like activity ."
"[18:37] Speaker_A | Yeah . That has to go as well then , surely ."
[18:38] Speaker_B | But A_ g but a an A_ an A_G_N_ is a class .
[18:39] Speaker_C | So both of them have to go . A star burst is a class .
[18:41] Speaker_A | A star burst is a class .
[18:46] Speaker_A | As is an A_G_N_ .
[18:46] Speaker_C | An A_G_N_ .
"[18:48] Speaker_B | But an A_G_N_ is an object . The star burst , you can't say here is a star burst ."
[18:51] Speaker_C | But we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies .
"[18:59] Speaker_C | No , but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it . Like an A_G_ an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an A_G_N_ in it ."
[19:12] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[19:14] Speaker_D | Wait , fr from the linguistic side , if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects , then I think it sh it should stay in in this case , even though it's modified by activity , or it's it's m modifying activity actually ."
[19:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[19:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[19:26] Speaker_C | I think they're the same . They either have to both stay or both go , and I I think they should stay ."
[19:28] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
[19:30] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[19:33] Speaker_C | Yeah . Star formation we weren't putting in .
"[19:46] Speaker_B | You're right , it's two ."
[19:49] Speaker_C | Or was it's a wave-length region . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
"[19:50] Speaker_B | It's a wave length region , but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line ."
"[20:00] Speaker_B | You are , yes . That's all part of the name ."
[20:04] Speaker_B | Line ratios ?
[20:06] Speaker_C | Mm 'kay .
[20:09] Speaker_C | Infrared galaxies . This time you have it . But galaxies should be in .
[20:12] Speaker_B | But galaxy should be in .
[20:15] Speaker_B | So we need to write that .
"[20:24] Speaker_C | Uh oh , what have we done ?"
"[20:26] Speaker_B | Oh no , they are the same . Sorry , I missed that ."
[20:30] Speaker_B | Absorption line systems . Hubble . And hubble . And galaxy .
[20:32] Speaker_C | Hubble .
"[20:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , ok i in the galaxy distribution ."
[20:38] Speaker_B | Galaxy distribution .
[20:41] Speaker_B | Still the distribution of galaxies .
[20:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[20:45] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[20:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , we did it before ."
"[20:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's okay ."
[20:56] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:57] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[20:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
[21:05] Speaker_B | Open that radius button .
"[21:05] Speaker_C | We weren't doing spectral shapes , were we ?"
"[21:08] Speaker_B | Yes , don't include Platt's spectrum ."
[21:14] Speaker_B | Quasars .
"[21:15] Speaker_C | Yeah , that counts ."
[21:20] Speaker_B | Low ionization . Mm but three should be in .
[21:26] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[21:28] Speaker_B | Um low ionization , th they're low BALs , aren't they ?"
[21:30] Speaker_A | Um are they uh if you say so . Okay .
[21:34] Speaker_B | Low BAL is a separate class of source .
"[21:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true ."
"[21:38] Speaker_B | Um , I I don't know if high BALs are , but low BALs are ."
[21:39] Speaker_C | That counts .
[21:41] Speaker_C | They are and it's a big joke . High balls . Uh yeah .
[21:42] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[21:44] Speaker_B | Oh right , yeah . Yeah ."
[21:56] Speaker_B | I shouldn't you're right there .
[21:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , that doesn't go in . That means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it . Yeah . That doesn't count ."
[22:04] Speaker_B | Emission line candidates .
"[22:07] Speaker_B | Yes , you're right ."
"[22:12] Speaker_B | Continuum I think should be in , aren't they ? Although I was talking about conti yeah , continuum luminosity continuum flux , it should be in ."
[22:16] Speaker_C | Mm continuum luminosities .
"[22:19] Speaker_A | Well you haven't been earlier , have you ?"
[22:24] Speaker_C | I don't remember about luminosities . We've been putting in continuum flux .
[22:28] Speaker_A | Have you ? Oh okay . Okay .
[22:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[22:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , we weren't doing broad band detections . We were doing yeah ."
[22:42] Speaker_C | Mm .
[22:44] Speaker_B | This is nice tea .
[22:46] Speaker_C | Mine too . Oh .
"[22:50] Speaker_C | Radio loud quasar should be in , Z_ equals two shouldn't . The rule was to leave it in , was it ?"
"[23:00] Speaker_B | I don't know , 'cause you in language speak , mark each as a separate entity . That's different ."
"[23:08] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's for things marked with and ."
"[23:13] Speaker_B | Mark sub-sections of entities t no , that's different . Doesn't really say ."
"[23:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , it doesn't say ."
[23:18] Speaker_B | So we need a rule for that .
[23:28] Speaker_B | What have we done t
[23:28] Speaker_D | Is is goo again or is it really Z_ equals two ?
[23:31] Speaker_B | Z_ equals two .
[23:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[23:39] Speaker_D | Alright .
[23:43] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[23:46] Speaker_D | If it was radio-loud quasar , then you would mark it as one thing ?"
[23:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:54] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[23:54] Speaker_B | As one , okay ."
[23:55] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[23:57] Speaker_B | Let's whatever's easiest for you . Y Um yes , take it out . , isn't it ? The spectral components ."
[24:00] Speaker_C | No .
[24:06] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:07] Speaker_C | No .
[24:12] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[24:14] Speaker_B | Hubble deep field again .
[24:16] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[24:19] Speaker_C | Mm no , we can't have that ."
[24:19] Speaker_B | Emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them .
[24:23] Speaker_C | Yep .
[24:33] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:33] Speaker_B | I think that's right .
[24:37] Speaker_C | Oh .
[24:47] Speaker_B | I_G_M_ I've done again .
[24:53] Speaker_B | This is nice and easy .
[24:55] Speaker_C | Yes . Um yeah .
[25:00] Speaker_B | Components .
[25:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:06] Speaker_C | We can rid of that , can't we ?"
[25:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think so .
[25:09] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . But we want the line still .
[25:18] Speaker_B | The galaxy or galaxy ? Given that it is the galaxy .
[25:18] Speaker_C | Galaxy with the galaxy .
"[25:24] Speaker_B | It should be the galaxy , I guess . Insert proper whatever the word is ."
"[25:24] Speaker_C | It should be the galaxy , yeah ."
"[25:31] Speaker_C | H_V_C_ complexes . I don't know what H_V_C_ stands for , but since they're complexes we can cross it out . Huh ? Do you know what H_V_C_ stands for ?"
"[25:38] Speaker_B | H_V_C_ , is it this ?"
[25:42] Speaker_B | Known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds . That's where they are . They shouldn't be in there .
[25:42] Speaker_A | No .
"[25:45] Speaker_C | Yeah , that doesn't count ."
[25:45] Speaker_A | High velocity clouds . There . That's right .
"[25:48] Speaker_B | Yes , but they don't explain . I_C_M_ ."
[25:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[25:54] Speaker_B | Scuba .
[25:59] Speaker_B | Sometimes anyway when it works .
"[26:02] Speaker_C | You're right there . Should be this and it probably is , that's probably what that means ."
"[26:06] Speaker_B | No , but no , you're right , and this should be red as well . It should all be . Narrow line A_G_N_ are different ."
"[26:10] Speaker_C | Oh , I see . Yeah ."
[26:14] Speaker_B | I missed out that .
[26:15] Speaker_C | Right .
[26:38] Speaker_C | I don't think that matters very much .
"[26:40] Speaker_B | Just keep H_ beta , I think . Given that we're not putting line width itself . Even line if it is line width ."
[26:43] Speaker_C | Okay .
[26:49] Speaker_B | You can have flux .
[26:51] Speaker_C | Hurray .
"[27:08] Speaker_C | Um oh , beta , yep ."
[27:10] Speaker_B | H_ beta should be in .
[27:17] Speaker_C | Mm no .
"[27:18] Speaker_B | Not that line , but we want enhanced ."
[27:20] Speaker_C | Do we ?
[27:21] Speaker_A | Why ?
"[27:21] Speaker_B | We we wanted , and this is relative , we wanted modifiers of modifiers of spectral lines , E_G_ weak broad lines ."
[27:30] Speaker_C | But enhanced relative to what ?
"[27:33] Speaker_B | I weak w relative to what though ? It's all relative , but it's still a modifier of that line ."
[27:40] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[27:44] Speaker_D | Um so sorry , and the the A_G_N_ , I think that should be one entity , right ? The the uh w wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule , the first one ?"
"[27:56] Speaker_A | Y yes , that's right ."
[27:59] Speaker_D | Mark the la la . Mark the whole string as one entity . One acronym .
"[28:02] Speaker_B | No , only when it's embedded . Oh , but the second one . Oh , it's included beside mark it all as one entity , yes ."
[28:02] Speaker_C | But when yeah .
[28:10] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[28:18] Speaker_B | Yes , I don't know how many times I've missed the ."
"[28:20] Speaker_C | Yeah , I've missed that a lot ."
[28:20] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm .
[28:32] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
[28:35] Speaker_A | Really ?
"[28:37] Speaker_B | Mm . If we're including it , emission"
[28:41] Speaker_A | Are you ? N
[28:47] Speaker_A | No .
"[28:48] Speaker_B | No , that's true , so we shouldn't have done either of those . But then weak yeah , okay , nothing at all ."
[28:50] Speaker_A | No .
[28:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:52] Speaker_C | Weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah , I agree . Done ."
[28:52] Speaker_A | Nor weak emission then .
[28:54] Speaker_A | No .
[29:01] Speaker_C | Star burst contribution .
[29:04] Speaker_B | That's not a separate source .
"[29:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's true ."
[29:10] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . Sorry . Yeah .
[29:12] Speaker_B | Red continuum should be in .
[29:12] Speaker_C | Red continuum . Okay .
[29:15] Speaker_B | Broad line emission and the rest frame U_V_ should all be one .
[29:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[29:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , that should be out ."
"[29:25] Speaker_B | You're right , yeah . Oh . No , it shouldn't ."
[29:30] Speaker_A | No .
"[29:31] Speaker_B | Oh yes , sorry , you're right ."
[29:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[29:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , this is this a radio transfer thing . So they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape ."
[29:36] Speaker_B | Lines .
[29:44] Speaker_C | Not that that's not something you can point to . I don't think that counts .
"[29:47] Speaker_B | Yes , that's true ."
"[29:53] Speaker_B | Associated again , which means nothing . Continuum source shouldn't be in ."
[29:56] Speaker_C | Mm .
[29:59] Speaker_C | Uh-uh .
[30:01] Speaker_B | And associated shouldn't be in .
[30:05] Speaker_B | C_T_I_I_O_ . What does it stand for ?
"[30:06] Speaker_C | Mm that should be oh wait , is that s that's an observatory , isn't it ? The C_T_ is the C_T_I_O_ four metre uh the name of that telescope ?"
[30:15] Speaker_B | That is a separate thing .
"[30:17] Speaker_A | Um m uh y ye well , I don't know ."
[30:19] Speaker_C | No .
[30:20] Speaker_B | Y yeah .
[30:32] Speaker_B | The C_T_I_O_ four metre telescope is must be what it's called . Otherwise they'd call it a name .
[30:37] Speaker_A | Hmm . That's the actually usually . But anyway . I don't mind .
[30:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:48] Speaker_B | If it's part of the proper name of an instrument .
[30:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:51] Speaker_A | Yeah . I gue I guess keep it then . Yeah , I think so ."
[30:52] Speaker_C | But then we have to include four metre as well .
"[30:54] Speaker_B | Yes , up the telescope ? No , just four metre ."
[30:56] Speaker_C | No . Yeah .
[30:59] Speaker_C | Right .
[31:04] Speaker_B | Ion shouldn't be in there .
"[31:04] Speaker_C | Yep , I agree . Mm-hmm ."
"[31:07] Speaker_B | Oh no , it should . Iron and absorption . Is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines ? No , it's not ."
"[31:13] Speaker_C | What is that comma doing there ? Yeah , no oh , I see , I see , I see , yeah . Accounting for galactic reddening contamination from blended iron . What they mean is blended iron lines ."
"[31:15] Speaker_B | It's no , it's not . I if the comma wasn't there , it would be in ."
"[31:22] Speaker_A | Blended ion lines , yeah . Yes , you do mean ion lines . Yeah ."
[31:24] Speaker_B | So they do mean iron line . So so it should be in .
[31:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[31:28] Speaker_B | And we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths , yeah ."
[31:32] Speaker_B | Continuum flux we should have all in .
[31:41] Speaker_C | No . Uh yeah . Damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_ .
[31:51] Speaker_B | I don't think that's a separate class of quasar . But then I don't know about quasars .
[31:56] Speaker_C | Uh I don't know what that means either . One damped Lyman alpha Q_S_O_s .
[31:59] Speaker_B | I think it should p
"[32:03] Speaker_C | It's not a source type , that's definitely true ."
[32:04] Speaker_A | No .
[32:12] Speaker_C | What's D_A_ ?
[32:16] Speaker_C | And there's W_D_s .
[32:18] Speaker_C | It's twenty five of D_A_ type and six of D_B_ type .
"[32:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's if it has"
[32:22] Speaker_A | h h
[32:24] Speaker_A | Hydrogen or h helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs . Yeah .
[32:29] Speaker_C | Yep .
[32:34] Speaker_B | Nope .
[32:34] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[32:36] Speaker_C | Yes , you're fine with that ."
[32:38] Speaker_B | Low BAL .
[32:46] Speaker_B | Mm I'd put multiple in there .
[32:52] Speaker_B | We're not supposed to do components .
"[32:55] Speaker_A | No , that's right . That all goes ."
[32:55] Speaker_C | Nope .
[32:56] Speaker_B | I say neither of them .
[32:57] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[32:58] Speaker_B | Or yeah , that's right ."
[33:00] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[33:04] Speaker_B | No absorption lines . That should be highlighted . Oh sorry , I'm I me"
[33:04] Speaker_C | No luminos
[33:21] Speaker_C | Yeah . People discuss them as a separate class .
[33:26] Speaker_C | They are as as much as ultra-luminous galaxies are .
[33:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:31] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[33:34] Speaker_B | No absorption lines should be in , and the same here ."
"[33:34] Speaker_C | And yep , that should be in ."
[33:40] Speaker_B | I didn't . Nice not to do associated for once .
[33:43] Speaker_C | Excellent .
[33:46] Speaker_C | Regions . I shouldn't have done that .
"[33:49] Speaker_B | Y yes , you shouldn't ."
"[33:57] Speaker_C | Oh , A_ and B_ ."
"[33:58] Speaker_B | And we w oh gosh , what were we gonna to do about A_ and again ?"
"[34:00] Speaker_C | No , that's the conjunctural . I'm right here , I think . If yeah ."
"[34:05] Speaker_B | Yes , you are right , yeah ."
[34:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[34:10] Speaker_B | Strong soft X_ ray flux .
"[34:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , you can point to that ."
"[34:14] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's okay ."
[34:18] Speaker_B | And that's associated absorption lines .
"[34:22] Speaker_C | Oh . Right . In the A_A_L_ outflow , it's a r yeah , that doesn't count ."
"[34:26] Speaker_A | But it's a region though , isn't it ."
[34:31] Speaker_B | And absorption and small clouds is out .
[34:33] Speaker_C | It doesn't count .
"[34:39] Speaker_B | Ah , now this is the conjunct rule again . And I've done blue wings of this and this and this ."
[34:42] Speaker_C | And I didn't Ooh . How do you know what's going on here ?
[34:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:48] Speaker_B | And this is one double line . And this . And presumably that's red there . It goes over there . I think i if the line's too long , y you've highlighted all i as one . But and I've highlighted it separately . It should be separate ."
[34:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[34:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't know what this means . Oh , I highlighted all as one , right ."
"[35:06] Speaker_C | Okay , yeah ."
"[35:12] Speaker_B | I think if the line's too long , it's only ha putting the bottom line because Olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line ."
[35:19] Speaker_A | Ye ye
"[35:20] Speaker_C | The N_ should be . Yeah , yeah ."
"[35:22] Speaker_B | Yes , but I think it probably was and just hasn't printed because Olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen O_ two . Almo two lines above ."
[35:25] Speaker_D | Right .
[35:30] Speaker_C | Mm . Hmm ?
"[35:32] Speaker_B | Yeah , but I think it's just m missing out the printing if the line goes over the end . 'Cause if you look at you look at what Olivia's done here , Olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line . She would have highlighted the whole thing ."
[35:34] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[35:36] Speaker_C | Oh , I see . So your N_ starts yep , yep , I see what you mean ."
[35:38] Speaker_D | Hmm . Yeah .
[35:43] Speaker_C | Mm .
[35:43] Speaker_D | But Yeah . But it's s so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually .
[35:45] Speaker_C | So N_ probably should be highli
"[35:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , and it's just hasn't printed that . But it is marked I think ."
[35:51] Speaker_C | Yep .
[35:54] Speaker_D | Right .
[35:56] Speaker_C | Absorption components don't count .
[35:59] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[36:00] Speaker_C | Continuum source , does that count ? Shouldn't be ."
[36:08] Speaker_C | Mm oh so it is . That's right .
[36:13] Speaker_B | But it's al is that also the name of the source ?
"[36:15] Speaker_C | Probably , yeah ."
[36:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[36:16] Speaker_B | So it should be this one plus the pink .
[36:21] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[36:29] Speaker_B | Line broadness , and I think that should be in ."
[36:35] Speaker_B | That's true . Well okay yeah . So we've been in here . Alright .
[36:54] Speaker_B | Rich iron spectrum .
[37:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[37:29] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[37:34] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[37:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[37:40] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[37:42] Speaker_B | It's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum , you can say this is a rich iron spectrum ."
[37:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[37:43] Speaker_A | But b yeah i
"[37:44] Speaker_C | Yep , that's the rich iron spectrum . I agree , let's get rid of it ."
"[37:46] Speaker_D | Oh , I see ."
"[37:47] Speaker_A | That's right , it's it yeah ."
"[37:49] Speaker_D | So in that sense it's like like a derived property . Yeah , I see , uh-huh ."
[37:49] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[37:51] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
"[37:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so ."
"[37:53] Speaker_B | Yes , it's not a spectral feature . It's feature of the spectrum , which is different ."
[37:54] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
"[37:55] Speaker_C | Right , that's not shouldn't go in ."
[37:57] Speaker_D | Mm .
[37:59] Speaker_B | Yes .
[38:01] Speaker_B | And then with the same .
[38:01] Speaker_C | Is that everything ? Yeah . Okay .
"[38:04] Speaker_B | Gosh , we're getting through this now . Um giant ellipticals or ellipticals ."
"[38:06] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah , we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break ."
[38:16] Speaker_C | Are giant ellipticals separate things ? I don't know .
"[38:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so ."
"[38:19] Speaker_B | They are separate , but are they a separate class ? I think they probably are in the ETA B_T_G_s and things ."
[38:22] Speaker_A | I think so . Yeah .
[38:22] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay .
[38:26] Speaker_C | Line emitting gas doesn't get in .
[38:30] Speaker_B | Ionized emission .
[38:33] Speaker_C | If you're doing emission from high yeah .
"[38:35] Speaker_B | Yes , I think you want ionized in there ."
[38:39] Speaker_A | Really ? Really ? You think ?
[38:40] Speaker_C | Hmm ?
"[39:01] Speaker_A | Okay , if you both think so . Yeah ."
[39:01] Speaker_C | No .
"[39:09] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay , okay ."
[39:10] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[39:10] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[39:14] Speaker_B | Line ratio .
"[39:19] Speaker_B | What's different there ? Oh there , yes ."
[39:28] Speaker_B | Narrow line Seyfert one should all be one . With the red inside it .
[39:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[39:40] Speaker_C | This is describing the band you do the observations in ?
[39:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[39:44] Speaker_B | It's describing the line you're looking for .
"[39:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so ."
"[39:47] Speaker_C | Yeah , that counts ? Alright ."
[39:49] Speaker_B | We've included it before when you've said this has been detected .
"[39:51] Speaker_C | Right , okay ."
[39:59] Speaker_B | From I think should be in there .
"[40:03] Speaker_C | S Yeah , okay . Yep ."
[40:05] Speaker_B | E emission lines .
[40:10] Speaker_B | Quasars I missed .
[40:11] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[40:14] Speaker_C | Ooh . Those shouldn't be there , should they ?"
[40:18] Speaker_C | No .
"[40:18] Speaker_B | Damped Lyman also is not systems , yeah ."
"[40:20] Speaker_C | Oh okay , okay , okay ."
"[40:29] Speaker_A | Is it just um to s scrub your mechanism there ? It isn't uh a spectral feature such as oh , it's a process ."
[40:36] Speaker_C | Ne yes .
"[40:38] Speaker_B | Mm no , I think it's a spectral feature . You can point to the damped Lyman a alpha resorption , in in the same way you can point to H_ beta emission , although H_ beta emission is a process . Or emission from H_ beta is is a process ."
"[40:47] Speaker_C | I think this is what we agreed to cross out before , isn't it ?"
[40:47] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[40:55] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[41:01] Speaker_A | I think it's a process myself .
[41:05] Speaker_C | Especially when uh they're saying we're y we're choosing low red-shift absorption . That's not really something you can point to .
[41:19] Speaker_B | Mm you can point to low red shift damped Lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there .
"[41:23] Speaker_C | Mm . I'm not too fast , I don't think ."
[41:31] Speaker_B | would it be if it was H_ beta absorption ?
[41:37] Speaker_B | And you just took out the low red shifts . Quasars with H_ beta absorption you'd put in .
[41:43] Speaker_C | Mm no I'm not sure .
[41:50] Speaker_C | It's whether it's a process or a a feature . But I can't remember what we've done before .
[41:53] Speaker_B | I think it's both .
[41:57] Speaker_B | Because we've every feature is produced by a process .
"[41:59] Speaker_C | Well if it was if it was absorption and damped Lyman alpha clouds , you'd not mark absorption ."
"[42:05] Speaker_B | Yes , it's depends whether it has t whether it means with low red shift damped Lyman alpha cloud absorption ."
"[42:18] Speaker_C | I do think it's a process , I think ."
"[42:20] Speaker_B | It's a process , but it also produces a spectral feature , where you can say there's the damped Lyman alpha absorption , there's the in the same way that the , yeah , H_ beta emission is a process . Yeah , I think it should be in there ."
[42:25] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well that's true . That is true .
[42:26] Speaker_C | Hmm ? Mm ?
[42:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[42:32] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay , okay ."
[42:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[42:56] Speaker_B | But just talk about the micro-quasar .
"[43:05] Speaker_B | Mm on the other hand if we're having hyper-luminous galaxies where , you know , they've just got ultra-luminous and oh , even more hyper-luminous . Well someone must have made that up for the first time ."
[43:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[43:22] Speaker_B | Same as a hyper-luminous galaxy being very very extreme .
[43:27] Speaker_C | But .
"[43:27] Speaker_A | I guess keep it probably , yeah ."
"[43:40] Speaker_A | No , they've made that one up certainly . I've never heard of that one before ."
"[43:42] Speaker_C | Uh yeah , you y there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies . So that do we say we take that out ?"
[43:47] Speaker_A | No .
"[43:54] Speaker_C | Yep , that's it in it . So that's okay , yep ."
[44:03] Speaker_B | You're right . Oh .
[44:07] Speaker_B | The object .
"[44:10] Speaker_B | If it was star burst galaxies , it would be in there ."
"[44:15] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right . Yeah , I wouldn't , yeah ."
[44:23] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[44:36] Speaker_D | Oh okay . Alright , okay . I see , mm-hmm ."
[44:39] Speaker_B | Then it has to be in there .
[44:43] Speaker_B | Continuum flux you can have .
[44:45] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[44:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[44:53] Speaker_A | I think all of that goes then , doesn't it ?"
[45:00] Speaker_A | Surely . No .
"[45:01] Speaker_C | We wouldn't have line ratios . So yeah , that goes ."
"[45:03] Speaker_B | U_V_ and optical emi U_V_ and optical emission should be in there though . No , it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios ."
"[45:09] Speaker_A | No , I don't think anybody goes ."
"[45:09] Speaker_C | Yeah . No , it modifies ratios ."
[45:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[45:18] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[45:26] Speaker_C | Right . Yep , that's fine ."
[45:40] Speaker_B | T_V_ gamma ray emission .
[45:46] Speaker_C | We weren't doing broad-band detections . Right .
"[45:47] Speaker_B | We weren't doing broad-band detections , yeah ? Using the . It is , yes . Very stupid , but it is ."
[45:48] Speaker_A | Mm no .
[45:52] Speaker_C | That's definitely an instrument name .
"[45:59] Speaker_C | Right , you're right there ."
[46:02] Speaker_B | F_B_S_ objects shouldn't be in there .
[46:06] Speaker_C | What does it mean ?
"[46:09] Speaker_B | I don't know , but it's got object ."
"[46:10] Speaker_C | Yep , you're right ."
"[46:13] Speaker_B | And the MAMA scanning machine is an instrument , it's not a telescope , it's an instrument ."
"[46:17] Speaker_A | It's an instrument , yeah ."
[46:18] Speaker_C | Yeah . Okay . So you can have that .
[46:23] Speaker_C | Right . At the other one we stopped after four metre . So maybe we should do that there as well .
"[46:26] Speaker_B | Oh yes , it should be ."
[46:32] Speaker_B | Narrow emission lines from high iron yeah .
[46:33] Speaker_C | Yeah . We did it this way before .
[46:40] Speaker_B | Absorption features .
[46:47] Speaker_B | Weak continuum . That should be separate .
"[46:49] Speaker_C | Yeah , you're right ."
[46:55] Speaker_B | Continuum radiation .
[46:59] Speaker_C | No . Neither .
[47:00] Speaker_B | Neither .
[47:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[47:08] Speaker_B | Yep .
[47:19] Speaker_B | Narrow line emission should be in .
[47:22] Speaker_C | Yep .
[47:46] Speaker_C | Uh we didn't allow iron spectrum . So we shouldn't allow H_ or helium two O_ spectrum either .
"[47:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right ."
"[47:55] Speaker_B | At all , yep . And we shouldn't allow emission ."
[47:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[48:07] Speaker_B | Radio quasars ? Yeah . Oh , no , radio loud and radio quiet are ."
[48:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[48:08] Speaker_C | Radio quasars are s type .
[48:14] Speaker_C | But radio quasars means radio loud quasars .
"[48:20] Speaker_C | U_V_ accessors are right , isn't it ? It's a spectral feature ."
[48:23] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[48:32] Speaker_C | No .
[48:35] Speaker_C | Were we ?
"[48:35] Speaker_B | Ye I think they're a separate class , yes . We're not putting them in spectral , but I think we are putting them in because it's so broad band . But yes , they are separate ."
[48:39] Speaker_C | Right .
[48:43] Speaker_C | Right . Uh you're right there .
[48:50] Speaker_C | Line strengths .
"[49:01] Speaker_B | No , you can't point to it , yeah ."
"[49:01] Speaker_C | Means equivalent widths , yeah ."
[49:06] Speaker_B | Missed group .
"[49:10] Speaker_B | Subaru telescope , you're right ."
[49:15] Speaker_A | That's it . Hurray .
[49:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[49:22] Speaker_A | Well , very good ."
"[49:23] Speaker_C | Hurray , we're done . Excellent ."
[49:24] Speaker_B | Wonderful .
[49:25] Speaker_D | Under two hours . Amazing .
[49:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[49:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[49:43] Speaker_C | Oh .
[49:44] Speaker_C | Do we each remain wired up ? Are we done ?
"[49:47] Speaker_D | I th I think so , yeah ."
[49:49] Speaker_C | Excellent .

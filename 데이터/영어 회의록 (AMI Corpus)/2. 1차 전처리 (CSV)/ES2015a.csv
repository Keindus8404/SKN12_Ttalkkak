[03:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[03:40] Speaker_A | And uh tool training
"[03:43] Speaker_A | is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control ."
"[04:09] Speaker_A | Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design ."
[04:40] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:42] Speaker_B | So this is a television remote control ? Yeah .
"[04:45] Speaker_A | Yes , it's a television remote control ."
"[04:50] Speaker_A | Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright ."
[04:57] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[05:01] Speaker_A | Um , yeah ."
"[05:08] Speaker_A | Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um"
"[05:19] Speaker_A | come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design ."
"[05:36] Speaker_A | So , um ,"
"[05:44] Speaker_A | and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh ,"
[05:57] Speaker_B | Yeah . Got those notes .
[05:57] Speaker_D | Yeah . Thank you .
"[06:02] Speaker_A | One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now ."
[06:36] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:40] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:41] Speaker_C | Gosh .
"[06:52] Speaker_A | 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ?"
"[06:58] Speaker_B | Oh , to go first . Oh , are we all doing it individually ?"
"[07:09] Speaker_A | My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,"
"[07:30] Speaker_A | Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah ."
"[07:40] Speaker_A | Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head ."
[07:46] Speaker_B | Do you have elk where you come from ?
[07:49] Speaker_A | Yes . Yeah we have moose and we have deer .
[07:50] Speaker_B | You do .
[07:52] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[08:12] Speaker_D | Oh , very shapely ."
[08:14] Speaker_B | Brilliant .
"[08:14] Speaker_A | Okay . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh"
"[08:43] Speaker_A | it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself ."
[08:52] Speaker_B | Mm .
[08:53] Speaker_A | Yeah . Right .
[08:53] Speaker_B | Very nice . Okay .
"[09:09] Speaker_A | Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals ."
[09:25] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[09:30] Speaker_B | It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind ."
[10:31] Speaker_A | Great .
"[10:41] Speaker_C | Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . Um ,"
[10:48] Speaker_B | Ooh .
[11:00] Speaker_A | I forget her name .
"[11:01] Speaker_C | right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog ."
[11:03] Speaker_D | or Tara .
"[11:11] Speaker_C | It's a cartoon dog I think . A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . It's a scary cartoon dog ."
"[12:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's true ."
"[12:25] Speaker_D | Alrighty . I feel like a robot . Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that ."
"[12:49] Speaker_D | At first I thought it was a dead leaf . And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this ."
[13:05] Speaker_A | It's kinda like a peacock .
"[13:06] Speaker_D | Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go ."
[13:28] Speaker_A | Great .
[13:36] Speaker_A | Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?
[13:42] Speaker_A | Right .
"[13:46] Speaker_A | So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um"
[13:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[14:23] Speaker_A | we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um"
"[14:31] Speaker_A | to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents ."
"[15:03] Speaker_D | Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty ."
"[15:10] Speaker_A | I'm bad at math . 'Kay . Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um"
[15:11] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[15:21] Speaker_A | it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um"
"[15:28] Speaker_A | suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them ."
[15:42] Speaker_A | Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?
[15:45] Speaker_D | I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .
"[15:49] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?"
[15:53] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[15:55] Speaker_B | I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? So maybe if you could have some kind of"
"[16:06] Speaker_B | tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost ."
[16:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .
"[16:20] Speaker_C | Do yous not find that , um ,"
[16:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[16:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[16:36] Speaker_D | There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . That's useful . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button ."
[16:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . Yeah ."
[16:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:06] Speaker_A | Any ideas will do that you have at this point .
[17:08] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[17:18] Speaker_A | Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there ."
[17:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:32] Speaker_B | I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . So , hmm ."
[17:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:52] Speaker_A | And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous ."
[17:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:00] Speaker_A | Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for ."
[18:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:26] Speaker_D | Interface ? Oh , industrial ."
[18:27] Speaker_A | Industrial Designer . I have to remember these things . Um .
"[18:31] Speaker_A | You'll be beginning your , your working design . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 'Kay ."
[18:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .

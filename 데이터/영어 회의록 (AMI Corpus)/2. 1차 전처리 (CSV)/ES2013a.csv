"[03:07] Speaker_B | Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on ."
"[03:11] Speaker_A | And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around ."
"[03:37] Speaker_A | Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard ."

[04:59] Speaker_A | A mouse-y ?
"[05:00] Speaker_C | That's not a mouse-y , no ."
[05:02] Speaker_B | No it's not a mouse .

[05:18] Speaker_C | A ratty .
"[05:20] Speaker_A | Not a mouse , a rat ."
[05:20] Speaker_B | A webbed foot . Webbed f Oh right .
[05:26] Speaker_C | It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .
[05:30] Speaker_A | And your favourite characteristics of that animal .
[05:31] Speaker_C | I love whiskers .
[05:34] Speaker_C | Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and
[05:40] Speaker_C | uh fantastic pets and very friendly . And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .
[05:41] Speaker_A | Oh . Okay . Kate ?
[05:52] Speaker_D | Thanks .
"[06:19] Speaker_A | Oh , a fish ."
[06:21] Speaker_C | A shark ?
"[06:27] Speaker_D | Mm this is very representational fish . Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so ."
"[06:30] Speaker_A | Oh , okay . Fine ."
[06:32] Speaker_A | Favourite characteristics ?
[06:41] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[06:43] Speaker_D | Do you have a favourite one ?
[06:51] Speaker_A | I'm afraid I'm with Steph .
[06:54] Speaker_A | And I think your pen's running out of whatever .
"[06:59] Speaker_A | But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . He's hiding ."
[07:11] Speaker_A | Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best .
[07:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:34] Speaker_A | Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item ."
"[08:23] Speaker_A | Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ?"
[08:47] Speaker_A | Mark-up ?
[08:48] Speaker_D | B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
"[08:51] Speaker_D | But um let me I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent ."
[08:52] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:58] Speaker_D | And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?
"[09:00] Speaker_A | Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that ."
[09:10] Speaker_D | At twenty five .
[09:14] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:19] Speaker_A | To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking .
[09:21] Speaker_D | So that's four million of them ?
[09:23] Speaker_A | Something like that ?
[09:26] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:38] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:40] Speaker_A | That's a lot of selling .
[09:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:46] Speaker_D | Four million .
"[09:47] Speaker_A | To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million ."
[09:52] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[09:53] Speaker_A | Okay ?
[09:55] Speaker_A | Right .
"[10:02] Speaker_A | Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? You're both nodding , all three ."
[10:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[10:18] Speaker_A | I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another ."
"[10:31] Speaker_C | It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television ."
[10:39] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:42] Speaker_D | Y yeah .
[10:43] Speaker_A | And they don't always talk to each other .
[10:47] Speaker_A | Don't know .
[10:49] Speaker_A | Okay . Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ?
[11:00] Speaker_A | We have to think about that one .
[11:03] Speaker_D | We could make a Hello Kitty
[11:05] Speaker_D | themed remote .
[11:10] Speaker_D | Yeah . We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . Electrical their industrial design is very good .
[11:25] Speaker_C | I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has
"[11:34] Speaker_C | well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,"
[11:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:40] Speaker_C | you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like ."
"[11:46] Speaker_D | Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down ."
[11:48] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:07] Speaker_C | Mm .
[12:09] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[12:11] Speaker_D | Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus ."
"[12:23] Speaker_C | Ooh , closing the meeting ."
"[12:25] Speaker_A | Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the"
[12:26] Speaker_C | That was quick .
"[12:34] Speaker_A | I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ?"
[12:36] Speaker_B | Mm .
[12:38] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[13:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[13:24] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[13:25] Speaker_A | Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Thank you all ."
[13:39] Speaker_D | Okay .
[13:39] Speaker_B | 'Kay .

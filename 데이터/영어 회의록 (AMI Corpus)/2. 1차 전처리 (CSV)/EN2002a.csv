[00:00] Speaker_D | Funky sh stuff like that .
[00:00] Speaker_A | Wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings . Yeah .
"[00:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , exactly , yeah yeah yeah ."
"[00:15] Speaker_C | Well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing , how far they've got . Well I hope so ."
[00:21] Speaker_A | Not a lot . No .
[00:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[00:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[00:32] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[00:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[00:48] Speaker_B | Okay . Sorry . Yeah .
[00:48] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[00:50] Speaker_C | So yeah . We've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics . And then when you go on the menu , you can select a summarisation box , which pops up , and an audio player ."
[01:08] Speaker_D | Right .
"[01:08] Speaker_C | Um and a s I think the search works as well , so you could pop up a search . And it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start , you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that ."
[01:26] Speaker_C | Does that make sense ?
"[01:28] Speaker_C | Um the transcription box has got a summarise but button , which doesn't do anything yet . Um now I wonder wh how we wanna do , you know , we want a pop-up window with the speaker characterisation ."
"[01:46] Speaker_C | Um either we could do that you know , when does the pop-up come ? Either we can when you click on the the I_D_ , any sort of I_D_ in the transcription box , or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box , but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is . The problem is the r the left-click is already used because it highlights that um"
[01:46] Speaker_D | D yeah .
[01:46] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[02:16] Speaker_C | that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying , you know , the the left-click highlights it . So that you can I don't know what happens when you double-click actually , but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left-click for one thing and double-click for something else . Um I think so yeah , when you left-click it , you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there , I think ."
[02:18] Speaker_D | The l the left-click or the right-click .
[02:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:22] Speaker_D | Right .
"[02:32] Speaker_B | Yeah , I don't know ."
[02:42] Speaker_C | Um so we can't put it on left-click . We could put it on a right-click . We could for example have a little menu that pops up .
"[02:49] Speaker_D | Yeah , it might be quite good , I suppose . Yeah ."
"[02:50] Speaker_C | So right-click on at menu , you know , and you can click on speaker characterisation , up pops the window ."
[02:56] Speaker_D | What else could we have in the menu ?
"[03:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , but um I don't know about you , but uh usually in Windows right-click doesn't do anything , does it ? It opens a menu . Yeah , so yeah . So but that'd be yeah . If you just yeah ."
[03:10] Speaker_D | Is a window .
[03:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[03:23] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[03:24] Speaker_C | Um or just , you know , or just the button ."
[03:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[03:27] Speaker_B | I guess a button button makes a bit more sense , 'cause otherwise you don't really know that , oh , what if I right-click now , what happens then ? It's like more if it's visual . Yeah ."
[03:38] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[03:43] Speaker_C | Well oh , yeah . It's more obvious , isn't it , w what you can do . Yeah . Yeah , that's right . That's true , yeah , it's more intuitive really , isn't it ?"
"[03:51] Speaker_B | But well , we we can have both , but whatever ."
[03:54] Speaker_D | Add more buttons .
[04:21] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[04:23] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[04:27] Speaker_D | I guess so . So what did you part of the m the menu that comes down , it says give me all your meetings or something ."
[04:40] Speaker_D | Yep .
[04:44] Speaker_C | Or is that too much I mean ?
"[04:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , um I don't I mean it w it's more like part of the"
"[04:51] Speaker_B | browsing sort of thingy . More than the speaker characterisation , as m Steve mentioned . Um , I don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing ."
"[04:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah ."
[04:58] Speaker_A | Hmm . Yeah .
"[05:03] Speaker_A | Yeah , but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well . I mean speaker characterisation tied into I don't know . Di Just some way to sort of leverage that information . Like we have it , we're doing it , but what how does it help the browsing ? Or what can it give us in the browsing ? Yeah . Yeah ."
"[05:16] Speaker_C | Or you mean the the speaker characterisation ? Oh well , yeah , I mean ,"
[05:25] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[05:32] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah .
[05:33] Speaker_A | Right .
"[05:35] Speaker_B | Yeah . I mean I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like , well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic , and then if you , I don't know , click on that topic , you get everything that's in that topic or whatever . And in that way but I don't know ."
"[05:54] Speaker_C | Yeah , I mean that's that's still another level further . I mean we're not even there yet . You know , it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet . Y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user ."
[05:58] Speaker_B | No no no . Yeah .
[05:59] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
"[06:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . True , yeah ."
[06:14] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright . Why not .
[06:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[06:16] Speaker_A | Is that just from the main main window ? Is that is that from any particular window , like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something , have a right-click from for these various things to yeah ."
[06:17] Speaker_C | Sorry ?
[06:18] Speaker_D | Even if only one thing comes up .
"[06:37] Speaker_A | Right , yeah . Yep ."
[06:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[06:42] Speaker_A | Okay , yeah ."
"[06:44] Speaker_A | Now it's consistent throughout . So , yeah ."
[06:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:46] Speaker_D | On the t speaker .
[06:49] Speaker_C | So yeah . So we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations . And when then we have the interlinking by right-click basically .
[06:50] Speaker_D | And then this lot is on th
[07:04] Speaker_A | Right .
"[07:06] Speaker_A | Actually yeah , like um another common thing , like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double-click and it goes to a default thing on the menu , I mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen . If you double-click on a particular topic or something , then it goes to sort of a like a default view , so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic , either whatever we decide the default to be , whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting , and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting . Like I'm just thinking to have the default there , so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen , so the double-click will do that and so save them the trouble of right-clicking and choosing the item on the menu ."
[07:20] Speaker_C | Oh .
[07:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:46] Speaker_A | Well , it might come to us as we start playing with it ."
[07:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:51] Speaker_A | Um like we have the the right-click menu . You'll have the menu , right-click it , but instead of like have a default double-click , so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah , exactly . Yeah ."
[07:51] Speaker_B | Uh just let th
[07:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[07:58] Speaker_D | Oh , so and it figures out what's the most common use to double-click . Oh . Okay ."
[07:58] Speaker_B | Yep .
[08:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:03] Speaker_B | Like , I don't know , show the speaker characterisation for instance . Or just I don't know ."
[08:06] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[08:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again . And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is , you know what I mean ?"
[08:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:11] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[08:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
"[08:16] Speaker_B | But if you do double-click on something , don't you expect something to happen then ?"
[08:21] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[08:23] Speaker_B | Sort of well , I don't know ."
"[08:24] Speaker_D | Sometimes you do it by accident though . You , oh go away . Stop coming up . Yeah . No . Yeah , yeah , oh yeah . T throw stuff throwing out the window ."
[08:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:46] Speaker_D | Yep .
[08:57] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[08:58] Speaker_C | Sorry .
"[09:06] Speaker_B | Yeah , what you're clicking on . Obviously ."
"[09:08] Speaker_C | Sorry . Um yeah , another thing . Single audio files . Do we wanna use them or not ?"
[09:09] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[09:18] Speaker_D | We don't know yet do we , I don't think . Do you mean the single channel ?"
[09:21] Speaker_B | Single channel .
[09:22] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[09:25] Speaker_D | Probably not , but we might need them for disfluencies , if we try do it in audio . But at the moment , no . But yeah ."
[09:26] Speaker_B | No .
"[09:29] Speaker_A | Well , yeah ."
"[09:37] Speaker_D | We might want to be able to say oh , just give me what that person's saying ."
[09:41] Speaker_C | Do you though ? I mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you ? Does it ?
[09:41] Speaker_B | No .
[09:45] Speaker_D | Unless um you can't hear it properly or something . Somebody's talking over somebody else or something . Well p
"[09:50] Speaker_D | W we just say no for now and put it in later or something . Yeah , yeah ."
"[09:52] Speaker_C | No , hmm . Yeah ."
[09:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[09:56] Speaker_D | Yeah , 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot , won't it ? Therefore print will be bigger ."
[10:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[10:04] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[10:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned ? Do you think do you think it's really that bad ?"
[10:25] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[10:26] Speaker_A | Although the thing is typically though , is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time , probably not . Probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at , like dialogue acts , to whatever , characterisations ."
"[10:30] Speaker_C | Probably not , no . Yeah . Two or three maybe , but yeah . But yeah , it depends , I mean I I really wanna put the summary in somewhere , you know . And the summary for example is typical . You open the window , you read through it , you might click on you know , close it again straight-away . But it'd be good to have it there ."
[10:39] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[10:46] Speaker_D | Yeah . No , I think it's I think it's fine . Yeah . I think what we're doing is fine ."
"[10:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , true ."
[10:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:48] Speaker_B | But uh well , couldn't we I mean you probably I don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time ."
[10:57] Speaker_B | So maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary .
[11:01] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[11:03] Speaker_A | So like have a tab there ? For something like that choose on choose one .
"[11:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , tabs are good . Mozilla style . Yeah ."
[11:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:10] Speaker_C | That true . Yea yeah yeah yeah . That's right . I'm not sure yeah .
[11:16] Speaker_C | No . I don't know . Do you reckon ? I'm sure . I'm sure you could do anything .
[11:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:22] Speaker_D | If you really knew what you're doing . But I don't know . It's a bit of a cripple with Java's windowing tool-kit . The eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple .
[11:29] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[11:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:31] Speaker_C | I can have a look .
[11:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[11:34] Speaker_B | Yeah . Or just , I don't know . Yeah , uh change the contents of the same window , like from transcription to summary ."
"[11:36] Speaker_C | But yeah , that that might be an idea , yeah ."
[11:41] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah .
[11:44] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[11:44] Speaker_B | Probably yeah .
[11:46] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[11:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , or even just have buttons on it , toggle buttons or something on the tool-bar for that window ."
[11:53] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[11:54] Speaker_A | Just something .
"[11:56] Speaker_A | A lot of different ways we can do it , it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever . Just gonna be yeah . Yeah ."
"[11:59] Speaker_B | No , no , it could be like transcription summary , like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want ."
[12:01] Speaker_A | Yeah . Exactly .
[12:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:05] Speaker_A | Or check-marks . Even have two of 'em checked and send Yeah . Yeah .
[12:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , exactly . Yeah ."
[12:19] Speaker_B | Yeah . I don't like pop-ups .
"[12:20] Speaker_C | But I mean people get used to it , I mean when you use a Windows or Linux for that matter , you have a lot of windows open . And you manage them ."
[12:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[12:27] Speaker_D | You do , yeah ? Yeah ."
[12:27] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[12:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[12:31] Speaker_A | True .
"[12:32] Speaker_D | Yeah . Unless , can you I don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that Can you can you do that ? Okay , well it's alright then . Yeah . Of course you can actually , yeah , it's got everything ."
[12:33] Speaker_B | I guess that yeah .
"[12:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , you can minimise 'em . Yeah , yeah ."
"[12:41] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , like a lot of these can be , like once we get the disfluencies out , then we can you know , have transcript without the disfluency , transcript with the disfluent disfluency . Have all these , you know , have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct , yeah . Exclusive , yeah ."
[12:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , they're definitely gonna be in the same window , yeah ."
[12:57] Speaker_B | He's close .
"[12:58] Speaker_C | Exclusive . Yeah , that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway . So d"
[13:01] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:04] Speaker_C | Yeah , do you wanna do that with summaries in ? Put the summaries in in the same window ."
"[13:10] Speaker_B | Yeah , um well could uh I don't know . Would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then . Like full meeting , meeting without disfluencies , and summarise ."
[13:15] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[13:20] Speaker_A | Right .
"[13:23] Speaker_C | Summary . Yeah , you wanna do that ? Yeah ."
"[13:24] Speaker_A | Yeah , that kinda makes sense ."
[13:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , sounds good ."
[13:30] Speaker_B | Um yeah .
[13:36] Speaker_C | And finally the prototype he spoke about . What kind of prototype could we produce ?
[13:43] Speaker_A | By the end of February .
"[13:44] Speaker_C | Because I'm I'm just , you know , I go into the lab and I say right , what am I gonna change today . You know ? And it kind of just it just develops , I'm not aiming for anything . Do we wanna aim for something ?"
"[14:01] Speaker_C | I'm I'm pretty much getting there anyway , to be honest . It's not it's not gonna be a lot more work ."
[14:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:06] Speaker_B | I guess it is . I mean just to try it and I mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah . Yeah .
[14:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .
"[14:14] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's what we need , yeah . Something just slightly more than just that on its own . Yep ."
[14:16] Speaker_C | Oh .
[14:18] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[14:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo
[14:25] Speaker_C | Mm true .
"[14:25] Speaker_D | Yep , definitely ."
[14:28] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[14:28] Speaker_B | So I guess that's what we need to aim for .
"[14:30] Speaker_D | I think that's kinda as well , isn't it really ? Seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be"
[14:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[14:36] Speaker_C | Oh right , I see . Hmm ."
[14:37] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[14:38] Speaker_D | a prototype with a GUI .
"[14:39] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well if I guess I mean that was probably our intention , but we might not have written it down . So I guess I know ."
[14:47] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[14:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[15:04] Speaker_D | You can make it if you make it world readable , then anybody can access it ."
[15:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , sure . I don't know if it's readable at the moment , but you can sure have a d have a look ."
[15:13] Speaker_A | That might be might be an idea .
"[15:16] Speaker_D | No , uh i i it no , they're not world-readable . It not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default . You can see them but you can't read them ."
[15:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:20] Speaker_B | Alright .
[15:22] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
[15:23] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[15:25] Speaker_A | Okay , alright ."
[15:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[15:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:32] Speaker_A | Or you could just email to us . Okay , yeah , yeah , okay , right . Yeah , right , okay ."
"[15:34] Speaker_C | Well , this is not difficult . It's in all the emails . Not O_ four . O_ four , five five five ,"
[15:36] Speaker_D | What's your number ?
[15:43] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:48] Speaker_C | six O_ .
"[15:49] Speaker_B | Say that again , O_ four ."
[15:50] Speaker_C | O_ four five five five six O_ .
"[15:54] Speaker_C | And then um there's a folder um N_L_S_S_D_ ,"
[15:58] Speaker_D | N_L_S_S_D_ .
[15:59] Speaker_C | and it's called the M_ browser .
"[16:02] Speaker_D | The M_ browser , for meeting ."
[16:07] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:09] Speaker_C | Really . No , I'm I'm extremely organised , you see . I've got folders for everything . I love folders ."
[16:15] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[16:21] Speaker_B | Mm .
[16:24] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[16:26] Speaker_C | Yep , so that's me done . Someone else wanna talk about their stuff ?"
[16:26] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[16:39] Speaker_B | Oh um I don't know . I basi I s started like browsing a bit , just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just"
[16:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[16:52] Speaker_A | Um all the searching stuff . Like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that . Hmm .
"[16:54] Speaker_C | The search , okay ."
[16:58] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[17:02] Speaker_A | Yeah . So you could probably just use that code , like that was behind the question she asked him earlier . Just You know , the re-using code and stuff was just like okay , good ."
[17:04] Speaker_C | Indexing .
[17:07] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[17:08] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[17:10] Speaker_C | Oh right . Oh that's pretty much there , is it ?"
[17:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:10] Speaker_D | Oh you found some code for it . For the inde
"[17:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , well I don't know if it's usable . I uh can have a look th at it . But but I found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing . Uh whatever . Yeah ."
[17:15] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
[17:15] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[17:19] Speaker_D | Alright . Cool , cool . So even if it doesn't work , you can jiggery pokery around and make it work . Y yeah ."
[17:20] Speaker_C | Oh great .
[17:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:24] Speaker_A | Yeah , probably . We'll probably still have to do some other file manage while , I don't know , creation . Messing around still , though . Yeah ."
"[17:24] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[17:28] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah . All sorts of nonsense . But yeah . By the basics is uh oh okay , that's good ."
[17:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:33] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's handy ."
"[17:34] Speaker_B | Um yeah , I guess that's it ."
[17:36] Speaker_C | So you think it shouldn't be too difficult ?
[17:39] Speaker_B | I don't know . Uh I'm I was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files . I mean uh how much do we actually need to do . Like extracting things from the X_M_L_ files and stuff to be able to do the indexing ?
[17:56] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[17:57] Speaker_C | Oh , I see . Yeah . You have to convert it to some sort of format , I suppose ."
[17:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:03] Speaker_D | I've been trying to g write something to read the X_M_L_ and get rid of it . And I can get rid of it , but I'm having trouble putting it anywhere else . So it will come up on the screen For the moment I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java to play with it . But I guess it's not very difficult . Yeah , in Java , yeah ."
[18:12] Speaker_A | Huh ? Okay . Right .
"[18:19] Speaker_B | Okay . What are you writing in Java or yeah , okay . Yeah ."
[18:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
[18:23] Speaker_A | Right .
[18:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:26] Speaker_C | I mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then , because um , you know , they already extract for example transcripts . Put it into a window at least ."
"[18:34] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah , I'm sure they do . Yeah ."
"[18:38] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's good idea ."
[19:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah . Absolutely , yeah ."
[19:08] Speaker_D | Should share as much as possible .
[19:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:13] Speaker_B | Yeah . Should we , I don't know ,"
[19:13] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[19:18] Speaker_B | meet up and see what we could do ? I mean , I don't know , see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe ? Or what do we need . Yeah . Yeah ."
[19:24] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[19:24] Speaker_A | Right . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , exactly , exactly . So you're still working ? I see ."
"[19:27] Speaker_D | Next week sometime , yeah . I actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic . But well , whatever it was , last week then . The the the week as it as is rather than the proper week , do you know what I mean . Do you know that , it's been all a bit manic , the last m the last yeah ."
"[19:33] Speaker_A | Yes , exactly , same . Yeah , I mean betwe um I sup yeah . Yeah ."
[19:44] Speaker_A | Right .
"[19:45] Speaker_A | Well well you're in S_P_N_L_P_ and S_P_ two , right ? So yeah . Yeah , that's where I'm at ."
"[19:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's right , yeah . And then we had to do an I_R_P_ , whatever it was last week as well . Which is only a page long , but it's quite difficult to write a page ."
[19:48] Speaker_B | Yep .
[19:53] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[19:56] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , oh yeah ."
[19:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Oh that's complete rubbish anyway . Never mind . Just so stupid .
[20:09] Speaker_A | Oh yeah .
"[20:10] Speaker_A | Okay . So . Yeah , I was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um , yeah , hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the GUI . Okay . Think that should be possible ."
"[20:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , we're gonna meet up ."
[20:16] Speaker_D | Yep .
[20:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[20:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[20:24] Speaker_C | Well ye the browser as I use it now or as uh , you know , it was there when I took it um uses the um the N_X_T_ search to get the data out of the out the files , which I think is odd , but I'm not quite sure how it works yet . I don't quite understand it ."
[20:36] Speaker_A | Okay . Why ?
"[20:47] Speaker_C | To get the data i for example to get the summarisation data , you have to search for I think the I_D_s or something . Yeah ."
"[20:56] Speaker_D | That's pretty bizarre , isn't it ? Well I guess that's how it works . They've got d"
[20:57] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:01] Speaker_D | That is pretty bizarre .
"[21:03] Speaker_C | So they don't , you know , they don't say look in that and that folder , but they say search everything ."
[21:10] Speaker_D | That is pretty bizarre .
"[21:29] Speaker_C | No , this is not the actual search . This is just when you open what you know , to load the transcript for example , to find the transcript for a certain meeting , it does does an N_X_T_ search for the string , I don't know , transcript or text or whatever ."
[21:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
[21:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[21:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , so I don't know if you've looked at the search query s language , but it's like a dollar A_ text say ."
"[21:59] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , yeah , 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable , doesn't it , and then they keep Okay ."
[21:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:03] Speaker_C | Yeah . And then yeah . Because every every of all of these um
"[22:11] Speaker_C | these files have got um tha an I_D_ . And all the transcript files have got the string , I don't know what it is , words or text or something in it , so it just searches for those files ."
[22:22] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:23] Speaker_C | Vaguely .
[22:29] Speaker_C | Open .
"[22:37] Speaker_C | Um um well , it's in the code . Just that it , you know , it yeah , you define a search object , and then you search on that string . I had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary . That's how I"
[22:41] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[22:51] Speaker_C | I had to I had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself .
"[22:56] Speaker_D | So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it , is that what you did ?"
"[22:59] Speaker_C | Yeah , just search for a specific string ."
[23:03] Speaker_D | Right .
"[23:05] Speaker_C | So you could just , you know , you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere . Yeah ."
[23:05] Speaker_D | Okeydoke .
"[23:11] Speaker_D | Fish the data , I was just thinking that , yeah ."
[23:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:16] Speaker_C | If you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna , you know , whatever you wanna do , then just send me an email ."
[23:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
[23:26] Speaker_C | I can explain it .
[23:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:30] Speaker_C | Oh yeah . Actually , in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that I used from this from you know , that they gave us , had a lot of extra stuff in , and I haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions I haven't you know , that I don't need . Yeah , just in case . Exactly . Yes . So they're all in there ye still . A lot of rubbish , but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end , I think ."
[23:44] Speaker_D | Just in case . mission critical . Yeah .
"[23:44] Speaker_A | Hmm , right , right ."
"[23:59] Speaker_C | Yes . Exactly , yes . Yeah . Precisely ."
[23:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . M yeah . Yeah .
[24:04] Speaker_B | Oh yeah .
[24:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:08] Speaker_B | Oh no .
[24:08] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[24:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:12] Speaker_D | So basically we go and go and do some work really , I think that's the um the um the answer to that , isn't it . The long and the short of it ."
[24:18] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well f
[24:20] Speaker_A | Uh Um Yeah . Yeah . How many hours is this ? Hmm .
[24:27] Speaker_C | I don't actually have that much to do at the moment .
[24:40] Speaker_A | Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . That's what I gotta work on .
[24:48] Speaker_A | Mm .
[24:53] Speaker_C | No .
[24:55] Speaker_A | Who was doing that ?
"[24:59] Speaker_C | You do . Well , I'll do that then ."
[25:00] Speaker_A | Damn .
"[25:02] Speaker_A | These can be changed as well . Okay , yeah . Um I don't know , it doesn't matter . If if you want to . I mean it's just , you know , play around with some extra stuff . You have some time , why not ."
[25:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:18] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's nice .
[25:27] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[25:30] Speaker_A | Was that in informatics course ? Or Oh . Oh , it like digital , okay . Okay ."
"[25:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something . Yeah ."
[25:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:37] Speaker_D | Oh , so it's uh , yeah ."
"[25:38] Speaker_C | And then then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems , which we had one exercise as well , and that's in like Friday ."
[25:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:44] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[25:53] Speaker_A | Alright . Yeah .
[25:58] Speaker_A | Fine . Hmm .
[26:04] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[26:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well I don't know , is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss ?"
[26:11] Speaker_B | No .
[26:14] Speaker_B | I don
[26:16] Speaker_A | Did we wanna meet before we talk to Steve next week .
[26:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , if you like . We can always decide then , I mean yeah . Yeah . Um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then ?"
"[26:33] Speaker_B | Yeah , I don't know. ."
"[26:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well we can decide . Yeah , exactly . True . Yeah ."
[26:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:40] Speaker_A | Search . And well sure , why not . Couldn't be that hard . Well , it'll be , you know , still limited version of , you know , the next query search . But , no no . Won't be the whole thing then . Um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do . Hmm . yeah . Well , actually most are just dialogue acts . And what else was there ."
[26:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:56] Speaker_B | No .
[27:00] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:13] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:19] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[27:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[27:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , it'll get behind schedule , yeah , pretty quick . Like you're saying , yeah . Well actually , do we wanna set a date for interim prototype ?"
[27:36] Speaker_A | Specifically a date ?
[27:47] Speaker_B | The progress report is due on twenty third February . February .
[27:54] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[27:55] Speaker_D | So so what's that , two weeks basically ."
[27:57] Speaker_B | Um yeah .
[28:02] Speaker_D | Ish yeah .
"[28:04] Speaker_C | Then we can write about it in the in the interim report , and s you know , and then we've got something to show ."
[28:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[28:19] Speaker_B | Just looking at my own deadlines . See . Yeah , that would be fine . ."
"[28:30] Speaker_C | Maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for . And then if you want , you can give that to me and I'll I'll build a u nice , you know , a few tick-boxes and drop-down menus ."
[28:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[28:44] Speaker_B | Wasn't like what you had now , wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on ? Or was it just like that one ."
[28:48] Speaker_C | No .
"[28:50] Speaker_C | Oh that's that's that doesn't exist . Tha that's completely cut and pasted . That does not exist . Nicely done though , isn't it ? It's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know , all these drop-down menus and tick-boxes are nicked from Google online . A screen-shot of Google ."
[29:15] Speaker_B | Oh mm .
"[29:36] Speaker_D | No , it's not , is it ? Yeah ."
"[29:36] Speaker_A | Right , true . Mm decide on that on over the weekend ."
"[29:39] Speaker_C | Yeah , do you wanna , you know , just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do , and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include ?"
[29:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:51] Speaker_A | Right .
[29:51] Speaker_C | That would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do .
"[29:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , totally ."
[29:56] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:58] Speaker_B | It would be nice to , I don't know , meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already , so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff ."
"[30:10] Speaker_A | Oh , just like the basic . So like no . Sorry ?"
[30:12] Speaker_C | Know already what ?
[30:16] Speaker_C | Oh .
"[30:16] Speaker_A | Yeah . Just like all the and seeing the code , and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done . Like just get a a quick look over and just the basics . Yeah . Or like like , you know , the class paths all that sort of thing . Like just just say okay , well here's you know , everything's basic in set-up and then just yeah , just jump right in ."
[30:23] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:29] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , I can do that ."
[30:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:44] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I know . Well thing is , you know , if yeah , something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah , like my schedule's like a class , break , class , break , class , you know , that sort of thing . So so yeah , I know , exactly , exactly , that's what I'm thinking . So something like that and then if I have a class I can run off and do whatever . Yeah . Okay ."
"[30:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it , you know ."
"[30:58] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah yeah ."
[31:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:02] Speaker_C | Pick a time . I I you know , let me know , whenever ."

"[31:10] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
[31:13] Speaker_D | Mm Monday afternoon .
[31:20] Speaker_C | Three o'clock . Actually th yeah .
[31:21] Speaker_A | Sure .
[31:24] Speaker_A | Possibly .
[31:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:28] Speaker_B | It's full , yeah ."
[31:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's an option too . Yeah , after ."
[31:33] Speaker_C | D_ and A_ .
[31:35] Speaker_A | Sure . That's fine .
[31:35] Speaker_D | Three's good though . I'll but we have s whatever . What's you what would you prefer ?
[31:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . Or three thirty . No , just yeah . That'd be necessarily necessarily short ."
"[31:43] Speaker_B | Well , it doesn't matter for me . I mean three three or after what ?"
[31:43] Speaker_C | That's gonna be tight .
"[31:44] Speaker_D | We could three thirty in the in the computer room in here , and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door ? Oh , you haven't got a key , do you ? Can none of you get in there ?"
[31:47] Speaker_A | Actually we can't get in there though .
[31:50] Speaker_B | Maybe we ca
[31:52] Speaker_A | W we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door . Yeah .
"[31:53] Speaker_C | Yeah , it what front door ?"
"[31:55] Speaker_D | The k the f there's computer rooms in here , the M_S_C_ computer lab and uh is in here . Well if you find me , I'll show you where I'll I'll let us all in there , and we can all go in there . Yeah , yeah . You do need to have a key for it . Like that's the thing . It's got a lock door button ."
[31:56] Speaker_B | In four Buccleuch .
"[32:00] Speaker_A | How about if we take uh a tour ? Yeah , right . Yeah , yeah , exactly ."
"[32:09] Speaker_A | Okay . Just sort bang on it . Actually I was asking Steve about that , whether we can get in there . Whether he was gonna get us access into the"
[32:09] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[32:12] Speaker_D | Yeah , somebody will answer it ."
[32:18] Speaker_B | Into what ? Okay uh .
[32:18] Speaker_A | the computer room .
"[32:20] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's only got it's crap , it's only got about four or five computers in But it would do quite good for our job , 'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often ."
[32:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
[32:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:27] Speaker_A | Right . Is there a printer in there too ?
[32:32] Speaker_C | Really ?
"[32:33] Speaker_A | A nice okay . That would come in handy , yeah ."
[32:34] Speaker_C | Really ?
"[32:37] Speaker_B | Oh , is that the photo-copier I heard I heard about ? Yeah ."
[32:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:45] Speaker_B | So what time do we say ?
[32:48] Speaker_C | I just think it's better to do it afterwards . Then we have all the time we need . Rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out .
"[32:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true . So after D_N_L_G_ . Yeah ."
[32:50] Speaker_D | Oh right .
"[32:51] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
"[32:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[32:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . Hmm ."
[32:58] Speaker_A | As long as D_N_L_G_ doesn't go late .
[33:08] Speaker_B | What ?
[33:08] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[33:14] Speaker_B | Yeah , I don't know . It's reading week next . It should be it shouldn't be any well , it's supposed to be next week . It's week six next week ."
[33:17] Speaker_C | Is it really ?
[33:18] Speaker_A | Are you ? Next week ? Or the week ? How ?
[33:22] Speaker_C | Really ?
[33:23] Speaker_A | Oh .
[33:26] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's cancelled ?
[33:29] Speaker_A | Oh really ?
"[33:32] Speaker_C | Yeah , I don't think there is an official I don't think there was an official one last semester . I think it was just a bank holiday , wasn't it ?"
[33:32] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[33:38] Speaker_A | Um something like that . I think one or couple classes were cancelled .
"[33:40] Speaker_B | No , I think it w"
[33:43] Speaker_A | Yeah . Exact Yeah . I th
"[33:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , which are a bit crap , yeah . I think the under-graduates had uh all were off totally ."
[33:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[33:49] Speaker_A | I think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not . Well , I don't feel like teaching . Yeah , okay . I think yeah . I think D_I_L_ will probably have one to make up for missing classes . D_I_L_ will probably have classes , yeah ."
"[33:54] Speaker_D | Nah , make 'em work ."
[34:00] Speaker_B | What ?
"[34:02] Speaker_B | Yeah , th we will probably have it , yeah yeah . last week . Yeah ."
[34:07] Speaker_C | Okay . Let's meet Monday .
[34:08] Speaker_A | Yep .
[34:10] Speaker_D | Done .
"[34:10] Speaker_B | Yeah , um I guess that's it . Was there anything else ? Do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should I take care of it ?"
[34:13] Speaker_C | Hmm ?
[34:22] Speaker_B | Yeah . I don't know if there was something . Oh I think he basically said
"[34:29] Speaker_B | um the same things as in the comments , if I could read it ."
[34:44] Speaker_A | Do you really want multiple windows from a single lap ?
[34:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:49] Speaker_A | But most will probably want to go with defaults .
"[34:54] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well , uh that was , I guess ."
[34:54] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . You'd be s
"[34:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , exactly , and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation ."
[34:58] Speaker_B | Oh .
[35:05] Speaker_B | No .
"[35:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah that's about it . Nothing terribly exciting ."
[35:07] Speaker_B | Oh yeah . Yeah ? And now we have seven percent of the course already done ? Is quite good . So if y
[35:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[35:16] Speaker_C | Right . I think we need to tick the okay box , right ?"
[35:21] Speaker_D | Oof . Bu buzzes . Yeah .
[35:25] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah .
[35:26] Speaker_B | Who ? Yeah . .
[35:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
[35:31] Speaker_C | Should we turn these off then or what ?

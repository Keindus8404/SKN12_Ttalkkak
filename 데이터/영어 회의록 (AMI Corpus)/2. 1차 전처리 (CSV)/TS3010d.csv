[03:07] Speaker_D | Okay . That's uh um That can be none .
"[03:24] Speaker_D | Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up ."
[03:37] Speaker_D | Uh-oh . Okay .
"[03:41] Speaker_D | Um , yeah . Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences ."
"[03:58] Speaker_D | Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document ."
[04:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[04:37] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document"
[04:47] Speaker_A | Criteria .
"[04:59] Speaker_D | Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can"
[05:08] Speaker_D | get a number in here .
[05:14] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[05:15] Speaker_A | No , it's okay ."
"[05:16] Speaker_D | Well , uh we can't do that ."
[05:17] Speaker_C | I'll get it .
"[05:18] Speaker_A | Oh , it's okay ."
"[05:19] Speaker_D | Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative ."
"[05:30] Speaker_D | Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together ."
"[05:34] Speaker_D | And in the end , we will c uh count an average"
[05:38] Speaker_D | of all rating . The first uh on each item .
[05:43] Speaker_A | What do you think ?
"[05:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ ."
"[05:55] Speaker_D | So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . Hmm ."
[06:04] Speaker_C | I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
"[06:10] Speaker_C | What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an"
"[06:22] Speaker_C | seven . Si six six . Sorry , six ."
[06:23] Speaker_D | So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . And you true or false . And true is one .

"[06:52] Speaker_D | So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers ."
"[06:59] Speaker_D | Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that ."
[07:15] Speaker_D | That's uh a six .
[07:18] Speaker_C | Five .
"[07:21] Speaker_B | Mm , four ."
"[07:23] Speaker_A | Yes , it's for the"
[07:25] Speaker_A | younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
[07:31] Speaker_A | So I think it's four .
"[07:33] Speaker_B | Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So I mean , the colours are for young people , but"
[07:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[07:38] Speaker_A | No .
"[07:41] Speaker_A | Yes . So , I think it's four ."
[07:44] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:50] Speaker_A | Okay . Give it a four . Yep .
[07:51] Speaker_C | Four .
"[07:52] Speaker_D | Four . Uh , okay . Mm ."
[07:59] Speaker_A | We put the fashion in electronics .
[08:01] Speaker_D | That's uh the motto of our company .
"[08:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?"
"[08:13] Speaker_D | I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two ."
"[08:27] Speaker_C | Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh"
"[08:32] Speaker_C | techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two ."
[08:40] Speaker_B | Yes . Two .
[08:42] Speaker_D | Two .
"[08:42] Speaker_A | Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new ."
[08:48] Speaker_A | It must be a fashion .
[08:50] Speaker_A | But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion
[08:51] Speaker_C | It it will be fashion .
"[08:58] Speaker_A | we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five ."
[09:09] Speaker_D | Uh Okay .
[09:12] Speaker_B | Then make it th three .
"[09:12] Speaker_D | Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ?"
[09:14] Speaker_C | 'Kay . Three is okay .
[09:25] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:25] Speaker_D | Yeah okay .
"[09:29] Speaker_D | The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five ."
"[09:52] Speaker_B | Yes , a one . I like it ."
[10:03] Speaker_D | We have to do our uh Two or three ? Two . Okay .
[10:05] Speaker_C | Say two . Two .
"[10:06] Speaker_A | Okay , two ."
"[10:12] Speaker_D | So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep ."
"[10:19] Speaker_D | Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average ."
"[10:33] Speaker_D | So , um that's why it's a negative in it ."
"[10:39] Speaker_D | Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers ."
"[10:55] Speaker_D | But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two ."
[11:03] Speaker_C | One .
[11:09] Speaker_A | Me too . One .
[11:11] Speaker_D | One .
"[11:21] Speaker_A | Next , six ."
[11:25] Speaker_A | It does not get lost easily .
"[11:30] Speaker_D | Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?"
"[11:41] Speaker_A | No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so ."
[11:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:54] Speaker_C | It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
[11:56] Speaker_A | No .
[11:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .

"[12:54] Speaker_D | Well , let's also give this a two . T"
"[12:57] Speaker_C | I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy trendy ."

"[13:32] Speaker_A | No , it's new . Innovation ."
"[13:52] Speaker_D | We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . I We'll go for a three ."
[13:55] Speaker_C | Oh .
[14:14] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[14:16] Speaker_C | But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two ."

"[17:20] Speaker_A | Interface , push-button ."
"[17:24] Speaker_A | Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_"
[17:35] Speaker_A | We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
[17:38] Speaker_C | One .
[17:39] Speaker_D | One .
[17:39] Speaker_A | And it's not really a s
[17:40] Speaker_C | Joystick uh thing .
"[17:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour ."

"[18:10] Speaker_A | Uh , no . It's too expensive ."
[18:13] Speaker_C | Yeah . Wh
"[18:15] Speaker_A | So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve ."
[18:16] Speaker_C | What what are the costs ?
[18:20] Speaker_C | Fifteen .
"[18:36] Speaker_A | We have rubber , special colour ."
[18:37] Speaker_D | We would have uh n
"[18:41] Speaker_C | A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour ."
[18:45] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
"[18:46] Speaker_C | Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?"
[18:55] Speaker_D | If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .
[19:01] Speaker_D | For up down left right .
"[19:01] Speaker_A | Um , then we uh lose"
[19:06] Speaker_A | two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much .
[19:14] Speaker_A | Exactly the special colours .
[19:28] Speaker_C | Um just only plastic or only rubber ?
[19:32] Speaker_A | That's one Euro .
[19:35] Speaker_C | One Euro discount .
"[19:39] Speaker_A | So , I don't think that's good ."
[19:51] Speaker_A | I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
"[19:59] Speaker_C | If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left ."
[20:06] Speaker_A | Yes .
[20:08] Speaker_A | Then it's
[20:12] Speaker_A | only thirteen Euros .
[20:19] Speaker_A | So uh yeah .
[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah . Then you have Or you have to cut this off .
[20:25] Speaker_C | Uh uh-uh .
"[20:30] Speaker_A | Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look ."
[20:32] Speaker_C | No .
[20:50] Speaker_A | Yellow rubber .
"[20:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , normal ."
"[20:54] Speaker_C | Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left ."
"[21:03] Speaker_C | And it's twelve Euros , I think ."

[21:32] Speaker_A | But if you lose the
"[21:35] Speaker_A | joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?"
[21:41] Speaker_A | Or it's then a regular ?
"[21:46] Speaker_C | Oh , wait wait wait ."

[21:53] Speaker_C | Oh yeah .
"[21:56] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah , yeah ."
[22:01] Speaker_A | And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
"[22:04] Speaker_C | If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ ."
[22:12] Speaker_A | Is it a good design ?
"[22:15] Speaker_C | Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have"
[22:23] Speaker_C | the L_C_D_ .
"[22:26] Speaker_C | So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date ."
"[22:29] Speaker_D | If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ?"
[22:35] Speaker_C | Yeah .

"[22:57] Speaker_A | Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit ."

[23:26] Speaker_A | you have to pay
[23:29] Speaker_A | point two Euros .

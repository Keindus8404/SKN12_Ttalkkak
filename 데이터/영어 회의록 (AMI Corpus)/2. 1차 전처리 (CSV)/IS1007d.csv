[00:48] Speaker_A | So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
[00:58] Speaker_A | for the remote control . So . So let's see the what
"[01:11] Speaker_B | Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ?"
[01:11] Speaker_A | did you prepare .
[01:16] Speaker_B | Mm the shared folder .
[01:16] Speaker_A | Sh share folder for th your presentation ?
[01:18] Speaker_B | Yes .
[01:20] Speaker_B | We have a presentation .
[01:32] Speaker_B | So I got the participant uh
[01:35] Speaker_B | three .
[01:36] Speaker_B | W uh .
[01:39] Speaker_B | Three .
"[01:41] Speaker_B | It's the final design , yeah ."
[01:44] Speaker_A | Okay just one .
[01:49] Speaker_B | S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
[01:51] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[01:53] Speaker_B | Right . And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module ."
[02:24] Speaker_B | And detachable big buttons for all people um .
[02:31] Speaker_B | So .
[02:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[02:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
[03:01] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[03:13] Speaker_A | Why you why you you put it in the the side ?
[03:21] Speaker_A | It's not a good place maybe .
[03:23] Speaker_B | No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up
[03:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:30] Speaker_B | the speeches from anywhere .
[03:31] Speaker_D | Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
"[03:34] Speaker_C | Well so it's a microphone array . No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off ."
"[03:37] Speaker_A | Oh it's very costly , microphone array ."
[03:37] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[03:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[03:50] Speaker_B | Mm .
[03:54] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
[03:55] Speaker_D | Okay .
[04:07] Speaker_C | And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
[04:12] Speaker_A | How much does it cost this one ?
"[04:14] Speaker_C | Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila ."
[04:21] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[04:22] Speaker_A | Fifteen dollars ?
[04:24] Speaker_A | Ah it's above it's above the budget .
[04:35] Speaker_D | The cost would be le reduced .
[04:37] Speaker_B | Mm .
[04:40] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[04:42] Speaker_A | How many b battery is there ?
"[04:45] Speaker_C | How many , excuse me ?"
[04:46] Speaker_A | Battery .
[04:51] Speaker_B | Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
[04:54] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[04:56] Speaker_C | Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger ."
[04:57] Speaker_B | Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem .
[05:01] Speaker_A | So one one battery ?
[05:04] Speaker_C | On uh yeah one battery .
[05:06] Speaker_D | Is that two or one ?
[05:09] Speaker_A | It's kinetic reserve .
[05:15] Speaker_D | Now what is the whole day rating for that ?
[05:18] Speaker_C | The excuse me ?
[05:18] Speaker_D | Whole day's rating .
[05:20] Speaker_D | What type of battery ?
[05:21] Speaker_C | Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist .
[05:25] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
"[05:27] Speaker_D | Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm ."
[05:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:32] Speaker_C | So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh"
[05:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:41] Speaker_B | Mm .
[05:48] Speaker_C | it works .
[05:52] Speaker_C | Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .
[06:10] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[06:10] Speaker_B | all in a single button . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ ."
"[06:28] Speaker_D | And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?"
[06:30] Speaker_C | Yep .
[06:33] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:35] Speaker_A | I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
[06:40] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:43] Speaker_A | getting destroyed . If you
[06:45] Speaker_B | Uh okay this is new prototype uh .
"[06:48] Speaker_C | So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . So basically th it's the same uh yeah . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user ."
[07:05] Speaker_D | Uh-huh and also the switch . Okay .
[07:26] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[07:26] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:46] Speaker_C | Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .
[07:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:51] Speaker_D | Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
[07:55] Speaker_B | W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
[07:57] Speaker_D | Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .
[07:59] Speaker_A | And we will we will serve the charger with this ?
[08:00] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:03] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah of course mm .
[08:04] Speaker_B | Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
[08:04] Speaker_A | With the remote control .
"[08:38] Speaker_B | Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design ."
"[08:46] Speaker_D | Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment ."
[08:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:51] Speaker_A | The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
[08:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[08:55] Speaker_A | And the price of
[08:56] Speaker_C | Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features .
"[09:00] Speaker_B | Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular ."
[09:18] Speaker_A | That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .
[09:23] Speaker_D | Something like customised . Yeah .
[09:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
[09:40] Speaker_D | Mm hmm hmm hmm .
[09:44] Speaker_D | Hmm okay .
[09:46] Speaker_B | It's pretty flexible in the yeah price .
[09:47] Speaker_C | You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
[09:52] Speaker_B | Uh yeah yeah you should present that .
[09:53] Speaker_D | And this is other one ?
"[09:53] Speaker_C | that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on ."
"[10:10] Speaker_C | H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works ."
[10:15] Speaker_D | Mm hmm hmm hmm .
[10:22] Speaker_B | Mm .
[10:27] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[10:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:36] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[10:43] Speaker_B | simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity ."
"[11:06] Speaker_B | So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material ."
[11:17] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[11:38] Speaker_A | Titanium .
[11:49] Speaker_D | Yeah that's fine .
"[12:04] Speaker_B | and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,"
[12:13] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[12:23] Speaker_B | And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children ."
[12:29] Speaker_D | Mm hmm hmm hmm .
[13:16] Speaker_A | Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ?
"[13:23] Speaker_C | For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device ."
[13:32] Speaker_A | With with with the charge ?
[13:34] Speaker_D | With the charger ?
[13:34] Speaker_C | The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
[13:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[13:44] Speaker_C | Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger ."
[13:52] Speaker_C | So if you uh sum up uh everything
"[13:55] Speaker_C | wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two ."
[14:08] Speaker_A | We don't have all the options .
[14:12] Speaker_A | Charger we don't have charger here either .
[14:19] Speaker_A | No it's
[14:20] Speaker_C | But it's just if you want all functionalities .
[14:22] Speaker_A | it's below the the the budget .
[14:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:25] Speaker_C | Excuse me ?
[14:26] Speaker_A | It's below the bu
[14:29] Speaker_D | Yeah it's a nice input but we have an
"[14:34] Speaker_D | other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu"
[14:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:44] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:45] Speaker_D | I think we can just go to my presentation then .
[14:49] Speaker_D | We can wind up .
[14:53] Speaker_D | Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .
"[15:07] Speaker_D | So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh"
"[15:16] Speaker_D | in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative ."
[15:40] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:46] Speaker_D | Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .
[15:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
"[16:12] Speaker_D | Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like ."
[16:32] Speaker_B | Spongy spongy .
[16:37] Speaker_B | Mm mm .
"[16:39] Speaker_D | So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy ."
[16:43] Speaker_B | Mm mm .
[16:58] Speaker_C | Okay .
[16:58] Speaker_B | But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ?
[17:05] Speaker_D | Um .
[17:06] Speaker_B | We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . Spongy .
"[17:11] Speaker_D | Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is"
"[17:24] Speaker_D | innovative , and third is easy to use ."
[17:38] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:39] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[17:49] Speaker_D | from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this ."
[17:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:57] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[17:58] Speaker_D | So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true ,"
[18:01] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[18:26] Speaker_D | No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ."
[18:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:32] Speaker_B | But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
[18:35] Speaker_A | You .
"[18:35] Speaker_D | According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?"
[18:42] Speaker_B | Mm .
[18:45] Speaker_D | Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ .
[18:51] Speaker_D | On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
[18:53] Speaker_B | Mm .
[18:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[19:01] Speaker_C | Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .
[19:06] Speaker_D | And you both agree for that ?
[19:08] Speaker_A | And you ?
[19:25] Speaker_C | Technical aspects .
[19:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[19:32] Speaker_D | So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
[19:33] Speaker_C | Yeah a three .
[19:38] Speaker_C | Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
[19:39] Speaker_D | Four .
[19:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:46] Speaker_C | removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
"[19:53] Speaker_D | And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ ."
[20:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
[20:09] Speaker_B | Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative
[20:18] Speaker_B | of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
[20:44] Speaker_C | With lot of functionalities .
[20:45] Speaker_B | A lot of functionalities . So that is uh that is uh for both th
[20:47] Speaker_D | So without L_C_D_ ?
[20:51] Speaker_B | Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them .
[21:00] Speaker_D | No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?
[21:05] Speaker_B | Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .
[21:07] Speaker_D | With L_C_D_ . And without L_C_D_ ?
[21:07] Speaker_A | For L_C_D_ .
[21:09] Speaker_B | Both .
[21:09] Speaker_C | Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
[21:10] Speaker_B | For both .
[21:12] Speaker_B | It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .
[21:13] Speaker_D | Okay .
[21:17] Speaker_A | Without L_C_D_ .
[21:18] Speaker_B | Both .
[21:29] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:29] Speaker_B | Mm .
[21:32] Speaker_A | Uh no innovative yeah .
[21:32] Speaker_B | Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
[21:56] Speaker_A | So let's remove it .
[21:58] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
[22:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[22:05] Speaker_C | Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
[22:07] Speaker_B | Yes exactly .
[22:09] Speaker_A | This is the problem .
[22:10] Speaker_D | No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
"[22:13] Speaker_C | If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n"
"[22:13] Speaker_D | L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a"
[22:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:20] Speaker_B | But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
[22:29] Speaker_B | Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_
[22:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:40] Speaker_D | So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
"[22:48] Speaker_D | And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?"
[23:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:10] Speaker_C | Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use .
[23:17] Speaker_B | Yeah I think sorry .
[23:20] Speaker_A | No it's just if I I see the
[23:26] Speaker_A | the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
[23:34] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:40] Speaker_D | Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates .
[23:48] Speaker_D | So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah .
[23:52] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[24:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's cheaper to produce ."
[24:11] Speaker_D | Yeah that's right .
"[24:13] Speaker_B | Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module ."
[24:22] Speaker_C | Yep .
[24:23] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[24:34] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah that's right .
[25:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[25:05] Speaker_D | So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
[25:05] Speaker_C | Six .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[25:09] Speaker_D | Or you want it to be six ?
[25:11] Speaker_C | Um six .
[25:12] Speaker_B | I think it's the same .
[25:14] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:15] Speaker_C | Yes as you say , with better uh yeah ."
[25:18] Speaker_A | Without L_C_D_ .
[25:18] Speaker_D | S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
[25:24] Speaker_C | And to improve the the look .
"[25:25] Speaker_D | As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use ."
[25:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:31] Speaker_B | Mm .
[25:31] Speaker_C | Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
[25:37] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:43] Speaker_D | So .
[25:43] Speaker_A | What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?
[25:46] Speaker_B | Huh ?
[25:49] Speaker_B | The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
[25:52] Speaker_B | Right ?
[25:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[25:52] Speaker_D | That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no ."
[25:57] Speaker_A | Ah so it's optional with the okay .
[25:58] Speaker_D | It's an optional .
[26:04] Speaker_A | I think it will be I think i
[26:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it ."
"[26:32] Speaker_D | In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work ."
[26:34] Speaker_B | Oh .
[26:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:00] Speaker_A | So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional .
"[27:05] Speaker_B | Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag ."
[27:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[27:35] Speaker_C | Well you can if you had uh something li
[27:37] Speaker_A | I think it i increases .
[27:48] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[27:50] Speaker_D | But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .
[28:00] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:05] Speaker_B | Mm .
[28:07] Speaker_D | On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah .
[28:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[28:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:09] Speaker_B | Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons ."
[28:21] Speaker_D | Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional .
[28:38] Speaker_D | So it's something like a Microsoft product update . Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it .
[28:57] Speaker_D | And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
[29:17] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[29:21] Speaker_D | Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all ."
[29:27] Speaker_B | Mm .
[29:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[29:37] Speaker_B | What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better ."
"[29:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah that's right ."
[29:50] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
[29:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:55] Speaker_D | Yeah that's right .

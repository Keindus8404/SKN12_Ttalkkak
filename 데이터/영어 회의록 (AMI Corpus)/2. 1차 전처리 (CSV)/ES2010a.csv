And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here ."
[02:14] Speaker_B | I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .

"[05:34] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
[05:39] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[05:47] Speaker_A | Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote ."
"[05:51] Speaker_D | No , that's good ."
"[06:48] Speaker_A | Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So ."
[07:06] Speaker_C | Now ?
[07:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ?
"[07:10] Speaker_B | Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? One remote for everything ."
[07:13] Speaker_A | Right .
[07:15] Speaker_D | Right .
"[07:16] Speaker_C | And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?"
[07:18] Speaker_B | Um .
[07:27] Speaker_B | I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly .
"[07:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , TiVo ."
[07:29] Speaker_A | TiVo .
"[07:30] Speaker_C | But it's still there , so"
[07:32] Speaker_B | Okay .
[07:34] Speaker_D | It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .
"[07:37] Speaker_A | They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club ."
"[07:46] Speaker_C | Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know ."
[07:50] Speaker_B | So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .
[07:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[07:55] Speaker_D | And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways ."
[07:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[08:05] Speaker_A | 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . Yeah . Ones that ones that look high-tech , too ."
[08:20] Speaker_D | They want like the flashy lights . Oh like this came from Las Vegas .
[08:26] Speaker_C | But at the same time are simple .
[08:28] Speaker_A | Right . So that people like my mother can use it .
[08:28] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
[08:29] Speaker_B | What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?
[08:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's true .
[08:47] Speaker_C | Um .
[08:49] Speaker_B | What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually Okay .
[08:52] Speaker_C | Double A_ .
[08:53] Speaker_D | Double A_ .
[08:55] Speaker_A | Do some of them use triple A_s though ?
[08:57] Speaker_D | Yeah some use triple A_s . So double or triple ?
[08:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[09:03] Speaker_C | If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around ."
[09:11] Speaker_C | Right .
[09:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[09:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ ."
"[09:17] Speaker_A | Triple A . But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . Hey . Anything else ?"
[09:18] Speaker_B | Can you with a small lithium battery ?
[09:34] Speaker_A | Alright . Moving along .
"[09:58] Speaker_A | Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification ."
[10:00] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[10:19] Speaker_A | I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay . And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?"
[10:26] Speaker_D | Right .
[10:37] Speaker_A | Okay . This meeting is officially over .

"[00:01] Speaker_A | Wait for the marketing director actually , so ."
[00:07] Speaker_A | Anyways .
[00:13] Speaker_A | Uh .
"[00:21] Speaker_A | See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway . There you are , okay ."
"[00:29] Speaker_B | Oh , there he is ."
"[00:29] Speaker_D | Yes . Sorry , a little bit of pl little problem with computer ."
"[00:32] Speaker_A | Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat ."
"[00:39] Speaker_A | Okay , welcome again . Today , functional design phase ."
[00:48] Speaker_D | Uh .
"[00:53] Speaker_A | I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you ."
"[01:09] Speaker_A | Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later . But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like wanna go first ?"
[01:29] Speaker_B | Go ahead .
[01:29] Speaker_A | Take it .
[01:37] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[01:48] Speaker_D | Okay , and"
[01:49] Speaker_A | Uh it's still a bit open .
[01:51] Speaker_D | I want to open the my s oh no .
"[01:54] Speaker_A | You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . Yeah . So there ? Okay ."
"[01:57] Speaker_D | Oh no , that's okay ."
[02:00] Speaker_D | Uh slide show .
"[02:34] Speaker_A | If I can cut in , is it people or men ? Is it people , okay . 'Cause I thought it was only men , so 'Kay ."
[02:51] Speaker_A | So we have to s we have to do something about that .
"[03:11] Speaker_D | So that's the most important things . Um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine"
[03:12] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[03:18] Speaker_D | on my PowerPoint presentation , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . Uh less important is tel teletext ,"
"[03:20] Speaker_A | Okay , just talk ahead ."
[03:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[03:47] Speaker_A | Okay , that's okay ."
[03:54] Speaker_A | That's a little weird .
"[04:05] Speaker_A | Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay ."
"[04:06] Speaker_B | Oh , okay ."
[04:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:17] Speaker_A | That's like a button on your T_V_ ?
[04:26] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[04:26] Speaker_A | Remote , okay ."
[04:44] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:55] Speaker_A | We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . Okay .
[05:00] Speaker_B | Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
"[05:03] Speaker_A | That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue ."
[05:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:07] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[05:11] Speaker_D | Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh"
"[05:22] Speaker_D | f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um"
"[05:37] Speaker_A | Okay , you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel ."
[05:42] Speaker_D | What ?
[05:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:52] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:54] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like ."
"[05:57] Speaker_A | Okay , so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it Okay ."
[06:08] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:08] Speaker_D | I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . It's a little bit uh I lost it , the computer uh crashed , so ."
[06:11] Speaker_A | I see .
[06:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:16] Speaker_B | Okay .
[06:21] Speaker_B | Shall I go ? Okay .
[06:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[06:32] Speaker_B | So , some technical functions ."
[06:33] Speaker_D | Darn computer .
"[06:35] Speaker_B | Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues ."
[06:39] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[06:49] Speaker_B | So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong"
[07:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:13] Speaker_A | That seems very good .
[07:25] Speaker_B | There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .
[07:35] Speaker_D | Mm uh .
[07:35] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[07:39] Speaker_B | There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , yes . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes"
"[07:47] Speaker_A | Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . Okay ."
"[08:04] Speaker_B | kablouey or something like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si"
[08:10] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Yeah .
[08:14] Speaker_A | Wow . The s Yeah . Make it make them bigger . Even more durable uh .
[08:36] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:38] Speaker_B | This I pretty much covered . So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons ."
"[08:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's true ."
[08:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:50] Speaker_B | So that's basically uh what I had in mind .
"[08:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's clear ."
"[08:54] Speaker_B | This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea ."
[08:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:03] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[09:05] Speaker_A | That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget ."
"[09:15] Speaker_B | Yeah , I think it's a really good idea ."
[09:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[09:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[09:31] Speaker_C | Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me ."
"[09:40] Speaker_C | Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already ."
[10:05] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[10:30] Speaker_C | So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper ."
[10:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[10:35] Speaker_A | Yeah . Of course , hmm ."
[10:36] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:05] Speaker_A | You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay .
"[11:07] Speaker_C | Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning ."
[11:47] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[11:48] Speaker_C | Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light ."
[12:10] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:14] Speaker_A | Okay . That was it ? I'll get back to my thing then .
[12:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:13] Speaker_D | Uh .
[13:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[13:17] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[13:22] Speaker_A | They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it ."
[13:31] Speaker_D | Where with more technical specifications
[13:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:58] Speaker_A | With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money"
[14:05] Speaker_B | Oh .
[14:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:10] Speaker_A | on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design .
[14:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:37] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[14:40] Speaker_A | I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ?"
[14:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:47] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:47] Speaker_D | But oh ?
[14:48] Speaker_B | Is it manageable ? Is it easy ?
[14:48] Speaker_C | Go ahead .
"[14:53] Speaker_A | Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , like you said . I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , it consumes batteries like hell ."
"[14:55] Speaker_C | Yes , I think so too ."
[14:55] Speaker_D | Why ? Nokia w
[14:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:00] Speaker_D | Uh .
"[15:01] Speaker_A | I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . It costs a lot , I think . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . For example , a little T_V_ guide ."
[15:02] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:03] Speaker_B | And it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on a tight budget here ."
[15:06] Speaker_D | Okay .
[15:13] Speaker_C | Mm .
[15:16] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[15:16] Speaker_A | Like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , but maybe okay , make it Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but What did I write down ? I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . Uh speech recognition ."
[15:18] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[15:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[15:22] Speaker_C | Hmm . I have to check that out , I'm not sure ."
[15:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:32] Speaker_C | That must be possible .
[15:35] Speaker_C | Ja .
"[15:36] Speaker_C | I'm sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control ."
"[15:41] Speaker_A | I thin Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ?"
[15:48] Speaker_C | Because that's not possible uh .
"[15:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?"
[15:52] Speaker_C | Uh .
[15:53] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[15:56] Speaker_B | Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .
"[16:00] Speaker_A | A slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . Yeah , that could be possible . A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay ."
[16:04] Speaker_D | Mm uh .
"[16:04] Speaker_B | Yeah , exactly ."
"[16:08] Speaker_C | Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . If not Okay ."
[16:15] Speaker_A | I think it's universal .
"[16:17] Speaker_A | I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . I think universal remote control should be possible ."
[16:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[16:28] Speaker_C | Okay , then I go for that ."
"[16:29] Speaker_D | Everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w yeah ."
[16:31] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[16:33] Speaker_C | Okay . No , it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for ."
"[16:35] Speaker_A | Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do ."
[16:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:44] Speaker_D | Or one .
"[16:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever ."
[16:52] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
"[16:53] Speaker_B | Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this ."
[16:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:02] Speaker_B | It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet ."
[17:05] Speaker_A | I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
[17:09] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[17:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:17] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[17:17] Speaker_A | So the the the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first ."
[17:19] Speaker_C | Exactly . I already noted that .
"[17:27] Speaker_C | Mm , okay ."
[17:30] Speaker_C | Okay .
[17:30] Speaker_A | Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . Let's see .
[17:33] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[17:34] Speaker_C | If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language ."
[17:41] Speaker_A | For example ?
[17:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:47] Speaker_C | That's okay , okay ."
[17:51] Speaker_C | Huh .
[17:52] Speaker_D | But b
[17:57] Speaker_C | Uh okay .
"[18:04] Speaker_A | No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue"
[18:07] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[18:08] Speaker_B | C that's a problem with the with the text then .
[18:12] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[18:17] Speaker_A | you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . So it's a good and a bad idea ."
[18:21] Speaker_C | Mm .
[18:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[18:31] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:36] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[18:37] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , I know what you mean ."
[18:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:42] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[18:42] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:50] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[19:04] Speaker_A | So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with ."
[19:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[19:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[19:24] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway ."
[19:27] Speaker_B | Pretty straightforward .
"[19:40] Speaker_A | So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ ."
[20:02] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[20:04] Speaker_B | Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?"
[20:10] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:16] Speaker_A | That is true .
[20:18] Speaker_C | I don't think so .
"[20:19] Speaker_A | No , that's true ."
"[20:20] Speaker_C | No , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's Exactly , that's not possible ."
"[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true ."
"[20:23] Speaker_B | It's an in-built menu , isn't it ? Yes ."
"[20:28] Speaker_A | I'm not sure if it's impossible , but uh there's a chance it's not , so ."
[20:37] Speaker_A | A double-sided remote control ? I don't think that's useful .
"[20:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ ."
[20:49] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[20:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:54] Speaker_A | I don't think we should Yeah , for exam"
[21:03] Speaker_D | Mm yeah .
"[21:03] Speaker_A | I'm not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but"
[21:13] Speaker_C | Mm .
[21:15] Speaker_C | Mm .
[21:21] Speaker_C | But that might be broken .
[21:21] Speaker_A | you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands .
[21:28] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[21:37] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[21:39] Speaker_A | Especially the big ones , the big brands , so . 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing ."
[21:40] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[21:46] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[22:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true . I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay ."
[22:07] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[22:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:13] Speaker_C | Okay , I thi I think so too ."
"[22:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
"[22:24] Speaker_C | And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . We should not do that ."
[22:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[22:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:38] Speaker_A | Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever ."
[22:40] Speaker_C | Exactly .
[22:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , I have some ideas ."
[22:44] Speaker_B | I have some ideas .
[22:44] Speaker_D | Um yeah .
[22:47] Speaker_D | And uh with different colours uh .
[22:49] Speaker_B | I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .
"[22:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , this . Not sure what because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so ."
[22:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[22:58] Speaker_B | I heard a beep go .
[23:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:12] Speaker_A | Yeah , may maybe something like this ."
[23:15] Speaker_A | But though smooth inside .
"[23:20] Speaker_A | So you have the transmitter here for example . Let's see that you what would be handy . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Let's see one , two God damn it ."
[23:22] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:24] Speaker_D | Uh .
"[23:34] Speaker_B | Oh , we get the general ideas , yes ."
"[23:39] Speaker_A | Another one here . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here ."
[23:43] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[23:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah ."
[23:49] Speaker_D | Volume .
"[23:51] Speaker_A | Withi within the Yeah , just take it ."
[23:54] Speaker_B | So you have the up channel
"[24:02] Speaker_D | Uh it's it's fine , I think ."
[24:03] Speaker_A | Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . Yeah .
[24:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:11] Speaker_B | Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle ."
[24:11] Speaker_D | Oh d
[24:19] Speaker_B | Whoa .
[24:20] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[24:21] Speaker_C | Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep ."
[24:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[24:29] Speaker_A | Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash ."
[24:32] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[24:33] Speaker_A | And flash takes up a lot of batteries again .
[24:34] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[24:36] Speaker_C | Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost ."
[24:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:40] Speaker_B | We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .
[24:40] Speaker_C | So .
[24:43] Speaker_D | And L_E_D_ uh on it .
"[24:45] Speaker_A | Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see ."
"[24:52] Speaker_B | So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button"
"[24:56] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , it's true ."
[24:56] Speaker_B | somewhere over here ?
"[24:58] Speaker_A | Um that thing should be central . You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere ."
[25:00] Speaker_D | Very important .
[25:05] Speaker_B | I usually
[25:08] Speaker_B | press it on top . At least that's what I'm accustomed to .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:18] Speaker_B | What would you like to ?
[25:20] Speaker_D | But you r
[25:28] Speaker_C | Mm .
[25:30] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:39] Speaker_A | Mute . Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
[25:41] Speaker_D | So i it's sorry ?
[25:43] Speaker_A | Mute . Turn the sound off .
"[25:45] Speaker_D | No , it's no ."
[25:49] Speaker_D | Uh .
[25:51] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[25:54] Speaker_B | It's not that important , no ."
[26:06] Speaker_A | Can I have that ? That's j
[26:07] Speaker_B | Sure .
"[26:18] Speaker_B | That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ?"
"[26:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is should be"
[26:28] Speaker_A | the channels and or sh
"[26:31] Speaker_B | Well , I'm accustomed to the channels being on top ."
[26:32] Speaker_D | No . Yeah .
"[26:33] Speaker_C | Yeah , me too ."
"[26:34] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's better . On the right ."
[26:41] Speaker_A | up and down .
[26:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:50] Speaker_D | Maybe it's more ex expensive .
"[26:51] Speaker_C | Mm , yeah ."
"[26:53] Speaker_A | Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying ."
[26:55] Speaker_C | Uh .
[27:00] Speaker_C | But that's already possible .
[27:00] Speaker_B | But isn't that expensive in the entire package ?
[27:02] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[27:03] Speaker_A | I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour ."
[27:14] Speaker_C | Yes .
[27:20] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[27:24] Speaker_C | Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ?"
[27:31] Speaker_A | I think I have a nice idea .
[27:39] Speaker_A | Not exactly uh .
"[27:40] Speaker_C | You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire ."
[27:43] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[27:45] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah .
"[27:46] Speaker_A | I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it ."
"[27:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's g"
"[27:55] Speaker_C | But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station ."
[27:57] Speaker_A | I'm not sure . A what ?
"[28:04] Speaker_A | Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . It could be very flat , could be very small . It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example ."
[28:09] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[28:11] Speaker_C | That is possible , that's true ."
[28:21] Speaker_C | Mm .
[28:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:24] Speaker_A | And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
[28:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:28] Speaker_A | for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . I don't think it's very expensive ."
[28:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[28:32] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[28:35] Speaker_A | I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r"
[28:37] Speaker_C | Mm .
[28:39] Speaker_A | That's that you that's what you buy yourself .
"[28:44] Speaker_A | It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible ."
[28:45] Speaker_B | And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?
"[28:47] Speaker_D | Yeah , they want to pay for it ."
[28:48] Speaker_A | Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ?
[28:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[28:51] Speaker_A | I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important ."
"[28:55] Speaker_C | Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . Well , this is comfort ."
[28:55] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:04] Speaker_D | But f hmm .
[29:09] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[29:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station ."
[29:17] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[29:19] Speaker_C | Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . I would buy it myself .
[29:27] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[29:32] Speaker_A | Covers is covers is good . Yeah , it's Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant ."
[29:45] Speaker_A | So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .
"[29:51] Speaker_A | Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like ."
[29:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[29:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay ."
[30:00] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah .
[30:04] Speaker_C | Mm . Yeah .
[30:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:07] Speaker_C | I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , I need it ."
[30:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:28] Speaker_B | You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh"
[30:31] Speaker_B | see some of it .
[30:33] Speaker_C | Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ?
"[30:36] Speaker_A | No , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so ."
"[30:36] Speaker_B | No , it's not . No ."
[30:36] Speaker_C | Not .
[30:39] Speaker_A | So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft .
[30:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[30:41] Speaker_D | My computer crashed , so uh"
"[30:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , okay ."
"[30:45] Speaker_D | I lost my uh presentation , but"
"[30:45] Speaker_B | Oh , your computer . Okay ."
"[30:50] Speaker_B | Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that ."
"[30:53] Speaker_D | Yeah , but I"
[30:55] Speaker_D | Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our
[30:56] Speaker_B | Let's see .
"[30:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , the oh , they inc uh they include the new one . Or just for you ."
"[30:59] Speaker_D | internet , and here is my"
[31:10] Speaker_B | Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Because we decided that it's n not that important . Do we put it somewhere over here ?
[31:14] Speaker_A | All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one .
"[31:23] Speaker_D | And uh wha what people want ,"
"[31:24] Speaker_B | Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas ."
[31:26] Speaker_D | I've uh
[31:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:37] Speaker_A | More or less .
"[31:39] Speaker_A | Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best ."
[31:41] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:43] Speaker_C | What uh what did you wanna say ?
[31:44] Speaker_A | Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .
[31:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:50] Speaker_B | Maybe another idea uh .
[31:58] Speaker_C | Mm . Mm .
"[31:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot ."
[32:02] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[32:07] Speaker_A | Well what we had function that what people do , so . People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented ."
"[32:25] Speaker_B | Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus ."
"[32:33] Speaker_A | That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu ."
"[32:38] Speaker_C | But that's the question , is it ? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . If it isn't , then we cannot reach it ."
[32:44] Speaker_B | We need to adjust to the technology .
[32:45] Speaker_A | But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .
"[32:46] Speaker_C | I think so too . I think so too . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?"
[32:48] Speaker_B | True .
"[32:53] Speaker_C | If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . That's a bad bad com commercial for okay ."
[33:05] Speaker_A | Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with .
"[33:07] Speaker_D | Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition ."
[33:13] Speaker_A | Under forty . Yeah ?
[33:15] Speaker_C | That's true .
[33:21] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[33:22] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah .
[33:27] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[33:29] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[33:30] Speaker_A | The want to pay for Oh .
[33:35] Speaker_A | Uh shall we ?
[33:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[33:37] Speaker_B | Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen ."
"[33:37] Speaker_A | Younger , age sixteen and forty five ."
"[33:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . Okay , so we're not focusing on this ."
"[33:54] Speaker_A | All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ oh here . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Hmm , okay ?"
[34:05] Speaker_D | So uh
[34:08] Speaker_D | we can
[34:10] Speaker_D | We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno . Yeah .
[34:13] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[34:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes ."
[34:16] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[34:18] Speaker_C | Uh .
[34:26] Speaker_C | But I really need finance information .
"[34:28] Speaker_A | Me too . I mean we all do . Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible ."
[34:36] Speaker_C | Mm .
[34:38] Speaker_C | Uh .
[34:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:40] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[34:51] Speaker_D | Different colours maybe .
"[34:52] Speaker_C | Hmm . And the design , it should differ . This is Philips , huh ? Philips has this ."
[34:57] Speaker_A | I have no clue . I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .
[35:00] Speaker_C | Okay .
[35:01] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[35:03] Speaker_C | Uh .
[35:03] Speaker_B | Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic .
"[35:08] Speaker_C | Mm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , because I need to put all the electronics in it . If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it ."
[35:15] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[35:19] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[35:21] Speaker_A | Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back ?"
[35:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[35:28] Speaker_C | No .
"[35:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , sure ."
"[35:35] Speaker_A | So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now ."
[35:52] Speaker_A | So a transmitter here . Anyway .
"[35:56] Speaker_A | We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here ."
[36:06] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[36:14] Speaker_A | No ? It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top ."
[36:15] Speaker_C | Me too .
[36:17] Speaker_C | Ah but .
[36:29] Speaker_A | How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?
"[36:31] Speaker_D | But nee the function of it . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot ."
"[36:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , but why I I'm not sure ."
[36:41] Speaker_B | Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand .
"[36:44] Speaker_A | Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like ."
[36:44] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[36:48] Speaker_C | No . M I personally would prefer it on the top .
[36:53] Speaker_A | You would prefer it n Okay . So we have three people saying it should be on top .
[36:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[36:54] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[36:58] Speaker_A | Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Anyways ."
[37:02] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[37:02] Speaker_D | It's expensive to build it , so"
[37:04] Speaker_C | Mm .
[37:06] Speaker_D | you must use the maximum of it .
[37:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:10] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[37:12] Speaker_C | They want it uh .
[37:21] Speaker_D | Huh .
"[37:22] Speaker_C | Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space ."
[37:31] Speaker_C | So I have to look if that's possible .
"[37:34] Speaker_D | Yeah , I know uh ."
"[37:35] Speaker_B | So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ?"
[37:47] Speaker_D | In middle of it .
"[37:47] Speaker_A | Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example ."
[37:49] Speaker_D | In the middle .
[37:58] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[37:59] Speaker_B | Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function ."
[38:04] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[38:06] Speaker_D | It's the most import yeah .
"[38:12] Speaker_B | Well , that would make them quite small . So maybe you'd put them here ."
"[38:19] Speaker_B | Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like ."
[38:23] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[38:26] Speaker_C | If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . That might be an option ."
"[38:33] Speaker_A | Yeah . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely ."
"[38:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . But it has to be a little bit heavier ."
"[38:43] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big ."
[38:47] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[38:49] Speaker_C | No , but the things behind it . space ."
[38:54] Speaker_A | Mm let's see .
[38:55] Speaker_C | Like a process uh .
[38:55] Speaker_D | Finish meeting now . It's on your computer .
"[39:02] Speaker_A | We either we have to decide what what people want . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one ."
[39:03] Speaker_C | I like this one more .
"[39:24] Speaker_A | small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down ,"
[39:24] Speaker_D | Uh .
[39:35] Speaker_C | Mm .
[39:35] Speaker_A | and volume here .
[39:35] Speaker_B | Let's see what we have here .
"[39:40] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . I think it's L_C_D_ is better now ."
[39:45] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[39:46] Speaker_A | Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes ."
[39:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[39:50] Speaker_C | I'll try to .
[39:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[39:52] Speaker_C | One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Shall we all try uh to think about a name ?"
[40:00] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[40:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay , yeah , that's yeah , that's okay ."
[40:03] Speaker_B | So I think of a name .
"[40:04] Speaker_A | Yeah , let's think of a name , okay ."
[40:08] Speaker_A | Uh okay .
"[40:11] Speaker_D | Oh , good ."
"[40:13] Speaker_A | Okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh ."
"[40:19] Speaker_B | Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch ."
[40:23] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[40:29] Speaker_C | Good luck .
"[40:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , to all ."
[40:31] Speaker_D | Same .
[40:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[40:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , I've Do we uh save the ?"

[00:05] Speaker_D | Oh right okay .
[00:38] Speaker_D | They're .
"[01:17] Speaker_A | Right . Hello everybody . Back again for another wonderful meeting . Is uh everyone ready ? Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute ."
[01:18] Speaker_C | Hello .
[01:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[01:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[01:50] Speaker_D | Oh my gosh .
[02:06] Speaker_C | That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .
[02:21] Speaker_B | Mm 'kay .
[02:23] Speaker_A | Are you ready ?
"[02:39] Speaker_A | Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on ."
"[03:18] Speaker_A | now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want ."
[03:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[03:44] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[03:52] Speaker_A | Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
[04:16] Speaker_D | Batteries .
"[04:19] Speaker_B | No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing ."
"[04:21] Speaker_A | It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first ."
[04:23] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[04:23] Speaker_B | Okay . Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see ."
[04:28] Speaker_D | It's here .
[04:37] Speaker_B | Would that work ?
[04:44] Speaker_D | Ah .
[05:02] Speaker_A | I don't think any of us remember the fifties .
[05:04] Speaker_C | Is it like a crank thing or something .
[05:15] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[05:22] Speaker_C | Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power ."
[05:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:29] Speaker_A | Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?"
[05:30] Speaker_D | Mm .
[05:37] Speaker_B | I dunno actually .
[05:37] Speaker_A | Does anybody know ?
"[05:39] Speaker_C | Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know ."
[05:43] Speaker_B | I dunno .
[05:45] Speaker_B | Um .
"[05:47] Speaker_B | Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that ."
[05:49] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:53] Speaker_D | Mm .
[06:06] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[06:08] Speaker_A | Okay , jolly good ."
[06:24] Speaker_A | What's a double curved one ?
"[06:26] Speaker_B | You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing ."
[06:33] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[07:23] Speaker_A | So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah ."
[07:25] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:45] Speaker_D | Mm .
[07:49] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[07:52] Speaker_A | Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?"
[08:02] Speaker_B | Uh s so if d okay .
"[08:07] Speaker_B | And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display ."
"[08:21] Speaker_B | Um scroll buttons , as well ."
[08:26] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[08:26] Speaker_B | So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint ."
"[08:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons ."
[08:55] Speaker_B | If that makes sense .
[09:01] Speaker_B | Yeah . .
"[09:15] Speaker_B | No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,"
"[09:21] Speaker_B | then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons ."
[09:53] Speaker_C | Okay .
[09:57] Speaker_B | I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .
"[09:59] Speaker_A | Let's have rubber push buttons , hey ."
[10:01] Speaker_C | Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .
"[10:03] Speaker_B | Let's go crazy . And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive ."
[10:17] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[10:43] Speaker_A | Simple , yeah ."
[10:46] Speaker_A | Chip on print . It's a bit .
"[11:02] Speaker_A | Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here"
[11:05] Speaker_B | Mm .
[11:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:19] Speaker_B | The infra-red .
[11:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:21] Speaker_A | Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?
"[11:49] Speaker_A | So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works ,"
"[11:56] Speaker_B | It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah ."
[11:58] Speaker_B | Totally .
[12:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[12:07] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . I agree ."
[12:08] Speaker_A | you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
[12:13] Speaker_B | So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
[12:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[12:21] Speaker_A | S yeah , push buttons ."
[12:23] Speaker_D | What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
[12:27] Speaker_A | What about what ?
"[12:28] Speaker_D | G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing ."
"[12:32] Speaker_A | Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?"
"[12:35] Speaker_D | Mm , I dunno ."
[12:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:52] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .
[13:17] Speaker_B | Hm .
"[13:25] Speaker_D | Oh , it just gives an answer ."
[13:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[13:36] Speaker_D | I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Oh , then forget about it . Oh right okay ."
[13:40] Speaker_B | Channel five . And then it switches on .
"[13:42] Speaker_C | No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . It it's just a remote that talks to you . Uh . I mean to certain cues ."
[13:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah .
[13:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:57] Speaker_C | 'Kay .
"[14:02] Speaker_C | Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery ."
"[14:04] Speaker_A | Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work ."
[14:04] Speaker_D | Mm .
[14:09] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[14:10] Speaker_B | Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Okay . So we'll go for the battery .
[14:10] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah .
"[14:18] Speaker_B | Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?"
"[14:22] Speaker_A | We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?"
[14:30] Speaker_D | So it will look like something like this .
[14:31] Speaker_B | Double ?
"[14:31] Speaker_A | The double whopper , please ."
"[14:33] Speaker_B | Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?"
"[14:36] Speaker_A | Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons ."
"[14:40] Speaker_C | So rubber rubber keys , yeah ."
"[14:41] Speaker_A | Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ ."
[14:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:59] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:00] Speaker_A | So that's another marketing point that we can use .
[15:02] Speaker_D | Well the rubber push-buttons .
[15:06] Speaker_A | But anything is gonna have buttons .
[15:09] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[15:10] Speaker_A | Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive ."
"[15:17] Speaker_A | You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing ."
[15:25] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[15:39] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good ."
"[15:40] Speaker_C | Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah ."
[15:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[15:49] Speaker_A | And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah ."
"[15:56] Speaker_B | Alright , that's me done ."
"[15:58] Speaker_A | Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface ."
[15:58] Speaker_C | Alright .
[16:00] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[16:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about ."
[16:09] Speaker_A | Great .
[16:10] Speaker_B | Sorry .
"[16:30] Speaker_C | Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine ."
[17:00] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[17:14] Speaker_C | So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless ."
[17:22] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[17:23] Speaker_C | Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that"
[17:42] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:42] Speaker_A | Mm .
[17:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:50] Speaker_D | Mm .
[17:52] Speaker_D | That does get annoying .
[18:14] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[18:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[18:31] Speaker_C | So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout"
"[18:53] Speaker_C | from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh"
[18:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:03] Speaker_C | it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . And for something for kids .
[19:08] Speaker_A | Do we have an uh example of a good one ?
[19:13] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
[19:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . Um .
[19:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:25] Speaker_C | And so ,"
"[19:27] Speaker_C | yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me ."
[19:42] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[20:07] Speaker_C | So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um ."
[20:11] Speaker_A | Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .
"[20:17] Speaker_C | I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad ."
[20:20] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:26] Speaker_C | Uh .
[20:28] Speaker_C | And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .
[20:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:36] Speaker_A | Okay , and we're not yeah . Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether"
"[21:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that ."
[21:11] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:14] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey .
"[21:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this ."
"[21:25] Speaker_C | I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple ."
"[21:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , sure ."
"[21:48] Speaker_A | Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah ."
[21:55] Speaker_A | Cool .
[22:08] Speaker_D | Right .
"[22:13] Speaker_D | Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets"
[22:19] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[22:20] Speaker_D | and what the fashions are for next year . Um .
[22:30] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[22:55] Speaker_A | Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?"
[22:56] Speaker_D | Yep .
[22:57] Speaker_C | Mm .
[22:59] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[23:08] Speaker_A | What's that mean ?
"[23:19] Speaker_C | Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market ."
[23:23] Speaker_D | That's new .
"[23:24] Speaker_A | Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap ."
[23:25] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[23:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either ."
[23:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[23:34] Speaker_D | Mm .
[23:34] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:45] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[23:48] Speaker_D | That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know ,"
[24:06] Speaker_D | at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
"[24:10] Speaker_A | Of course , they do . One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not ."
"[24:23] Speaker_A | Okay , well , what do you two think about this ?"
[24:27] Speaker_C | So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
[24:31] Speaker_C | electronics ?
"[24:31] Speaker_A | Yeah , what I don't understand what m"
"[24:32] Speaker_D | You could always insert , yeah ."
"[24:35] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ?"
"[24:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television ."
"[24:45] Speaker_A | It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ?"
"[24:49] Speaker_D | Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art ."
[24:58] Speaker_A | That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .
"[25:03] Speaker_B | Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now ."
[25:18] Speaker_B | Things like that .
"[25:19] Speaker_A | No , that would be your telephone in with your television ."
[25:22] Speaker_B | No i
"[25:30] Speaker_A | Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . An and there is no there is no such thing ."
[25:35] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[25:39] Speaker_D | Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really"
"[25:53] Speaker_D | really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have"
[26:03] Speaker_A | Okay .
[26:09] Speaker_D | and um just go creative .
"[26:10] Speaker_B | Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet ."
"[26:17] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , this that's that's very good ."
[26:22] Speaker_B | Change the batteries ever again .
"[26:24] Speaker_A | And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it ."
"[26:42] Speaker_D | I think , safety s"
"[26:43] Speaker_C | Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator ."
"[26:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done ."
[26:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[26:50] Speaker_D | Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,"
"[27:20] Speaker_C | Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them ."
[27:20] Speaker_D | and things .
[27:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[27:24] Speaker_D | Yeah . Rubber things .
"[27:36] Speaker_A | Well spongy , that's where . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there ."
"[27:38] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's great for us ."
[27:56] Speaker_D | So yeah .
[28:00] Speaker_A | Okay .
[28:05] Speaker_C | Right .
"[28:07] Speaker_A | Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though ."
[28:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[28:16] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's great ."
[28:28] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[28:40] Speaker_C | We don't have to follow every trend , I guess ."
[28:40] Speaker_D | Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
[28:44] Speaker_D | Some sort .
[28:44] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
[28:49] Speaker_C | The power button could be like a big apple or something .
[28:50] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[28:53] Speaker_B | Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that ."
"[29:03] Speaker_C | Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate ."
"[29:06] Speaker_A | Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is"
[29:18] Speaker_A | its image .
"[29:20] Speaker_A | Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?"
"[29:32] Speaker_D | I think , if it's rubber"
[29:36] Speaker_D | it needs to be
[29:37] Speaker_A | I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky .
"[29:39] Speaker_D | different . I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like"
"[29:46] Speaker_D | really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours ."
[30:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:05] Speaker_D | Bright natural colours , nothing"
[30:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[30:20] Speaker_A | Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?"
[30:24] Speaker_C | Mm .
[30:27] Speaker_D | Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo .
"[30:36] Speaker_A | Okay , what ?"
[30:38] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:39] Speaker_C | Sure .
[30:40] Speaker_B | Why not ?
[30:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[30:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:03] Speaker_D | I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool ."
"[31:13] Speaker_D | Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um"
[31:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[31:43] Speaker_D | Yeah . So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something ."
[32:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .

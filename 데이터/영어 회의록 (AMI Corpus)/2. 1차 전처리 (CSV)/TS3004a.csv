[01:52] Speaker_C | I think my laptop is a bit
[01:58] Speaker_C | etchy .

[02:27] Speaker_D | Press F_ eleven .
"[02:28] Speaker_A | Ah cool . Okay . So that's my name , . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting ."
"[02:45] Speaker_A | So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting ."
[02:52] Speaker_B | Yes .
"[03:21] Speaker_A | The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . Okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one ."
"[04:00] Speaker_A | And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . Folder , okay ."
"[04:06] Speaker_D | Folder , yes ."

[04:26] Speaker_A | so you can read . You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen .
"[04:46] Speaker_A | So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works ."
"[04:54] Speaker_A | Yes ? Okay . This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format ."
[04:54] Speaker_D | Ah I can see it now .
[04:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:04] Speaker_A | and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink .

[06:50] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:53] Speaker_D | Ah .
[06:56] Speaker_D | I'll take this one .

[10:07] Speaker_B | No I have it .
[10:09] Speaker_B | I just draw too quick I think .
"[10:12] Speaker_B | Okay , that's it ."
[10:15] Speaker_B | More .
[10:19] Speaker_B | It's just to get used to it .
[10:21] Speaker_C | Okay .
[10:46] Speaker_D | No .
"[10:47] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's right , it but you actually got to write on the paper . You really got to write on that paper ."
[10:51] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
"[10:53] Speaker_A | Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , so that's not just it's just a picture . So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be ."
"[10:53] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah , it's a real pen ."
"[10:57] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it's just a picture ."
[11:01] Speaker_D | Oh .
[11:02] Speaker_D | Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word .
[11:06] Speaker_B | No .
[11:06] Speaker_A | No .
"[11:07] Speaker_D | Oh , okay ."
[11:25] Speaker_B | It's a donkey .
"[11:33] Speaker_A | I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure ."
[11:38] Speaker_A | Half past .
[11:39] Speaker_D | Half past ten .
[11:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:41] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:49] Speaker_D | Brilliant .
"[11:50] Speaker_A | Okay , perfect ."
[11:51] Speaker_D | Yep .
[12:13] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[12:15] Speaker_A | Okay , so"
[12:18] Speaker_A | uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros .
[12:26] Speaker_C | Excuse me .
"[12:26] Speaker_A | Okay , that's . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe ."
[12:34] Speaker_B | Piece of cake .
"[12:34] Speaker_A | The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry ."
[12:36] Speaker_B | Uh easy .
[12:38] Speaker_A | So can someone make a
"[12:41] Speaker_A | a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls ."
"[12:58] Speaker_D | Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?"
"[13:04] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , that's a good question ."
"[13:06] Speaker_D | Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart ."
"[13:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , it probably would be universal ."
[13:20] Speaker_B | Universal . And only television ? Or more devices ?
"[13:31] Speaker_C | Hmm , maybe , I don't know ."
"[13:32] Speaker_D | Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros"
"[13:35] Speaker_A | Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect ."
"[13:38] Speaker_D | Yeah , I think ."
[13:39] Speaker_B | Ah okay .
[13:41] Speaker_C | And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay .
"[13:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control ."
[13:52] Speaker_B | Not just a T_V_ .
"[13:53] Speaker_A | No , just everything ."
[13:54] Speaker_B | Okay .
[13:55] Speaker_D | Okay .
[14:03] Speaker_B | Well we can try to make it special .
"[14:11] Speaker_D | Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it"
"[14:32] Speaker_D | uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons ."
"[14:49] Speaker_D | I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality ."
[14:58] Speaker_A | Hmm yeah .
[15:04] Speaker_A | That's right . Should be a good point .
[15:06] Speaker_C | Okay .
[15:09] Speaker_C | And how big should it be ?
"[15:16] Speaker_B | It shouldn't be too big , but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so ."
[15:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:24] Speaker_B | We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .
"[15:28] Speaker_A | Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it ."
[15:30] Speaker_B | Yeah . Or we have to make something uh
"[15:34] Speaker_B | like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,"
[15:38] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[15:45] Speaker_B | maybe more trendy .
"[15:47] Speaker_A | But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Okay , yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , if you just okay ."
[15:53] Speaker_C | Yeah n
"[15:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often ."
[15:55] Speaker_D | Ah right right .
"[15:56] Speaker_C | Yeah , or you c"
[16:05] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:05] Speaker_D | Oh that's good , yeah ."
[16:05] Speaker_C | O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .
[16:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:13] Speaker_A | Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? There are buttons on it .
[16:17] Speaker_B | No you can make an uh manual in it .
"[16:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small ."
[16:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[16:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , but"
[16:28] Speaker_A | But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
"[16:28] Speaker_C | Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would ."
"[16:28] Speaker_B | But that's Yeah , I think it's much uh too expensive ."
"[16:30] Speaker_D | Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken ."
[16:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile ."
"[16:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , too fragile ."
[16:54] Speaker_A | No .
[16:56] Speaker_C | Kid-proof .
"[17:07] Speaker_A | Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries ."
[17:07] Speaker_D | Ma maybe a home station .
[17:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:10] Speaker_C | Mm yeah .
"[17:12] Speaker_B | Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think ."
"[17:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?"
[17:16] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:17] Speaker_C | Yeah , I dunno ."
[17:19] Speaker_B | Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?
[17:25] Speaker_A | I dunno .
"[17:25] Speaker_C | Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing ."
[17:28] Speaker_D | Ah yeah .
"[17:34] Speaker_A | Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive ."
[17:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's right , yeah ."
[17:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:52] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[17:54] Speaker_D | Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive ."
[17:58] Speaker_B | Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .
[18:00] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:01] Speaker_D | You can yeah , you can buy it with it ."
[18:08] Speaker_B | Rechargeable .
"[18:09] Speaker_C | Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so ."
[18:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:16] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
"[18:17] Speaker_A | The option , just the option , that's cool ."
[18:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[18:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:53] Speaker_C | N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works ."
[19:00] Speaker_D | Nah .
[19:00] Speaker_B | Well you can um
"[19:03] Speaker_B | have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that ."
[19:13] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[19:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:34] Speaker_C | And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah . But n yeah , but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , so ."
"[19:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine ."
"[19:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[19:55] Speaker_A | But maybe it's
[19:58] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's what I meant .
[20:00] Speaker_A | maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called ?
[20:06] Speaker_D | Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .
"[20:14] Speaker_A | No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control ."
"[20:20] Speaker_B | Okay , but yeah ."
[20:23] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[20:23] Speaker_A | Just think about it . We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to what you have to do ?"
[20:27] Speaker_C | Okay .
[20:40] Speaker_D | Okay .
[20:42] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:53] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together . Yeah , everything ."
[20:59] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh ."
"[21:05] Speaker_A | Yeah , no maybe not not uh , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . That's not for you ."
[21:10] Speaker_B | Technical fun fu
[21:13] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[21:13] Speaker_A | Just if what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have ."
"[21:16] Speaker_B | What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . I already wrote some down , some ideas ."
"[21:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's alright ."
[21:24] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[21:24] Speaker_A | Yeah , just is that okay ?"
[21:27] Speaker_D | Okay .
[21:27] Speaker_B | Yep .
[21:27] Speaker_C | Okay .
[21:28] Speaker_A | Okay .
[21:29] Speaker_B | There's already a document in the
[21:32] Speaker_B | folder about it .
"[21:33] Speaker_D | Yeah , me too ."
[21:38] Speaker_A | So see you in thirty minutes .
"[21:40] Speaker_D | Okay , well done ."
[21:40] Speaker_B | Okay .
[21:40] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[21:42] Speaker_A | For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so your laptop ."
[21:47] Speaker_B | I will .
[21:51] Speaker_B | It didn't say that .
"[21:52] Speaker_A | No , sorry ."
[21:53] Speaker_B | Your fault .
[21:56] Speaker_D | Ciao .
[22:07] Speaker_B | Bye bye .

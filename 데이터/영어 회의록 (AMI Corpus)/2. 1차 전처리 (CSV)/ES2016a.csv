"[00:10] Speaker_A | Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work ."
"[00:27] Speaker_A | Oh , alright ."
[01:00] Speaker_A | Okay . Um alright .
"[01:03] Speaker_D | Uh , uh , um ."
"[01:07] Speaker_A | I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um ."
[01:33] Speaker_A | Go ahead .
"[01:34] Speaker_D | Okay . I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did ."
[02:18] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[02:19] Speaker_C | Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special ."
[02:51] Speaker_C | That's about it .
[03:22] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[03:40] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[03:43] Speaker_A | Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a"
"[04:18] Speaker_A | fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use ."
"[04:32] Speaker_A | we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um ."
[04:51] Speaker_A | w uh well um functional design um .
[05:03] Speaker_A | Um do we have um
"[05:09] Speaker_A | any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and"
[05:23] Speaker_A | and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .
"[05:26] Speaker_C | Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function ."
[05:33] Speaker_A | So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?
[05:43] Speaker_C | Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical
[05:48] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[05:53] Speaker_C | products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming ."
[05:56] Speaker_D | Mm .
[06:01] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
[06:05] Speaker_C | I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?
[06:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[06:12] Speaker_A | I I think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so I think we're all in the same boat here ."
[06:12] Speaker_C | Ye yeah .
[06:18] Speaker_D | Huh .
[06:31] Speaker_C | Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .
[06:35] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:36] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[06:36] Speaker_C | So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature ."
[06:40] Speaker_A | So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
[06:48] Speaker_C | Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep .
"[06:52] Speaker_B | Mm , mm ."
[06:55] Speaker_D | Mm .
[06:55] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[06:56] Speaker_B | Right .
[06:57] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[06:57] Speaker_D | Be good .
"[07:02] Speaker_C | Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance ."
[07:09] Speaker_C | Just long .
[07:15] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[07:16] Speaker_D | Lot more modern .
[07:18] Speaker_C | I think so .
[07:21] Speaker_C | Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .
"[07:24] Speaker_D | Maybe like user-friendly , like a little"
[07:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[07:27] Speaker_D | you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing ."
"[07:30] Speaker_C | People I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something ."
[07:30] Speaker_B | Mm .
[07:38] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[07:41] Speaker_D | Mm .
[07:41] Speaker_A | Um .
"[07:42] Speaker_B | Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people"
[07:48] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:02] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[08:14] Speaker_B | whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?"
[08:17] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[08:31] Speaker_C | It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .
"[08:34] Speaker_A | 'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,"
[08:48] Speaker_A | So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um
[09:24] Speaker_A | it what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal .
[09:32] Speaker_A | It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um
"[09:42] Speaker_A | you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so ."
[09:51] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[09:56] Speaker_D | Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal ."
[10:04] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[10:05] Speaker_D | That's more on the research end , but the marketing ."
"[10:09] Speaker_A | So marketing , you know , how maybe uh"
"[10:16] Speaker_A | marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there ."
"[10:27] Speaker_D | And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting ."
[10:33] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[10:36] Speaker_C | Small .
[10:39] Speaker_B | Right .
[11:05] Speaker_A | Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ?
"[11:16] Speaker_A | We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located ."
[11:28] Speaker_C | My original idea was just simply
"[11:50] Speaker_C | Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have"
"[11:58] Speaker_C | just sorta you you you know , your buttons ."
"[12:02] Speaker_C | Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible ."
"[12:12] Speaker_C | Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of"
"[12:20] Speaker_C | like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . But yeah ."
[12:26] Speaker_D | Futuristic .
[12:30] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[12:33] Speaker_C | Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?"
"[12:41] Speaker_B | Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem ."
[12:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[12:52] Speaker_C | Maybe f yeah .
"[12:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's g that's a good idea ."
"[13:01] Speaker_C | Yeah . The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though ."
[13:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[13:23] Speaker_A | How would we go about um
[13:42] Speaker_B | N n
[13:42] Speaker_A | What did you say your title was again ?
"[13:44] Speaker_B | Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is"
[13:45] Speaker_A | You're the the Industrial Designer .
[14:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:10] Speaker_C | Well I I suppose that things become design . But I mean i
[14:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[14:14] Speaker_C | I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah ."
[14:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[14:25] Speaker_A | It's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um ."
[14:30] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:35] Speaker_D | 'Kay , I'll draw something . What ? My idea was just to have it be kind of like a"
"[14:36] Speaker_A | So if no , go ahead ."
"[14:47] Speaker_D | keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know ."
[14:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:05] Speaker_C | I think definitely doing something different
[15:07] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:08] Speaker_C | is a good idea .
[15:20] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[15:22] Speaker_C | I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier ."
[15:33] Speaker_A | Something with a grip .
[15:33] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah .
"[15:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , with a grip ."
"[15:44] Speaker_C | It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah ."
[15:45] Speaker_A | it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um .
[15:48] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:55] Speaker_C | Like yeah .
[16:04] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:06] Speaker_C | It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .
[16:10] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[16:22] Speaker_B | Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but"
[16:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:36] Speaker_B | may not be th as functional .
"[16:43] Speaker_A | Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um ."
[17:10] Speaker_A | Let's see here .
"[17:20] Speaker_A | What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So"
"[17:48] Speaker_A | you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part ."
[17:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:09] Speaker_A | No , that wouldn't work either um ."
"[18:16] Speaker_A | But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the"
"[18:28] Speaker_A | sorta grips on the side here I guess ,"
[18:35] Speaker_A | and then
[18:44] Speaker_A | And then we have the problem with the hinge .
"[18:48] Speaker_A | So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want ."
"[18:51] Speaker_B | The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?"
"[18:58] Speaker_A | Mm , that's true ."
[19:23] Speaker_A | So we don't have it flip open .
[19:30] Speaker_C | But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .
[19:33] Speaker_B | To the other design .
[19:43] Speaker_B | Uh functional .
"[19:57] Speaker_A | Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way ."
"[20:05] Speaker_A | Course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . But it's one-handed um ."
[20:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:10] Speaker_B | Right . Right .
"[20:16] Speaker_B | Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design ."
[20:26] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:26] Speaker_D | Mm .
[20:35] Speaker_D | Right .
[20:37] Speaker_B | 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .
"[20:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do ."
"[20:46] Speaker_B | Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh"
"[20:54] Speaker_B | towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m"
"[20:59] Speaker_B | show which is the front , which is the back ."
[21:01] Speaker_A | Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
[21:07] Speaker_A | So that either way you're pointing it it would work .
"[21:08] Speaker_B | I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so ."
[21:13] Speaker_A | More expensive and yeah .
[21:15] Speaker_B | Course you can do that .
"[21:26] Speaker_B | I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work ."
[21:34] Speaker_A | True .
"[21:50] Speaker_C | Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it ."
[22:05] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[22:06] Speaker_D | Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . Yeah ."
[22:08] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[22:29] Speaker_A | Are good ideas , what are not ."
"[22:30] Speaker_C | Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think ."
[22:34] Speaker_A | Uh .
"[22:37] Speaker_A | Must finish now , so . And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want ."
[22:44] Speaker_D | Mm .
[22:46] Speaker_B | Alright .
[22:47] Speaker_D | Great .
"[22:49] Speaker_A | Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . And uh alright , good meeting ."

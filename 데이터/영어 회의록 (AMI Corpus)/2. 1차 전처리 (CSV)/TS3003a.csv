[00:15] Speaker_B | Morning .
[00:16] Speaker_C | Morning .
[00:19] Speaker_D | Yep .
[00:32] Speaker_A | Let's see .
"[00:35] Speaker_A | First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , hello . Hello . Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart . Welcome ."
[00:40] Speaker_D | My name's Frank .
[00:42] Speaker_B | I'm .
[00:48] Speaker_D | Thank you .
[00:50] Speaker_A | Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation .
"[01:05] Speaker_A | Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off ."
[01:46] Speaker_A | Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay . Let's do it read only .
"[01:56] Speaker_A | Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project ."
[02:20] Speaker_A | This is our agenda .
"[02:29] Speaker_A | Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see ."
"[02:41] Speaker_A | Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . No ?"
[02:43] Speaker_D | Sure .
[03:02] Speaker_D | Yep . Visit it .
[03:02] Speaker_B | Yep .
[03:09] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
[03:13] Speaker_A | I can
"[03:15] Speaker_A | see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here . Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . Um okay , what are we going to do ? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original ."
[03:32] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[03:36] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[03:58] Speaker_D | Okay .
[04:16] Speaker_B | Yep .
[04:20] Speaker_A | That's about the new remote control .
"[04:23] Speaker_A | Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design ."
"[04:48] Speaker_A | But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings ."
"[05:32] Speaker_A | Then we've got our first tool training . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little"
"[06:03] Speaker_A | uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there ."
[06:20] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[06:32] Speaker_B | Hmm .
"[06:52] Speaker_A | a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , uh project project what was it ? Project documents I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder ."
[07:15] Speaker_B | Okay .
[07:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[07:19] Speaker_A | Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings ."
[07:32] Speaker_A | And then we're going to try out the white board .
[07:48] Speaker_D | That was interesting .
[07:50] Speaker_A | Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? No . Okay . We're going to uh draw animal .
[08:26] Speaker_B | Okay .
[08:26] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[09:03] Speaker_A | Uh , see you have to do it real slow ."
[09:29] Speaker_B | Sure .
"[09:31] Speaker_A | Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close ."
[09:37] Speaker_D | I'm thinking about a swordfish .
"[09:39] Speaker_A | So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish . Yeah , he hasn't got an eye ."
[09:39] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
[09:44] Speaker_A | Woah . Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . And then you can undo
[09:53] Speaker_A | this easily .
[09:55] Speaker_D | Meat .
"[10:12] Speaker_A | They've got no text tool , no ."
[10:17] Speaker_A | Uh .
[10:39] Speaker_A | Maybe you have to hold it a bit
[11:01] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[11:10] Speaker_A | Oh .
[11:23] Speaker_A | Uh . I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal ? I don't know .
[11:31] Speaker_A | It lives for the fun .
[11:40] Speaker_A | It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . Go ahead .
[11:44] Speaker_B | Okay .
[11:51] Speaker_D | Thank you .
[11:54] Speaker_D | Okay .
[12:01] Speaker_D | Gonna use a different line width .
[12:04] Speaker_D | And I'm gonna draw in black .
"[12:09] Speaker_D | There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go ."
"[12:23] Speaker_A | Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did ."
[12:28] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[12:46] Speaker_B | A sheep .
[13:03] Speaker_D | Mm .
[13:32] Speaker_D | Sheep .
[13:40] Speaker_D | With of course
[13:49] Speaker_D | little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
[13:49] Speaker_A | Uh .
[13:54] Speaker_D | There .
[14:03] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[14:09] Speaker_D | Come on .
[14:18] Speaker_D | You have to go really slow when you're writing .
[14:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:39] Speaker_D | They're brilliant animal animals . And that's just a little me thingy .
[14:44] Speaker_D | So .
[14:48] Speaker_D | Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .
[14:49] Speaker_A | Nice .
[14:57] Speaker_B | Let's see .
[15:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
[15:15] Speaker_B | Uh .
[16:07] Speaker_D | Interesting .
[16:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . You know what that is ?
[16:14] Speaker_D | A rabbit ? Garfield . Yeah .
[16:15] Speaker_B | Or who ?
[16:15] Speaker_C | Garfield .
"[16:16] Speaker_B | Ah okay , yeah ."
[16:22] Speaker_B | Mm . Guess .
[16:30] Speaker_B | Yeah . That's enough .
"[16:34] Speaker_A | Yeah , just a blank sheet ."
[16:36] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[16:49] Speaker_C | Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . I'll just try something else . Something different than Garfield ."
[16:57] Speaker_A | No .
[17:25] Speaker_D | And the most interesting tail .
"[17:36] Speaker_C | Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh"
[17:42] Speaker_C | they are uh
[17:47] Speaker_C | independent .
[17:51] Speaker_A | Ah .
[17:54] Speaker_C | The pen .
[18:00] Speaker_C | So .
"[18:01] Speaker_A | Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy ."
[18:08] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[18:10] Speaker_C | The pen .
[18:22] Speaker_D | We're being haunted .
"[18:31] Speaker_A | move along to the project finance . Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium ."
"[19:11] Speaker_A | Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros ."
"[20:01] Speaker_D | Yeah , you got a message ."
"[20:06] Speaker_B | Five minutes , okay ."
"[20:10] Speaker_D | So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?"
[20:14] Speaker_B | Mm ?
[20:20] Speaker_A | Does it do anything ?
[20:22] Speaker_D | No .
[20:23] Speaker_A | Maybe you have to just clap it down ?
[20:27] Speaker_A | Mm back up again .
[20:33] Speaker_A | No slide show . Hmm .
[20:36] Speaker_D | It's off now .
"[20:37] Speaker_A | It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think ."
"[20:47] Speaker_D | Ah , there we are ."
"[20:48] Speaker_A | Nice . Okay . But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? No ? You ?"
[21:01] Speaker_B | Mm .
[21:04] Speaker_B | Oh really ?
[21:05] Speaker_B | Huh .
"[21:07] Speaker_D | Well , we have a"
"[21:07] Speaker_C | No , me neither ."
"[21:08] Speaker_D | kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all ."
[21:18] Speaker_A | Ah yeah .
"[21:24] Speaker_A | Yep . Yeah I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um"
[21:25] Speaker_B | Sure . Yeah .
"[21:34] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah . Yeah ."
"[21:46] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
[21:48] Speaker_D | Oh really .
[21:48] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[21:53] Speaker_B | Oh .
[21:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[21:57] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[22:00] Speaker_A | thing .
[22:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:15] Speaker_B | Oh .
[22:16] Speaker_A | That's good to remember .
[22:17] Speaker_D | So I think you can take minutes again .
"[22:19] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's nice , I think . So we've we want different functions"
[22:21] Speaker_D | Since it's your job .
[22:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:26] Speaker_A | uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think ."
[22:37] Speaker_B | Mm .
[22:45] Speaker_A | And other functions for a remote control ?
[22:50] Speaker_A | Maybe we can make it uh uh
[22:50] Speaker_D | Um .
[22:51] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[22:54] Speaker_D | Think it has to be shock proof
"[22:56] Speaker_B | Sure , yeah ."
[22:57] Speaker_A | Shock proof .
[22:58] Speaker_D | my remote control tends to fall a lot .
[23:06] Speaker_A | Waterproof .
[23:09] Speaker_A | Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .
[23:21] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
"[23:21] Speaker_D | Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it ."
[23:28] Speaker_D | So you can see
[23:28] Speaker_A | That's a battery stays .
"[23:30] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah ."
[23:30] Speaker_D | how much is left in the battery .
"[23:34] Speaker_D | But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too ."
[23:38] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:40] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:41] Speaker_A | Uh .
"[23:42] Speaker_D | But maybe just a little LED , I don't know ."
[23:45] Speaker_A | That's an idea as well . Other ideas ?
[23:49] Speaker_A | Quick ideas .
[23:51] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:52] Speaker_A | Okay . Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation .
[23:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:58] Speaker_D | Um .
"[24:00] Speaker_D | Nope , don't think so ."
[24:02] Speaker_A | No ?
"[24:03] Speaker_A | Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,"
[24:09] Speaker_A | and then we can all work .
[24:13] Speaker_D | Okay .
[24:15] Speaker_D | Aye sir .
[24:31] Speaker_D | Half an hour .
[24:33] Speaker_C | Okay .
[24:34] Speaker_B | Okay . Yep .
[24:34] Speaker_D | Okay .

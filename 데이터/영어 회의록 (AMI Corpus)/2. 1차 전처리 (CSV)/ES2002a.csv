[00:50] Speaker_B | Okay .
[00:53] Speaker_B | Right .
[01:06] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[01:14] Speaker_D | Great .
"[01:17] Speaker_A | Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer ."
[01:20] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:21] Speaker_D | And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing
[01:25] Speaker_C | Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface .
[01:26] Speaker_D | expert .
"[01:29] Speaker_B | Great . Okay . Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually . So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ?"
[01:44] Speaker_B | And you all arrived on time .
"[01:48] Speaker_B | Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . What did you get ?"
"[02:12] Speaker_A | Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . Designing a remote control . That's about it , didn't get anything else . Did you get the same thing ?"
[02:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[02:16] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[02:18] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it ."
[02:19] Speaker_B | Is that what everybody got ? Okay . Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ?
[02:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:21] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[02:46] Speaker_D | I will go . That's fine .
"[03:01] Speaker_D | This one here , right ?"
[03:02] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[03:03] Speaker_D | Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal
[03:23] Speaker_D | A beagle .
"[03:31] Speaker_D | Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle ."
[03:35] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[04:14] Speaker_C | Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey ."
"[04:27] Speaker_C | Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them ."
[04:35] Speaker_B | Right .
[04:35] Speaker_A | Cool .
"[04:45] Speaker_B | You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . Ok oh we do we do . Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway ."
[04:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:57] Speaker_B | Ach why not We might have to get you up again then .
[05:00] Speaker_B | I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now .
[05:06] Speaker_D | Impressionist .
[05:11] Speaker_A | Um .
[05:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[05:18] Speaker_A | Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice ."
[05:27] Speaker_B | Ah .
[05:38] Speaker_A | And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .
[05:41] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[05:42] Speaker_B | Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um ."
"[05:49] Speaker_D | Superb sketch , by the way ."
[05:59] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[06:06] Speaker_B | That doesn't really look like him , actually ."
"[06:12] Speaker_B | He looks more like a pig , actually ."
[06:15] Speaker_B | Ah well .
[06:18] Speaker_D | I see a dog in there . Yep .
[06:19] Speaker_B | Do you ? Oh that's very good of you .
[06:22] Speaker_D | Now I see a rooster .
[06:28] Speaker_B | Uh .
[06:33] Speaker_D | What kind is it ?
[06:53] Speaker_B | uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . Um
[07:11] Speaker_D | Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?
[07:13] Speaker_B | It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .
[07:20] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[07:24] Speaker_D | Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .
"[07:27] Speaker_B | Yeah , maybe ."
"[07:28] Speaker_B | Maybe . Right , um where did you find this ? Just down here ? Yeah ."
[07:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[07:45] Speaker_B | Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um"
"[07:52] Speaker_B | so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price ."
[08:08] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
"[08:16] Speaker_D | Um , can we just go over that again ?"
[08:17] Speaker_B | Sure .
"[08:19] Speaker_D | Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay ."
"[08:25] Speaker_D | So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf ."
[08:28] Speaker_B | All together .
[08:34] Speaker_B | Um I dunno . I imagine That's a good question .
"[08:38] Speaker_D | Our sale our sale anyway . Yeah , okay okay ."
[08:39] Speaker_B | I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the
[08:44] Speaker_B | the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .
[08:46] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:48] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[08:51] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[08:51] Speaker_B | But I I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?"
[08:59] Speaker_B | Think it will ? Um .
[09:00] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[09:03] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[09:08] Speaker_D | Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols ."
"[09:13] Speaker_B | Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . Yeah . Okay ."
"[09:24] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is ."
[09:24] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[09:25] Speaker_D | Um .
[09:28] Speaker_D | I don't know .
[09:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:31] Speaker_A | It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons ."
"[09:40] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . Okay ."
[09:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:41] Speaker_A | So , possibly ."
[09:42] Speaker_D | Yeah . And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking
"[09:57] Speaker_B | What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?"
"[10:02] Speaker_D | Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , something like that , yeah ."
"[10:15] Speaker_B | Aye , I see what you mean , yeah ."
"[10:18] Speaker_B | Marketing . Good marketing thoughts . Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um ."
[10:20] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[10:55] Speaker_D | Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . Um"
[11:00] Speaker_B | Mm .
[11:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost ."
[11:20] Speaker_D | Uh-huh .
"[11:21] Speaker_B | Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um"
"[11:24] Speaker_B | that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds ."
[11:27] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[11:29] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[11:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , I'd say so , yeah ."
"[11:32] Speaker_B | Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um ."
[11:36] Speaker_D | No .
"[11:42] Speaker_B | But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky ."
[11:44] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[11:46] Speaker_B | Um right , okay ."
[11:51] Speaker_B | Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ?
[12:02] Speaker_D | Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
"[12:06] Speaker_B | No , actually . That would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now ."
[12:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:12] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[12:14] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[12:15] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[12:33] Speaker_D | Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . It just comes along ."
"[12:47] Speaker_B | Yeah , yeah ."
[12:51] Speaker_B | Oh .
"[12:52] Speaker_B | Five minutes to end of meeting . Oh , okay . We're a bit behind ."
"[12:56] Speaker_D | Do you know what I mean ? Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something ."
[12:57] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:14] Speaker_C | My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . So um for them it was just how many devices control .
[13:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[13:31] Speaker_B | Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?"
"[13:34] Speaker_D | I think so . Yeah , yeah ."
[13:38] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[13:39] Speaker_D | Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,"
[13:52] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[14:03] Speaker_B | Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities ."
"[14:09] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah . An"
"[14:12] Speaker_D | Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there"
[14:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[14:33] Speaker_D | you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . But each one's got its own little"
[14:36] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[14:38] Speaker_D | part .
"[14:41] Speaker_B | Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?"
[15:03] Speaker_A | And you keep losing them .
[15:04] Speaker_B | You keep losing them . Okay .
[15:04] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[15:06] Speaker_A | Finding them is really a pain , you know . I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table ."
[15:07] Speaker_D | Mm . Mm .
[15:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
"[15:12] Speaker_B | Yeah . W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . There I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?"
[15:13] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:15] Speaker_A | You know .
[15:15] Speaker_D | That's just really good id
[15:19] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[15:24] Speaker_D | Uh , sure . I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S"
[15:36] Speaker_B | My goodness .
[15:46] Speaker_B | Still feels quite primitive .
[15:51] Speaker_B | Maybe like a touch screen or something ?
"[15:53] Speaker_D | Something like that , yeah . Or whatever would be technologically reasonable ."
[15:53] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[15:56] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer ."
"[15:57] Speaker_D | 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . Um , nicer materials and might be"
[16:01] Speaker_B | It looks better .
[16:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:11] Speaker_B | Okay .
[16:15] Speaker_B | Okay .
[16:15] Speaker_D | be worth exploring anyway .
[16:16] Speaker_C | Uh .
"[16:17] Speaker_B | Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive ,"
[16:33] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[16:50] Speaker_B | you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess ."
[16:59] Speaker_D | Okay .
[17:01] Speaker_B | Um .
"[17:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess ."
[17:14] Speaker_B | And uh
[17:16] Speaker_B | and that's the end of the meeting .
"[17:27] Speaker_D | Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , um , do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , right ? Well ,"
[17:29] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[17:36] Speaker_B | Uh-huh , yeah ."
[17:36] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:40] Speaker_D | are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? I I don't know .
"[17:56] Speaker_D | Yep . Yeah , sure ."
[18:01] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:04] Speaker_A | I think one factor would be production cost .
"[18:06] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah ."
"[18:07] Speaker_A | Because there's a cap there , so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um ."
[18:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:13] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:13] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:15] Speaker_A | I think that that's the main factor .
[18:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:18] Speaker_B | Okay . Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um ."
[18:18] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:24] Speaker_B | So , uh"

"[00:40] Speaker_A | Okay everybody is ready ? Good morning again . So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi . You're late . You have a good reason for that ? Very good . Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today ."
[00:48] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[01:19] Speaker_A | So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you ."
[01:50] Speaker_C | Yep .
[01:53] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yep .
"[01:55] Speaker_A | The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs ."
[02:01] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[02:05] Speaker_A | Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ?"
[02:35] Speaker_B | Uh the Powerstick .
[02:36] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[02:41] Speaker_A | What else ?
[02:45] Speaker_A | What else ?
[02:49] Speaker_B | Maybe a Spanish name would work well . Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there .
[02:57] Speaker_B | Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . Mando . What is that ?
[03:00] Speaker_D | Mando .
[03:02] Speaker_A | Mango ? Mango ? Mando . M_A_ ?
[03:04] Speaker_D | Mando .
[03:07] Speaker_A | M_A_ ?
[03:08] Speaker_D | A_N_ yeah D_O .
"[03:10] Speaker_A | M_ D_O_ . Mm , okay ."
[03:14] Speaker_A | What does it mean ?
[03:16] Speaker_A | Oh .
[03:19] Speaker_B | What does it mean in Spanish ?
[03:21] Speaker_D | Control .
[03:23] Speaker_A | Hmm . Nice .
"[03:28] Speaker_D | But mm , yeah . Mando sounds"
[03:37] Speaker_B | The Mando .
[03:37] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:42] Speaker_A | Yeah ? No objection ?
"[03:42] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah ."
[03:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:00] Speaker_C | Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . So we should be careful .
[04:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[04:04] Speaker_A | Okay , I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . Something that should be addressed later . We should we should go to other for the other topics ."
[04:06] Speaker_B | Marketing .
"[04:20] Speaker_A | Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ?"
[04:22] Speaker_B | Um .
[04:32] Speaker_D | Maybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah .
"[04:32] Speaker_A | So maybe we could start with the market , yeah ."
[04:37] Speaker_D | Mm . Okay .
[04:38] Speaker_A | Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?
[04:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:42] Speaker_D | Should be in participant four .
[04:45] Speaker_A | Participant four .
"[04:52] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah ."
[05:01] Speaker_D | Uh .
[05:08] Speaker_A | S that's coming . Uh okay . Great .
[05:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:12] Speaker_C | Yep .
[05:15] Speaker_D | Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .
[05:23] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[05:24] Speaker_D | For the functional requirements and especially for the
[05:28] Speaker_D | for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
"[05:44] Speaker_D | And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no"
[06:00] Speaker_D | no significant difference
[06:08] Speaker_A | Okay . Sh next slide ? Okay .
[06:09] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
"[06:12] Speaker_D | Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point ."
"[06:30] Speaker_D | Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old ."
"[06:50] Speaker_D | So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost ."
[07:20] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:21] Speaker_D | And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
[07:34] Speaker_A | Okay .
[07:37] Speaker_D | So in my opinion the
"[07:42] Speaker_D | Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . Liklier or more likely ? likely . Okay ."
[07:57] Speaker_D | Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but
"[08:37] Speaker_B | Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So"
[08:43] Speaker_B | unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
[08:50] Speaker_B | cut out some a lot of your market .
[08:53] Speaker_D | I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . Sorry ?
"[09:02] Speaker_C | Well maybe it could be a universal design . A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . Yeah ?"
[09:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[09:10] Speaker_B | Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?"
"[09:13] Speaker_C | That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?"
[09:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:24] Speaker_D | Sorry ?
"[09:24] Speaker_C | The first and the third point , they are clashing ."
"[09:26] Speaker_B | Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand ."
[09:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[09:29] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:30] Speaker_C | Okay . So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .
[09:30] Speaker_B | Uh .
"[09:34] Speaker_B | Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something ."
[09:38] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
"[09:43] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? Little sleek , longer ?"
[09:51] Speaker_C | And it should fit the hand .
[09:51] Speaker_D | No no I was thinking of so like something yeah .
[09:53] Speaker_A | Something with the shape of the palm ?
[09:56] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
[09:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:01] Speaker_A | On the sides .
[10:01] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah . It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . Not anymore . That's what yeah .
[10:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
"[10:09] Speaker_D | And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget"
[10:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:20] Speaker_D | would be large enough .
[10:24] Speaker_D | But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
"[10:33] Speaker_A | Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ ."
[10:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[10:56] Speaker_B | No .
[11:06] Speaker_D | Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls .
[11:10] Speaker_A | Excellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
"[11:21] Speaker_A | and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product ."
"[11:49] Speaker_A | Yeah yeah . Sure sure . So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco"
[11:53] Speaker_B | Yep . Okay .
"[12:10] Speaker_A | Sorry , what is your ?"
[12:12] Speaker_B | Uh participant three .
"[12:14] Speaker_B | You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so ."
"[12:17] Speaker_D | Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah . Yeah uh channel fifty ."
[12:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:28] Speaker_C | No it could be command control kind of thing . It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
"[12:36] Speaker_C | Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . Otherwise it's just lying idle ."
[12:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[12:53] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[13:00] Speaker_A | Okay Michael .
[13:04] Speaker_A | Sorry ?
[13:06] Speaker_A | Um yeah .
[13:07] Speaker_B | Mm . Thanks .
[13:11] Speaker_B | Okay .
[13:13] Speaker_A | The wheel doesn't work .
"[13:42] Speaker_B | So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh"
"[13:57] Speaker_B | mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons ."
"[14:15] Speaker_B | Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times ."
[14:55] Speaker_B | 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . Now um
[15:05] Speaker_C | Change the channels . Yeah .
"[15:10] Speaker_B | uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy ."
[15:21] Speaker_C | Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah yeah .
"[15:35] Speaker_B | Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability ."
[15:48] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[15:49] Speaker_B | One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but"
"[15:58] Speaker_B | one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel ."
"[16:19] Speaker_B | So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price ."
"[16:33] Speaker_B | So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions ."
[16:57] Speaker_B | It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .
[17:27] Speaker_C | But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . Because the same button is doing too many things .
[17:32] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[17:32] Speaker_B | Yeah well we w
"[17:35] Speaker_B | Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um"
[17:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:14] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:46] Speaker_C | It does sampling out of the .
[18:55] Speaker_D | If y
"[19:02] Speaker_A | Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?"
"[19:02] Speaker_B | So , but yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing ."
"[19:23] Speaker_B | Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well ."
[19:40] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[19:44] Speaker_B | And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room ."
"[20:16] Speaker_B | You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics ."
"[20:44] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay , thanks ."
[20:47] Speaker_C | Yep . So yeah .
"[20:55] Speaker_C | So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I yeah , it should be ."
[21:00] Speaker_A | This one ?
"[21:04] Speaker_A | Great . No , not that one ."
[21:09] Speaker_C | Two .
"[21:13] Speaker_C | Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can"
"[21:43] Speaker_C | it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing ."
"[21:52] Speaker_A | Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel ."
"[21:58] Speaker_C | That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces . Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking ."
[22:02] Speaker_A | Okay .
[22:21] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[22:28] Speaker_C | Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote ."
[22:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . That increases the the cost also .
[23:02] Speaker_C | Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that .
[23:09] Speaker_A | Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?
"[23:17] Speaker_C | Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough ."
[23:21] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[23:21] Speaker_C | Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc"
[23:27] Speaker_A | Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . So it could be s a few centimetres .
[23:28] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[23:33] Speaker_C | That's right .
[23:39] Speaker_C | That's right . That's right .
[23:52] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
"[23:55] Speaker_C | Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . So you have to store some templates on the on the"
"[24:06] Speaker_C | on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller ."
[24:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:13] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[24:16] Speaker_A | Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . Okay , next . Uh that finished ?"
"[24:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's right ."
[24:20] Speaker_C | Yeah . So we can
[24:24] Speaker_C | That's right . Yep .
[24:27] Speaker_C | Yep .
"[24:30] Speaker_C | No no . Components . Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there ."
[24:30] Speaker_A | No ? Components ?
"[25:05] Speaker_C | So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver ."
[25:28] Speaker_A | Okay .
[25:29] Speaker_C | So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in .
[25:35] Speaker_C | To have different technologies . So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . Yeah .
[25:56] Speaker_C | Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . So these are the slight problems .
[26:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:04] Speaker_A | So your
[26:06] Speaker_A | your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?
[26:17] Speaker_D | I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .
[26:28] Speaker_D | I'm sure .
[26:46] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:58] Speaker_B | Well it depends if it's a remote control th
"[27:00] Speaker_D | it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that ."
"[27:04] Speaker_B | Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be ."
[27:10] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
[27:20] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[27:30] Speaker_A | We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it ."
"[27:59] Speaker_A | And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_"
"[28:42] Speaker_B | Well it depends though well it depends . If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra"
[29:07] Speaker_B | cost .
[29:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[29:41] Speaker_A | Yeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?"
"[29:57] Speaker_B | For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible . But but I dunno , I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh"
[29:58] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[29:59] Speaker_C | It's not possible . It's impossible .
[30:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:27] Speaker_B | of increasing the unit price .
[30:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:36] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:40] Speaker_B | Yeah because yeah .
"[30:43] Speaker_D | Wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?"
[30:51] Speaker_B | Well th
[30:51] Speaker_D | What what kind of information ?
"[30:53] Speaker_B | 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide ."
[30:57] Speaker_D | Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the
[31:00] Speaker_A | They have tele teletext .
"[31:03] Speaker_A | Well , because they have teletext on it . Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel ."
[31:04] Speaker_D | the n
[31:12] Speaker_D | Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .
"[31:16] Speaker_A | They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . So to to uh"
[31:17] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:28] Speaker_B | You can get a lot more information on it .
[31:29] Speaker_A | to browse more easily the teletext .
[31:32] Speaker_A | For instance through uh through your remote control .
[31:37] Speaker_D | So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?
"[31:42] Speaker_B | So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to ."
"[31:44] Speaker_A | The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh o"
[31:52] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[31:57] Speaker_A | Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also ."
"[32:01] Speaker_B | Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . There's dependi it also depends on the country ."
[32:07] Speaker_A | Well because for the same reason that we cannot
[32:11] Speaker_A | uh informations on the T_V_ . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there .
[32:19] Speaker_B | No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .
[32:31] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:35] Speaker_B | Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . I dunno . We need to find that out ."
"[32:51] Speaker_C | But just a small thing , what kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . That is very important ."
[32:53] Speaker_A | Very quickly .
"[33:07] Speaker_A | No . Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . So this is that we z that that we should target ."
[33:07] Speaker_B | Mm . If it's a really small T_V_ maybe .
[33:14] Speaker_C | Broke . Okay . Okay .
[33:17] Speaker_C | Okay . Okay .
[33:20] Speaker_C | Okay . Okay .
"[33:23] Speaker_A | So the com the um the uh the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So"
[33:32] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[33:47] Speaker_D | I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ .
[33:50] Speaker_C | It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .
[33:57] Speaker_D | Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things . But
"[34:04] Speaker_D | for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . You just say channel fifty , and that's it ."
[34:04] Speaker_B | Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop
"[34:09] Speaker_B | I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know ."
"[34:21] Speaker_C | Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right ."
[34:28] Speaker_A | Okay this is this is an open question for you .
[34:38] Speaker_D | To move to another target ?
[34:53] Speaker_A | It's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard .
[35:04] Speaker_B | Ninety five percent is not good enough though .
"[35:04] Speaker_A | Well this is still is is very bad . So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um so you have to work on the component uh concept . Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching ."
[35:19] Speaker_C | Okay .
[35:26] Speaker_A | Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .
[35:34] Speaker_A | Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks . Bye .
[35:41] Speaker_B | Yep .

[00:06] Speaker_B | Here we go again .
"[00:25] Speaker_C | My mouse is not working anymore . He's uh when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep ."
[00:28] Speaker_D | Oh .
[00:29] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[00:34] Speaker_D | Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here ."
[00:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[00:48] Speaker_B | Mm , okay ."
[00:48] Speaker_A | Everybody ready ?
"[00:50] Speaker_B | Yeah , it's okay ."
"[00:50] Speaker_A | Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten ."
"[00:57] Speaker_A | Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes ."
[01:13] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[01:14] Speaker_A | Oh , well this is the the closing already . So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then ."
[01:22] Speaker_B | Okay .
[01:29] Speaker_B | No .
[01:30] Speaker_C | Huh .
[01:32] Speaker_A | Oh that . It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
"[01:36] Speaker_C | Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ?"
[01:36] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
[01:38] Speaker_A | Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . You've already done that ?
[01:40] Speaker_B | In project .
"[01:41] Speaker_C | Okay , I've done that ."
[01:44] Speaker_B | No can that open .
[01:44] Speaker_C | Yes .
[01:48] Speaker_A | Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .
[01:50] Speaker_B | Open it there .
"[01:53] Speaker_A | Uh , well . Yes ."
[01:58] Speaker_A | Uh-oh . New thing .
"[02:02] Speaker_A | Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time ."
[02:12] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[02:14] Speaker_B | Okay .
[02:17] Speaker_A | And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .
"[02:22] Speaker_C | 'Kay , we're going to um"
"[02:25] Speaker_C | uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit"
[02:39] Speaker_C | which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .
"[02:49] Speaker_C | Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology ."
"[02:58] Speaker_C | Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um ,"
"[03:16] Speaker_C | Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh"
[03:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[03:55] Speaker_C | Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,"
[03:59] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[04:06] Speaker_C | I haven't come to here , but"
[04:10] Speaker_C | um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
[04:21] Speaker_C | just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here .
[04:39] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[04:41] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then ."
[04:46] Speaker_B | Okay .
[04:49] Speaker_A | But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?
[04:56] Speaker_C | Yes .
[04:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[04:57] Speaker_B | But nothing restricted for user interface ?
[05:01] Speaker_A | Yeah . M
"[05:01] Speaker_C | Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah ."
[05:02] Speaker_B | I don't know .
[05:04] Speaker_A | Okay .
[05:09] Speaker_B | 'Kay .
[05:09] Speaker_C | Remote control is nothing special nowadays .
[05:12] Speaker_A | R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .
[05:12] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[05:19] Speaker_C | I don't think so , because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?"
"[05:20] Speaker_A | Okay . Yeah , okay ."
[05:21] Speaker_B | Yes .
[05:30] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[05:35] Speaker_A | Well , we'll see . We'll see later on ."
"[05:38] Speaker_B | Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user ."
[05:45] Speaker_A | No .
[05:46] Speaker_C | No .
"[06:05] Speaker_A | Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah ."
"[06:09] Speaker_B | Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control ."
"[06:17] Speaker_A | Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on ."
"[06:19] Speaker_B | Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it ."
[06:26] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[06:28] Speaker_A | Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? Well , what that's what you want trying to say ."
"[06:38] Speaker_D | Yes , I agree . Yeah ."
"[06:42] Speaker_B | Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use ."
[06:52] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:53] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:56] Speaker_A | Yeah , well some of these Uh , yeah ."
"[07:04] Speaker_A | Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements ."
"[07:10] Speaker_B | Yeah , probably , yeah ."
[07:10] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[07:13] Speaker_B | Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can user requirements what we need more ."
[07:37] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
"[07:48] Speaker_B | Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that ."
[07:56] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[08:08] Speaker_B | M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think ."
[08:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[08:20] Speaker_D | Design .
[08:24] Speaker_D | Sounds interesting .
[08:26] Speaker_B | Yeah ?
"[08:27] Speaker_B | Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think ."
[08:29] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[08:30] Speaker_B | Yeah , that was it ."
"[08:32] Speaker_A | Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market ."
"[08:47] Speaker_D | Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um yes ."
"[08:54] Speaker_D | The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh"
"[09:02] Speaker_D | how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach ."
"[09:48] Speaker_D | Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,"
[10:33] Speaker_D | uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But
"[10:42] Speaker_D | it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls ."
"[11:22] Speaker_D | So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used ,"
[11:51] Speaker_D | we could group them uh on one button
"[11:55] Speaker_D | and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say ,"
[12:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:30] Speaker_A | Visually presents .
"[12:32] Speaker_D | Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent ."
[12:51] Speaker_D | That was kind of what I found .
"[12:53] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think ."
[12:54] Speaker_B | Okay .
[13:16] Speaker_A | Because um
[13:20] Speaker_A | uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward .
"[13:25] Speaker_A | Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange ."
"[13:29] Speaker_A | Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely ."
[13:39] Speaker_B | No way .
"[13:52] Speaker_D | Not too much , no ."
[14:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[14:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:19] Speaker_A | I don't know . I think that uh
[14:33] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[14:41] Speaker_D | I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Mayb yeah ?"
"[14:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's"
"[15:12] Speaker_A | what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think , yeah ."
"[15:15] Speaker_D | Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright ."
"[15:17] Speaker_A | Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can"
"[15:26] Speaker_A | make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , something else nice to know ."
[15:32] Speaker_D | Yes .
[15:43] Speaker_B | But what's our slogan ?
[15:53] Speaker_D | We put the fashion in electronics .
"[16:03] Speaker_A | Okay well , let's go back to the"
[16:08] Speaker_A | the agenda .
[16:11] Speaker_A | So we've now had to the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements .
[16:40] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[16:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[16:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:01] Speaker_B | Yeah , but wha"
"[17:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma"
"[17:23] Speaker_B | Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . So why should j we put this function in ? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions ."
[17:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[17:45] Speaker_A | Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,"
[17:48] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[18:15] Speaker_A | you know , they want to uh"
"[18:15] Speaker_D | Yeah , control ."
"[18:16] Speaker_B | Yeah , but uh you said Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making ."
"[18:17] Speaker_A | control , remotely ."
[18:24] Speaker_B | It's n
[18:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[18:34] Speaker_A | Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ?"
[18:43] Speaker_C | But you can put them under the same button .
[18:43] Speaker_D | Not much more than that .
"[18:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , if as far as possible ."
[18:46] Speaker_D | Yep .
[18:48] Speaker_D | Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .
[18:52] Speaker_D | So t
"[18:52] Speaker_A | But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? No , you don't think so ? Yeah , the new requirements say so ."
[18:59] Speaker_B | No .
"[19:00] Speaker_B | No , new requirements say no ."
[19:04] Speaker_C | But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .
[19:17] Speaker_D | Y yes .
"[19:18] Speaker_B | I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions ."
[19:23] Speaker_A | That's that's wha
"[19:24] Speaker_D | But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward ."
"[19:35] Speaker_A | No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . No , no ."
"[19:35] Speaker_B | No , no . Exactly ."
[19:36] Speaker_C | Huh .
"[19:40] Speaker_A | Okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then ."
"[19:53] Speaker_B | Mm , yeah ."
[20:08] Speaker_B | keep it simple and look more at th
"[20:10] Speaker_A | And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more ."
[20:15] Speaker_B | No .
[20:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , nothing more . Exactly ."
[20:31] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:32] Speaker_D | Alright .
"[20:33] Speaker_A | Um , but what televis"
"[20:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels ."
"[20:54] Speaker_B | And the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah ."
"[20:59] Speaker_A | Uh ,"
[20:59] Speaker_B | It's too much integrated in the other .
"[21:00] Speaker_A | Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off ."
[21:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[21:06] Speaker_A | Probably .
"[21:06] Speaker_D | Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,"
"[21:19] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
"[21:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then ."
"[21:30] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And"
"[21:36] Speaker_A | we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . I don't know what you th guys think ."
[21:37] Speaker_B | Look at the market .
[21:50] Speaker_D | Might be . Might be .
[22:02] Speaker_A | I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .
"[22:04] Speaker_B | Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th"
[22:14] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:15] Speaker_A | Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements ."
"[22:19] Speaker_C | Yes , but you could put"
"[22:22] Speaker_C | on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down ."
"[22:27] Speaker_A | Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements ."
[22:31] Speaker_C | Yes .
[22:34] Speaker_B | True .
"[22:41] Speaker_A | we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess ."
[22:46] Speaker_B | A simple yeah .
"[22:49] Speaker_A | Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ?"
[22:57] Speaker_A | Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want .
[23:05] Speaker_A | We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d
"[23:10] Speaker_D | I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep ."
[23:10] Speaker_C | Yes .
[23:11] Speaker_A | Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .
"[23:13] Speaker_B | But trendy , yeah . I don't know ."
"[23:15] Speaker_A | Or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ?"
[23:17] Speaker_C | Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .
"[23:20] Speaker_A | Yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly ."
[23:30] Speaker_D | Yep .
[23:31] Speaker_B | True .
"[23:35] Speaker_A | Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace ."
[23:44] Speaker_D | Yes .
"[23:45] Speaker_A | Oh , what should we decide on then ?"
"[23:50] Speaker_A | I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then ."
[23:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[23:58] Speaker_C | No , it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest ."
[24:01] Speaker_A | Yep .
"[24:04] Speaker_A | No , okay , but we don't have to uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple ."
[24:10] Speaker_C | No .
[24:11] Speaker_B | Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
[24:17] Speaker_C | The most standard batteries .
[24:17] Speaker_A | I think
"[24:19] Speaker_A | I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well , it has to be simple , and I wi"
[24:19] Speaker_D | I think double A_ .
[24:22] Speaker_D | Yep .
[24:27] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:27] Speaker_D | The most ordinary uh batteries .
"[24:28] Speaker_A | Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know ."
[24:31] Speaker_B | Okay .
[24:32] Speaker_D | Yep .
[24:40] Speaker_C | But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .
[24:41] Speaker_B | Early break .
"[24:48] Speaker_A | Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing ."
[24:53] Speaker_C | Maybe th m
[25:08] Speaker_B | To find him . That's maybe yeah .
[25:09] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep ."
[25:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[25:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , but the well , it's already been done ."
"[25:52] Speaker_B | Yeah , but that's yeah ."
"[25:55] Speaker_A | Nah . Yeah , that's true . But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know ."
[26:02] Speaker_D | Yes .
[26:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:09] Speaker_D | Yep .
"[26:20] Speaker_D | No , that's true ."
"[26:22] Speaker_A | So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing ."
"[26:34] Speaker_B | Be original , yeah ."
"[26:40] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah ."
[26:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:47] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[26:51] Speaker_B | Must brain-storm .
[26:51] Speaker_A | Uh-huh .
"[26:51] Speaker_D | Yeah , a swapable front or whatever ."
[27:04] Speaker_B | More money for us .
[27:07] Speaker_A | But it and I think we have to make it quite big .
[27:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:10] Speaker_B | Quite big . Yeah , you think ?"
"[27:10] Speaker_D | Yes , definitely , definitely ."
[27:12] Speaker_C | That's to be uh a formed for your hand .
"[27:20] Speaker_D | Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o"
[27:26] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[27:33] Speaker_B | A standard or something .
[27:35] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[27:39] Speaker_D | A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah ."
[27:41] Speaker_C | More like a joystick then .
"[27:44] Speaker_D | Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep ."
[27:46] Speaker_B | It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .
"[27:49] Speaker_D | If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? Uh fifty percent"
[27:52] Speaker_A | That it's it's fashionable .
"[28:04] Speaker_A | Oh , yeah ."
[28:14] Speaker_D | fifty percent often loses remote control .
"[28:21] Speaker_D | No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in ."
"[28:23] Speaker_A | Oh , okay ."
[28:23] Speaker_B | On the television .
"[28:26] Speaker_B | Oh , like this ."
[28:33] Speaker_B | A char chargeable . Yeah .
"[28:36] Speaker_A | Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units ."
[28:39] Speaker_B | Why not .
[28:50] Speaker_C | With recharger .
"[28:56] Speaker_D | It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?"
"[28:59] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen"
[29:00] Speaker_B | Production .
[29:06] Speaker_B | It should be possible . I think it's a good idea .
[29:06] Speaker_A | Uh I I think it's a great idea .
[29:09] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[29:09] Speaker_A | S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays ."
[29:10] Speaker_B | To make a base or something ?
"[29:16] Speaker_D | Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah ."
"[29:18] Speaker_C | Yes , but is that handy ?"
[29:24] Speaker_B | It's it's it's it's
"[29:26] Speaker_C | But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries ."
"[29:26] Speaker_B | it's not the purpose to be handy , it's"
"[29:47] Speaker_D | Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know ."
"[29:50] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah , but that's not it's ugly , I think ."
"[29:51] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah ."
"[29:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it ."
[30:00] Speaker_B | No .
"[30:36] Speaker_D | Sure , why not . Yep ."
[30:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:45] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[30:46] Speaker_B | True .
[30:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[30:50] Speaker_D | Definitely .
"[30:54] Speaker_D | With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely ."
"[30:57] Speaker_A | Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing ."
[31:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[31:06] Speaker_B | Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have ."
"[31:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice ."
"[31:09] Speaker_D | Definitely , yeah ."
[31:16] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , we c"
"[31:46] Speaker_D | Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes ."
"[31:49] Speaker_A | Yeah , okay ."
"[31:52] Speaker_A | So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi"
[31:58] Speaker_B | Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .
"[32:02] Speaker_D | Yeah , why not ."
"[32:02] Speaker_A | Yeah . But it's also annoying . 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Then it beeps all the time and . You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it ."
[32:07] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[32:09] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[32:12] Speaker_D | No , that's true ."
[32:24] Speaker_D | Why not .
[32:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[32:51] Speaker_D | Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah ."
[32:53] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[32:56] Speaker_D | No . Nearly .
[32:56] Speaker_B | And you can leave it just there .
"[32:57] Speaker_A | M maybe we should really do this . Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . Oh , now I've put uh well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?"
"[33:12] Speaker_D | Something like that , yeah ."
"[33:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think ."
[33:16] Speaker_B | Uh fifteen minutes .
"[33:19] Speaker_A | We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some oh ."
[33:25] Speaker_A | There is a closing sheet .
"[33:28] Speaker_A | We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work ."
[33:31] Speaker_D | Oh .
[33:49] Speaker_B | Can you make an uh uh
[33:52] Speaker_B | a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? That not not everything in one one uh folder .
"[33:56] Speaker_D | Maarten , five minutes ."
"[33:58] Speaker_A | Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen ."
[34:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[34:19] Speaker_B | Maybe .
"[34:20] Speaker_D | No , that's true uh , yeah ."
[34:27] Speaker_D | Should we by the way draw um
"[34:31] Speaker_D | on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of yeah ."
[34:35] Speaker_A | Of the shape .
[34:37] Speaker_B | Or the sh
"[34:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , probably , it would be nice ."
"[34:37] Speaker_D | I dunno . Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? I don't , for one ."
[34:41] Speaker_B | Do you get an idea of the shape ?
[34:45] Speaker_C | Maybe like this pen .
"[34:48] Speaker_A | No , bigger ."
"[34:52] Speaker_D | The shape is nice , it's um"
"[34:54] Speaker_D | something different , and we want we want that . Yeah ."
[34:56] Speaker_C | It has to feel nice in your hand .
"[34:57] Speaker_A | Well , I I I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it ."
"[35:06] Speaker_B | Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures ."
[35:17] Speaker_A | That would also be nice .
[35:19] Speaker_A | But that's gonna then you c then you don't
"[35:21] Speaker_A | Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive ."
"[35:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true ."
[35:44] Speaker_A | Would be a nice idea though .
[35:47] Speaker_A | I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something .
[35:53] Speaker_A | Like something like that or so or so
[35:55] Speaker_D | Something like that is very ergonomic .
[35:57] Speaker_A | And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .
[36:04] Speaker_A | Put it in there uh wire on it .
"[36:07] Speaker_A | Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well ."
"[36:13] Speaker_B | Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that ."
"[36:15] Speaker_A | Volume and programme , yeah ."
"[36:16] Speaker_D | Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part ."
[36:20] Speaker_A | And some of the extra funct
[36:22] Speaker_A | Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers .
[36:23] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[36:24] Speaker_D | Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess ."
[36:26] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[36:26] Speaker_A | And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it ."
[36:32] Speaker_D | Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry .
"[36:34] Speaker_B | Yeah , side of it . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah ."
[36:35] Speaker_A | Along the side uh strip of yeah .
"[36:43] Speaker_A | Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote ."
[36:44] Speaker_D | Oh .
[36:51] Speaker_D | Okay .
[36:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[36:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[36:54] Speaker_B | Well , uh probably at the side ."
"[36:58] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that ."
"[37:05] Speaker_B | Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah ."
[37:05] Speaker_A | And then you have
[37:07] Speaker_A | a strip of uh lights or something .
"[37:08] Speaker_B | Yeah , something like that , yeah ."
"[37:08] Speaker_D | Okay , yeah ."
"[37:12] Speaker_A | Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . I don't know ."
[37:21] Speaker_A | Or some bump . Maybe some Yeah ?
[37:21] Speaker_D | I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .
[37:25] Speaker_B | Bumper or something .
[37:26] Speaker_A | We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done .
[37:28] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[37:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:31] Speaker_A | We can save this one .
[37:31] Speaker_B | Lunch break .
[37:33] Speaker_B | Okay then .

"[00:06] Speaker_D | Mm , don't think so ."
[00:08] Speaker_A | Okay .
[00:10] Speaker_D | Unless uh things have suddenly change again .
[00:13] Speaker_A | Is it much changes ?
"[00:15] Speaker_D | Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time ."
[00:22] Speaker_A | Only the same information .
"[01:29] Speaker_A | Hello , Sebastian ."
[01:31] Speaker_C | Hello hello Mister P_M_ .
"[01:37] Speaker_A | I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room ."
"[01:51] Speaker_A | Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . Bongiorno ."
[01:56] Speaker_B | Bongiorno .
[02:02] Speaker_A | I see some interesting okay .
"[02:11] Speaker_A | The third meeting . Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?"
[02:12] Speaker_D | Oop .
"[02:32] Speaker_A | If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . Um the second thing , um"
[02:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:02] Speaker_A | That's quite strange .
[03:06] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[03:07] Speaker_A | Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think . Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?"
[03:20] Speaker_B | No .
[03:20] Speaker_C | Not at all .
[03:20] Speaker_D | No .
"[03:20] Speaker_A | Okay . Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation ."
[03:42] Speaker_C | Okay .
[03:52] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[03:56] Speaker_D | Hmm ?
[03:57] Speaker_B | Alright .
[03:58] Speaker_D | Oh .
"[04:15] Speaker_C | Just press the okay button , it works ."
[04:20] Speaker_D | Okay .
[04:23] Speaker_A | Um yeah .
[04:24] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
"[04:36] Speaker_D | Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables"
"[04:55] Speaker_D | in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material ."
[05:01] Speaker_D | Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
[05:05] Speaker_D | Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . But we since we are concentrating on uh
[05:14] Speaker_C | Oh wait uh wait up .
[05:22] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[05:28] Speaker_C | Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
"[05:38] Speaker_D | Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something ."
[05:47] Speaker_C | Not something dull .
[05:50] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[05:50] Speaker_B | But they like dark colours , you said in the p"
"[05:52] Speaker_D | No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful"
[05:56] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[06:03] Speaker_C | But can you can you go back to that slide ? The uh just one slide back , no no no ."
[06:06] Speaker_D | Which one ? This ?
[06:10] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[06:12] Speaker_C | Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy ."
[06:16] Speaker_D | Yes .
[06:33] Speaker_D | Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
"[06:36] Speaker_A | Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it maybe it rubber or or yeah . Okay ."
"[06:42] Speaker_D | Yeah , exactly ."
"[06:46] Speaker_D | Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood ,"
[06:48] Speaker_B | Or we could make oh .
"[06:58] Speaker_D | Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group ,"
[07:06] Speaker_D | I think we should use soft materials
"[07:09] Speaker_D | and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers ."
[07:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:18] Speaker_D | So we could provide
[07:21] Speaker_D | both for the young and the old what they like .
"[07:25] Speaker_A | Well , that's interesting ."
"[07:28] Speaker_A | You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover ."
"[07:30] Speaker_B | Yeah , o o"
[07:33] Speaker_C | Yes .
[07:33] Speaker_B | I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . It's the it's the rubber uh
"[07:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah ."
"[07:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , it is , it is i yeah ."
"[07:44] Speaker_B | cover . And it's uh colourful . It looks likes a banana . We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design ."
[07:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[07:51] Speaker_A | Do you know the phone ?
"[07:52] Speaker_C | I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it ."
[07:55] Speaker_B | Um thirty five .
"[07:58] Speaker_C | Oh , that one , yes . Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know ."
[07:59] Speaker_B | And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow .
"[08:03] Speaker_C | Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it ."
"[08:04] Speaker_A | You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th"
"[08:08] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay . Um uh okay . Do you have uh thit that was Okay . Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . Okay ."
[08:13] Speaker_D | 'Kay . Uh that's about it .
[08:23] Speaker_D | Yes .
[08:28] Speaker_D | Uh soft material .
"[08:31] Speaker_C | So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?"
[08:40] Speaker_D | Uh the fancy look and feel .
[08:42] Speaker_C | Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .
[08:44] Speaker_D | Yes . Apparently .
"[08:52] Speaker_A | Okay , Roo ,"
[08:55] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[08:56] Speaker_A | could you do your presentation ?
[08:58] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[09:03] Speaker_B | Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh"
[09:12] Speaker_B | the previous uh discussion .
"[09:20] Speaker_A | Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about ."
[09:52] Speaker_A | Shape .
[09:52] Speaker_B | shape . So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um
[10:14] Speaker_B | PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
"[10:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good ."
[10:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[10:38] Speaker_C | Yes .
[10:43] Speaker_C | Slippery .
"[10:47] Speaker_B | But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed ."
[10:47] Speaker_C | You have to grab it .
"[10:50] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah , exactly ."
[10:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[10:53] Speaker_C | Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . So m"
"[10:58] Speaker_A | Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah ."
[11:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[11:07] Speaker_A | Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , okay ."
[11:10] Speaker_C | Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
"[11:14] Speaker_A | Okay , good ."
"[11:24] Speaker_B | Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah ."
"[11:47] Speaker_A | Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , yeah ."
"[11:51] Speaker_B | So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um"
"[11:59] Speaker_A | Okay , b but I think we'll yeah ."
[11:59] Speaker_B | thirty c uh controls on it .
"[11:59] Speaker_C | Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing ."
[12:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:05] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:07] Speaker_B | Right .
"[13:14] Speaker_C | it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d"
"[14:08] Speaker_C | It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing ."
[14:22] Speaker_B | Like the watch .
[14:46] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:48] Speaker_C | It's very funny indeed .
[14:52] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:55] Speaker_C | Indeed .
"[14:56] Speaker_B | But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch ."
"[15:01] Speaker_A | Well , maybe m"
"[15:06] Speaker_A | Yeah , I know ."
"[15:06] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yes . But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind ."
[15:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:37] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:39] Speaker_A | And wha
[15:46] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[15:48] Speaker_C | So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries ."
[15:56] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[16:02] Speaker_A | Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Yeah ."
"[16:06] Speaker_C | Uh yes , it does . I'll come to that later . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it ."
[16:10] Speaker_A | Okay .
[16:52] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[17:17] Speaker_B | Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round ."
[17:22] Speaker_C | Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
[17:25] Speaker_B | But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
[17:29] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[17:40] Speaker_C | Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions ."
"[17:46] Speaker_A | This will be the remote , right ? Um with uh maybe a channel selector ."
[17:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[17:53] Speaker_A | What about
[17:55] Speaker_A | integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
"[17:57] Speaker_C | Uh it's do it's done before . Yes . It's quite quite good , yes ."
"[18:01] Speaker_B | But Flores ,"
[18:07] Speaker_A | Volume ?
"[18:08] Speaker_C | Well , it's it well , i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel ."
"[18:11] Speaker_B | A volume , okay ."
"[18:18] Speaker_A | Well , what about mute ?"
"[18:20] Speaker_C | About mute . Well , yes ."
[18:23] Speaker_C | Okay .
[18:24] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[18:26] Speaker_C | Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay ."
[18:29] Speaker_A | And click it to muten the device .
"[18:32] Speaker_C | Well , okay . It's quite goods ."
[18:33] Speaker_A | And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to
"[18:42] Speaker_A | uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel ."
[18:44] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Yes .
[18:50] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:57] Speaker_B | Wheel .
"[18:59] Speaker_D | Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers ."
[19:07] Speaker_A | Okay .
[19:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[19:17] Speaker_C | Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So maybe it's not no"
"[19:22] Speaker_A | Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this ."
[19:35] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[19:37] Speaker_C | Yes , but it uses two separate buttons ."
"[19:39] Speaker_A | Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah ."
"[19:45] Speaker_A | For you too , yeah ."
"[19:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect ."
"[19:59] Speaker_C | Wi within reach . Yes , you have to ."
[20:02] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[20:05] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation ."
[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:08] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Okay .
[21:11] Speaker_C | Okay . So so okay .
[21:21] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[21:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:34] Speaker_C | Okay .
[21:37] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[21:41] Speaker_A | It performs the action . Yeah .
"[21:42] Speaker_B | Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function ."
[21:43] Speaker_C | Okay .
[21:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:27] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display ?
[22:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[22:32] Speaker_C | Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here"
"[22:36] Speaker_B | Yeah . Well , I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display . Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , yeah ."
[22:37] Speaker_C | to think about .
[22:47] Speaker_A | No .
[22:47] Speaker_C | I I don't think either .
[22:50] Speaker_C | No . I don't think you need it .
[22:56] Speaker_A | On screen display . Yeah . Okay th
[23:29] Speaker_A | Okay . Good .
[23:31] Speaker_A | Kineti okay .
[23:33] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[23:40] Speaker_A | Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , too yeah ."
"[23:52] Speaker_A | Yeah , but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different ."
[23:54] Speaker_C | Yes . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh
[23:56] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay .
[23:57] Speaker_B | But what about um the markets
[23:58] Speaker_C | Uh it's more functional .
[24:08] Speaker_C | The titanium thing uh
[24:12] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[24:15] Speaker_B | Oh , sorry . Yeah ."
"[24:15] Speaker_C | So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that ."
[24:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:21] Speaker_D | And yeah , the yeah , the older people liked wood ."
"[24:22] Speaker_A | No , r rubber with colours ."
"[24:25] Speaker_C | Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber ."
"[24:28] Speaker_D | Yeah , the younger people liked soft material ."
[24:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
[24:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:41] Speaker_B | And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
"[24:46] Speaker_B | Okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh , evalu"
[25:03] Speaker_A | I it's too dull . Yeah .
[25:05] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[25:17] Speaker_A | Okay . Okay .
"[25:21] Speaker_A | Okay , what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour"
[25:35] Speaker_C | Yes .
[25:37] Speaker_C | It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . It's very unlogical .
[25:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[25:57] Speaker_B | Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . Yeah ."
"[26:03] Speaker_A | Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue ."
"[26:13] Speaker_C | All lights get absorbed , yeah ."
"[26:23] Speaker_C | Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . So it has an it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker ."
[26:25] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:39] Speaker_C | Um with a with a regular chip .
[26:40] Speaker_B | And the regular chip .
[26:44] Speaker_B | And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .
[26:51] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:54] Speaker_B | No . Think so too .
[26:56] Speaker_C | Okay .
[27:02] Speaker_C | Technology .
[27:04] Speaker_C | Yes . It's not very flashy and new .
[27:12] Speaker_D | Standard ?
"[27:15] Speaker_A | Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem . Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because"
[27:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:26] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[27:30] Speaker_A | it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .
[27:32] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[27:35] Speaker_B | But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber ,"
[27:39] Speaker_A | Mm yeah .
[27:41] Speaker_C | Uh I think our customers will go insane . It's it's too much .
[27:42] Speaker_B | the fancy colours .
"[27:43] Speaker_A | Okay , okay ."
"[27:45] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to"
"[27:58] Speaker_D | Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M"
[28:03] Speaker_B | Um no .
[28:06] Speaker_B | Nothing more .
[28:10] Speaker_C | Okay .
[28:12] Speaker_C | Uh the n the next phase will be um
[28:16] Speaker_C | the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ?
[28:24] Speaker_C | Okay .
[28:26] Speaker_C | So i
[28:28] Speaker_C | Okay .
[28:30] Speaker_C | Okay .
[28:31] Speaker_A | The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . User interface um
"[28:34] Speaker_C | Okay , okay ."
"[28:39] Speaker_B | Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay . Sorry , yeah ."
"[28:44] Speaker_C | Yes , they can work . They cannot work with double-curved . That's that's problem . I'll check it for you ."
"[28:47] Speaker_B | Oh , sorry . Yeah ."
"[28:49] Speaker_A | Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow ."
[29:01] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[29:10] Speaker_C | Yes .
[29:16] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[29:36] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[29:46] Speaker_A | Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready ."
"[29:49] Speaker_B | Yeah , right ."
[29:52] Speaker_C | Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
[29:59] Speaker_C | I'll do .
[30:06] Speaker_C | Okay . W start with the casing .
"[30:09] Speaker_A | The casing is curved , single-curved ."
[30:10] Speaker_B | Single-curved .
"[30:11] Speaker_C | Okay , single-curved case . Okay ."
[30:15] Speaker_C | What about the energy source ?
[30:17] Speaker_A | Traditional batteries uh and solar .
[30:19] Speaker_B | But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah ?
[30:27] Speaker_C | I I think they can . Yes .
[30:29] Speaker_B | Okay . What if not ?
[30:35] Speaker_B | Okay .
"[30:38] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay , um th"
[30:40] Speaker_C | So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . Okay .
"[30:43] Speaker_A | Battery and solar , yeah ."
[30:48] Speaker_C | What about uh the finishing of the case ?
[30:51] Speaker_C | We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
"[30:54] Speaker_A | Yeah , with colourful rubber . Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish ."
[30:54] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[31:06] Speaker_C | Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow ."
[31:13] Speaker_A | Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .
[31:14] Speaker_B | Grey and yellow .
"[31:15] Speaker_C | Grey yellow , okay ."
"[31:15] Speaker_B | Yellow case and grey buttons , I think ."
"[31:18] Speaker_A | Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours ."
[31:18] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[31:27] Speaker_C | Oh , I think it's uh it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?"
"[31:36] Speaker_A | Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before ."
[31:40] Speaker_B | But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button .
"[31:48] Speaker_A | Well , it it doesn't have to be red ."
"[31:51] Speaker_A | Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess ."
[32:00] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[32:06] Speaker_C | Okay .
[32:12] Speaker_D | Or black and yellow .
"[32:13] Speaker_A | Black and yellow , yeah ."
"[32:36] Speaker_C | Oh , I've read . Yes ."
[32:36] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[32:39] Speaker_C | Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques ."
"[32:46] Speaker_A | Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here ."
[32:49] Speaker_C | So I'm afraid it's not possible .
[33:03] Speaker_B | A scroll-wheel .
"[33:04] Speaker_A | The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided ."
"[33:07] Speaker_B | Voice recognition , of course ."
"[33:08] Speaker_C | Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . And th the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too ."
[33:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[33:24] Speaker_B | What what did you say ?
"[33:25] Speaker_C | Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So I I think that's okay ."
[33:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[33:35] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[33:38] Speaker_B | Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons ."
[33:42] Speaker_B | In the rubber .
"[33:53] Speaker_B | Yeah , b"
[33:54] Speaker_B | But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
"[34:04] Speaker_B | What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber ."
[34:12] Speaker_A | Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ?
[34:19] Speaker_D | Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
[34:30] Speaker_A | Yeah . You could place a um uh this this would be the button .
[34:33] Speaker_D | There the icons .
"[34:36] Speaker_A | The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place"
"[34:38] Speaker_B | Yeah , b yeah ."
[34:40] Speaker_C | Yes .
[34:42] Speaker_D | So you don't touch the icons that much .
[34:43] Speaker_C | That's okay .
"[34:43] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case ."
"[34:50] Speaker_B | So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting ."
[35:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[35:04] Speaker_A | But it's into the rubber .
"[35:05] Speaker_B | Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus ."
"[35:08] Speaker_C | Yes , the signs ."
"[35:08] Speaker_A | Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . What about um making this rubber"
[35:14] Speaker_B | You just move the problem .
[35:20] Speaker_A | and making this plastic ?
[35:23] Speaker_C | Uh I see what you mean .
"[35:25] Speaker_C | Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two ."
"[35:37] Speaker_A | Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . But the front ,"
[35:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[35:55] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[35:57] Speaker_C | Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be"
"[36:01] Speaker_C | Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber ."
"[36:21] Speaker_A | I mean , I I never touch between the buttons ."
[36:24] Speaker_B | I do . Or the s uh the sideways . Or the the back . Or the back .
[36:24] Speaker_C | I do .
"[36:27] Speaker_A | Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ?"
"[36:34] Speaker_B | Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it ."
"[36:45] Speaker_A | Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?"
[36:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:03] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[37:03] Speaker_C | Okay .
[37:09] Speaker_C | Um not quite . Um what about
[37:15] Speaker_C | uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? Okay .
[37:20] Speaker_B | Regular .
[37:21] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[37:26] Speaker_B | Use with .
"[37:27] Speaker_C | Well no , I think that's about it ."
[37:31] Speaker_C | Yes .
"[37:46] Speaker_A | Okay , well ."
"[37:48] Speaker_A | Yeah . Okay . Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished ."
[38:02] Speaker_B | For the finishing touch .
"[38:03] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?"
[38:04] Speaker_C | Okay .
[38:08] Speaker_C | Okay .
[38:09] Speaker_B | Uh yeah .
[38:10] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[38:11] Speaker_B | But um

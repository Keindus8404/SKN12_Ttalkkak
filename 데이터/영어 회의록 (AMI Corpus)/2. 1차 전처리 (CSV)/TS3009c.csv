"[00:37] Speaker_A | Okay . Uh door is closed . Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda ."
[00:43] Speaker_D | I'm listening .
[00:46] Speaker_D | Right .
[00:51] Speaker_D | Great .
[00:57] Speaker_A | Yo .
[01:01] Speaker_A | So . Uh This one I think . Uh yeah . Well alright .
"[01:27] Speaker_A | Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again ."
[01:31] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:46] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[01:49] Speaker_A | Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?"
[01:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[01:56] Speaker_A | Walter will uh start again this time ?
"[01:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , great ."
[02:00] Speaker_A | Yo .
"[02:00] Speaker_D | Alright , Trendwatch ."
[02:03] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[02:17] Speaker_D | Right .
"[02:21] Speaker_D | I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling ."
[02:28] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[02:36] Speaker_D | Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great ."
[02:50] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . Alright .
[02:58] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[02:58] Speaker_D | Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too ."
"[03:22] Speaker_A | Well , yeah ."
[03:27] Speaker_A | L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .
[03:31] Speaker_D | Right . Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . Yeah ?
[03:40] Speaker_C | Easy to use ? I think that's your ta
"[03:48] Speaker_D | Yeah , I know ."
[03:52] Speaker_D | I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So we have to uh take that one .
[03:54] Speaker_C | Mm .
[03:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:59] Speaker_D | So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . But it has to look great .
[04:04] Speaker_B | Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
[04:08] Speaker_A | Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh .
"[04:11] Speaker_C | You Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device ."
"[04:17] Speaker_D | Yeah , right ."
"[04:19] Speaker_D | But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept . Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . So it must be very bright , very colourful . People like this ."
[04:26] Speaker_C | Alright .
[04:26] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[04:50] Speaker_D | The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public ."
[05:02] Speaker_B | Bananas .
[05:12] Speaker_C | Mm .
[05:13] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[05:20] Speaker_A | Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different .
"[05:26] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's great . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily ."
[05:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[05:32] Speaker_A | Yes .
[05:38] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[05:38] Speaker_A | Yep , alright ."
"[05:39] Speaker_D | Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Okay ."
[05:50] Speaker_C | Alright .
[05:55] Speaker_A | Wood is popular . Aha .
[05:57] Speaker_D | We don't want wood .
"[05:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , among the old people , yeah ."
"[06:00] Speaker_D | Old people . So , that's it for me ."
"[06:03] Speaker_A | Alright . Nice , uh well show us ."
"[06:17] Speaker_C | Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design ."
"[06:24] Speaker_C | Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way ."
"[06:45] Speaker_D | Yeah , we should change that ."
[07:01] Speaker_D | No no no .
[07:04] Speaker_C | Yeah . Also Yeah .
"[07:07] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb ."
[07:08] Speaker_A | Yeah ?
"[07:24] Speaker_C | Then I've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that ."
"[07:45] Speaker_C | They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours ."
[07:53] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[08:08] Speaker_C | Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And"
[08:18] Speaker_D | Mm . Yeah .
[08:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[08:24] Speaker_C | also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh"
"[08:39] Speaker_C | discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that ."
[08:52] Speaker_B | Soccer fronts . Mm .
[08:55] Speaker_C | Mm .
[08:58] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[08:59] Speaker_C | Well I also have um
[08:59] Speaker_A | All the results ?
"[09:03] Speaker_C | several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean ."
[09:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:10] Speaker_C | Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .
[09:16] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[09:17] Speaker_C | It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . You also uh see uh this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh That's true ."
[09:21] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm . Nai . Uh no .
[09:22] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[09:40] Speaker_A | It's t terrible . Alright .
[09:46] Speaker_A | Hmm ?
"[09:50] Speaker_A | Yeah , alright ."
"[09:52] Speaker_D | Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah ."
"[09:57] Speaker_D | Yeah , it still has a strong look ."
[09:59] Speaker_A | Yeah . And it's round .
[10:01] Speaker_D | But then you are losing your fruity colours .
[10:04] Speaker_A | Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .
[10:09] Speaker_D | That's true .
"[10:15] Speaker_A | No , it isn't ."
[10:19] Speaker_A | Okay .
[10:27] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[10:32] Speaker_D | But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel ."
"[10:41] Speaker_A | So , if you ti"
[10:46] Speaker_A | You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
[10:52] Speaker_D | Right .
[10:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[10:53] Speaker_B | Oh .
[10:54] Speaker_D | I agree .
"[10:55] Speaker_C | And I Then I have some more findings . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun ."
"[11:23] Speaker_C | That's a bit uh much . And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you"
[11:41] Speaker_A | What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
[12:01] Speaker_A | Double curved ?
"[12:12] Speaker_C | Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive ."
[12:31] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[12:46] Speaker_B | The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .
[12:50] Speaker_B | Because people like that .
[12:52] Speaker_A | This soft material thing from uh Yeah .
"[12:52] Speaker_C | Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Uh soft enough . So that's uh basically what I want to talk about ."
[12:54] Speaker_D | Yeah . Right .
[12:54] Speaker_B | Yeah . Right . Yeah .
[12:57] Speaker_A | Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ?
[13:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
[13:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:24] Speaker_B | Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier .
"[13:32] Speaker_B | Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now ."
"[13:55] Speaker_B | Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the"
[13:56] Speaker_A | That's interesting .
"[14:14] Speaker_B | the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that ."
"[14:16] Speaker_C | Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah ."
[14:16] Speaker_D | Oh okay .
"[14:22] Speaker_A | Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function ."
[14:23] Speaker_D | Right .
[14:27] Speaker_B | No it doesn't does not do anything . But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap .
[14:27] Speaker_D | No .
[14:28] Speaker_A | Oh .
"[14:30] Speaker_D | But that that makes it cheap . It's it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap ."
[14:32] Speaker_A | Yes . I understand . But it has no functionality for our remote at all .
"[14:36] Speaker_B | No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks ."
"[14:37] Speaker_D | Yeah , right . Young people love them ."
[14:38] Speaker_C | But it it's n nice for young people . They like gadgets . Yeah .
"[14:41] Speaker_D | Yeah , ple"
[14:43] Speaker_D | Right .
[14:44] Speaker_C | If it's cheap . Yeah .
[14:44] Speaker_A | Hmm .
"[14:59] Speaker_B | um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that ."
[15:07] Speaker_A | So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?
"[15:18] Speaker_B | Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented ."
[15:42] Speaker_C | Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ?
[15:44] Speaker_A | Ah .
[15:50] Speaker_C | Mm . Alright .
[15:52] Speaker_D | How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?
"[16:01] Speaker_D | Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down ."
[16:04] Speaker_B | Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .
[16:04] Speaker_A | But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .
[16:08] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
[16:08] Speaker_B | Yes . Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .
[16:16] Speaker_A | Just uh There is already a blank . Yes ? So Yeah .
[16:20] Speaker_B | Mm so have I .
[16:25] Speaker_B | Nah .
[16:45] Speaker_C | I suggest a banana shape .
[16:48] Speaker_C | Because of the fruity uh fashion .
[16:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:50] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:51] Speaker_A | No m Next year that's out .
[17:00] Speaker_B | Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh
[17:04] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[17:06] Speaker_C | Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
[17:06] Speaker_B | correct .
[17:08] Speaker_B | Yeah just uh the numbers .
[17:13] Speaker_C | And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?
[17:19] Speaker_B | These these will be bigger in the the real design .
"[17:21] Speaker_C | Alright , yeah ."
"[17:24] Speaker_B | This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can"
[17:28] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[17:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[17:34] Speaker_B | Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click ."
[17:38] Speaker_A | Yes .
[17:41] Speaker_D | Right .
[17:44] Speaker_D | And you you need a you need a speaker .
[17:45] Speaker_A | And what's the menu button ?
[17:48] Speaker_B | Hmm ?
[17:53] Speaker_A | But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah .
"[17:58] Speaker_C | Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works ."
[18:02] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah .
[18:02] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:07] Speaker_C | Yeah ? Yeah ?
[18:11] Speaker_C | Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
"[18:17] Speaker_B | No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button ."
[18:17] Speaker_C | No .
[18:21] Speaker_A | Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .
[18:26] Speaker_D | Exit .
[18:27] Speaker_A | Exit .
"[18:27] Speaker_B | Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . You have uh redundancy ."
"[18:32] Speaker_A | Well , it's just a choice ."
"[18:39] Speaker_B | Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should ."
"[18:41] Speaker_C | Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ?"
[18:46] Speaker_B | Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here .
[18:52] Speaker_C | Uh-huh .
"[18:59] Speaker_D | Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something ."
"[18:59] Speaker_C | Microphone , yeah ."
"[19:01] Speaker_B | Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy ."
[19:14] Speaker_B | Well i
[19:24] Speaker_A | Huh ?
[19:24] Speaker_C | Alright .
[19:25] Speaker_D | Alright .
[19:26] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Okay .
[19:27] Speaker_B | This is my suggested design . Um Yes .
"[19:28] Speaker_A | Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make ."
[19:42] Speaker_A | I'd I agree .
[19:47] Speaker_C | Well yeah yeah yeah .
[19:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:52] Speaker_C | I can live with it .
[19:53] Speaker_A | Yes ?
[20:01] Speaker_B | Well these are
[20:03] Speaker_A | Too big .
[20:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[20:07] Speaker_C | They do they don't look fruity enough .
"[20:09] Speaker_B | No , well th"
[20:10] Speaker_A | They're all black .
[20:18] Speaker_B | Uh this is for children but th
[20:21] Speaker_A | No .
[20:23] Speaker_B | W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to .
[20:26] Speaker_D | Yeah right .
"[20:26] Speaker_C | Yeah , ok Yeah ."
[20:28] Speaker_A | Terrible .
[20:29] Speaker_D | This is just crazy .
[20:42] Speaker_D | Nah th It's too expensive . Yeah .
[20:43] Speaker_B | I don't know uh Too expensive ? Alright .
"[20:43] Speaker_A | Well , that's too expensive I think ."
[20:47] Speaker_B | Well Nah .
[20:48] Speaker_A | Alright . Yeah .
[20:50] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[20:52] Speaker_B | Ha , even more . N"
[20:52] Speaker_A | Huh .
[20:57] Speaker_D | But are we going for a strange uh form ?
[20:57] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
"[21:01] Speaker_A | No , not very strange ."
[21:01] Speaker_D | 'Cause people like that .
[21:02] Speaker_C | Not not too strange . No .
"[21:03] Speaker_D | Not too strange . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is ."
[21:04] Speaker_A | It still has t
[21:07] Speaker_A | Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand .
"[21:10] Speaker_D | I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that ."
[21:14] Speaker_A | Yeah ? Yeah ?
[21:18] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[21:19] Speaker_A | Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's It feels comfortable ."
"[21:31] Speaker_D | Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Yeah , different . Y yis"
"[21:34] Speaker_C | Exotic yeah . We have t Yeah , yeah . I will design it , we design it later . So we'll get to that later I guess ."
[21:36] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:39] Speaker_D | Alright . Great .
"[21:40] Speaker_A | Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it ."
[21:49] Speaker_A | I got this from our friends . So Uh yeah the conceptual design .
"[21:59] Speaker_A | These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story ."
"[22:25] Speaker_A | B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design ."
"[22:29] Speaker_B | Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ?"
[22:32] Speaker_C | But uh we should decide now .
"[22:32] Speaker_A | Yes , but we have to decide about these now . And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . Wow . Uh these things ."
[22:34] Speaker_B | Ah right .
"[22:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor"
[22:41] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[22:49] Speaker_C | Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . Yeah ."
[23:00] Speaker_B | Not everything .
[23:02] Speaker_C | Well we have to decide all these things ?
[23:03] Speaker_B | Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine .
[23:09] Speaker_C | W we can uh override them ?
[23:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[23:19] Speaker_A | What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened .
[23:37] Speaker_B | Just like um most cell phones are .
[23:42] Speaker_D | The front is the most important .
[23:52] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[23:53] Speaker_A | You know what ?
[24:00] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:03] Speaker_C | No but you have titanium of course . Uh you have the best of both worlds .
[24:03] Speaker_B | No but you you have this Yeah .
"[24:06] Speaker_D | Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay ."
"[24:13] Speaker_C | And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium ."
[24:16] Speaker_D | Yeah . Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
[24:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[24:19] Speaker_C | Yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a"
[24:23] Speaker_B | And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .
[24:23] Speaker_C | decision .
"[24:27] Speaker_D | Yeah , but it it's expensive ."
[24:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[24:31] Speaker_D | Bendable . Bendable .
"[24:36] Speaker_C | According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want ."
"[24:45] Speaker_B | Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it ."
[24:48] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:48] Speaker_C | Mm .
[24:50] Speaker_D | Paint spray .
[24:51] Speaker_C | Mm .
[24:52] Speaker_D | Yeah alright .
[24:54] Speaker_B | So Yeah .
"[24:55] Speaker_D | So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?"
[24:55] Speaker_A | Alright .
"[24:58] Speaker_C | Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off ."
[24:59] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[24:59] Speaker_A | Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . I Um solid feel and trendy look . So material , um hard plastic for the front ?"
"[25:05] Speaker_D | Yeah , great ."
[25:06] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:07] Speaker_C | Alright .
"[25:18] Speaker_C | Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back ."
[25:19] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[25:22] Speaker_C | For the non-removable uh part .
"[25:24] Speaker_D | But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . You know ?"
"[25:35] Speaker_C | The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't uh curves . No uh I nei . Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much ."
[25:47] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[25:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:50] Speaker_D | Alright .
[25:52] Speaker_D | Yeah . Alright .
"[25:53] Speaker_B | Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood ."
"[25:57] Speaker_C | And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh People like mm colours that don't match ."
[26:06] Speaker_C | Cop copper uh material .
[26:11] Speaker_C | Excuse me ?
[26:11] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:17] Speaker_B | No we don't use an electrical cable . Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine ."

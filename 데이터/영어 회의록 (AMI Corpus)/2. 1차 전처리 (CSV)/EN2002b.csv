[00:04] Speaker_C | No .
[00:04] Speaker_D | No .
[00:16] Speaker_B | Okay .
[00:24] Speaker_A | Okay . Who wants to take notes today ?
[00:29] Speaker_D | Oh .
[00:32] Speaker_D | Channel .
[00:35] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[00:38] Speaker_D | Mm 'kay . L I could take notes this time , I guess . I'll takes notes this time , I guess ."
[00:39] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[00:41] Speaker_A | What ? Th okay . Yeah .
"[00:44] Speaker_D | Actually , I suppose I'll use this ."
[00:45] Speaker_A | I'll make funny drawings .
[00:58] Speaker_A | Yep .
[01:01] Speaker_A | Thank you .
[01:33] Speaker_C | Okay .
[01:33] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[02:03] Speaker_C | I like the timeline .
"[02:17] Speaker_B | Okay , yeah . Basically that's fine , yeah ."
"[02:19] Speaker_C | Uh , b Let me see it . Oh , that's the same . Oh . Very good ."
[02:21] Speaker_D | Oh she has . She has her own . Yeah .
[02:24] Speaker_C | Um I'm not sure uh if we need the outline of the prototype . I mean what what are we gonna put into that ?
[02:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[02:47] Speaker_B | Yeah , we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen-shots or something ."
[02:50] Speaker_D | Alter .
[03:10] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[03:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[03:20] Speaker_D | Yeah . Anyways , so um so yeah , this just very general structure um , I guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and uh ."
[03:31] Speaker_D | Oh yeah ? Cool .
"[03:33] Speaker_D | I guess . Um so I don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this , I could do that before I mail it to you guys . Um otherwise yeah . Um did someone else wanna throw it togeth Actually I can probably still throw it together if you want , um put your parts into into this one ."
[03:42] Speaker_B | Uh it should be alright . Do we d
"[03:51] Speaker_D | I'm the perfectionist , right . Yeah ."
[04:12] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[04:13] Speaker_C | Yeah well , I mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that . I'm happy to do some as well . I have lots of time tonight ."
[04:19] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[04:26] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:42] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[04:46] Speaker_D | Or you just leave your computer on maybe . Logged in . Yeah .
[04:53] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[04:56] Speaker_D | Yeah . Actually I noticed that no one is . Anyways , alright ."
"[05:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , do what you wanna do with it first , and then I'll will look at Yeah , uh yeah . And I'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever . Yeah ."
[05:07] Speaker_D | Yep .
[05:09] Speaker_D | Okay .
[05:11] Speaker_D | Right .
[05:12] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[05:20] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[05:23] Speaker_C | Oh , there's more . Oh , I see . Oh , this is the one that okay ."
[05:30] Speaker_A | Probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff . I think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files .
[05:35] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[05:45] Speaker_C | That's what I thought as well , I mean do we are we are we actually gonna attempt that ?"
[05:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:47] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[05:48] Speaker_A | That's no , I don't th that's that's too big , yeah ."
"[05:50] Speaker_C | I don't think so either , yeah . I think that's gonna be a b we don't even know how to approach that at the moment , I think ."
[05:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[05:55] Speaker_A | No .
[05:56] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[05:57] Speaker_B | It's a good thing to have , to say we cou what we could have done if we had more time . A good future work thing , isn't it ? Stick in the conclusion of the final report . Should if we had more time , this is what we would have done . Yeah ."
[06:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:03] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[06:05] Speaker_D | Yeah . Unless we d unless we discover some sorta time-warp thing , it's not gonna happen . Yeah ."
"[06:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah , that's right . Um um so maybe I mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading , but put it under changes since the initial specification . And say , you know , we didn't we decided the the r time is too short , whatever ."
"[06:12] Speaker_A | Yeah , but that's definitely one thing we could just remove ."
"[06:20] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah , sure . Yep ."
[06:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:25] Speaker_B | We don't think there's enough time .
[06:28] Speaker_B | Or we felt there were more important things to do with our time than
[06:31] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[06:41] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[06:49] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:52] Speaker_C | M m meet these milestones at Yeah .
"[06:55] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's a good idea . You have should have a section probably ."
[06:57] Speaker_A | I mean we haven't really yeah .
[06:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[06:59] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:01] Speaker_D | Exactly . Yeah .
[07:03] Speaker_B | The best file on target or something .
"[07:06] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah . Yeah , put it put it good ."
[07:31] Speaker_C | And you can say yeah . We uh say we are still aiming for the development to be complete on the or something . M .
[07:34] Speaker_B | Speaker characterisation .
[07:37] Speaker_B | Jesus .
[07:40] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[07:42] Speaker_D | Oh really ? Oh Jeez . H Um is are one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of expectations ?
[07:53] Speaker_D | Yeah . Okay . Alright . Like should we put i a hint that something like that might happen into the document ?
[07:58] Speaker_B | Or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer .
"[08:01] Speaker_C | Yeah , that's right . I I really wanna do it . I mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult . If at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta-data file . That's gonna be no work at all . So it's definitely gonna be something there ."
"[08:01] Speaker_D | Okay . Alright . Okay . Yeah , I know . Yeah ."
"[08:03] Speaker_B | Probably we won't disappear it , yeah ."
[08:11] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah . Yep .
"[08:11] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . Yeah , true . Yeah ."
"[08:15] Speaker_B | Yeah , we won't make it disappear , but we might thin it down a bit ."
"[08:15] Speaker_D | Okay , sounds good ."
[08:15] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[08:18] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[08:19] Speaker_B | Um but we might not , you know , but we might have time . Depends how how how how things m"
"[08:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , it might turn out easier than thought ."
[08:33] Speaker_D | Okay . Tuned I guess or yeah . Yeah .
[08:42] Speaker_D | Cool .
[08:46] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[08:46] Speaker_C | Yeah , sounds good ."
[08:50] Speaker_C | What else ?
[08:50] Speaker_D | Okay .
[08:54] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[08:56] Speaker_A | I don't know . Shall we change the deadlines ?
"[08:57] Speaker_C | We should probably d sorry , we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well . That's what he hinted that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on ."
[09:08] Speaker_D | Right . Yeah . Well I could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well . That's essentially the same as it was . Maybe more detailed specifically .
"[09:12] Speaker_B | Yeah , pretty much ."
"[09:17] Speaker_C | Well you could put , you know yeah , I don't know ."
[09:25] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[09:27] Speaker_A | Yeah . Should we , I don't know , do you think , Mike , about our things that we had together ? Should we I mean now , yeah . I mean we have it now like inverted and you have the other But what about the m"
"[09:34] Speaker_D | Split those apart ? Yeah . I think so , yeah , like , yeah , inverted file . Yeah , exactly ."
"[09:47] Speaker_A | Yeah , we just keep it together on the the pap there right now and just see what what ?"
"[09:55] Speaker_A | No , not the disfluencies . No , haven't ."
"[10:01] Speaker_D | I know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow . We could just make it up . Like I'll claim one , you'll claim the other for the search things , and then we could leave that one as a a joint one ."
[10:12] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:12] Speaker_D | And that'd be good ? 'Kay .
[10:14] Speaker_C | Have you managed any further on the search thing ?
[10:27] Speaker_C | Alright .
[10:29] Speaker_C | That's nice .
[10:36] Speaker_C | Yeah yeah yeah .
[10:39] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[10:46] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[10:58] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah yeah . Certainly .
[11:06] Speaker_A | Yeah . Yeah . We'll see .
[11:08] Speaker_B | How about the underlying data for it ? For the d inverted file . How's that coming along ?
[11:12] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[11:13] Speaker_D | Oh .
[11:19] Speaker_D | Oh yeah .
[11:19] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[11:21] Speaker_B | Coming along .
"[11:40] Speaker_B | Easy , yeah . Just yeah , well it just um when he pulls up the segments um part of that , one of the f one of the attributes you do get attributes . get attributes , it returns a list of attributes . Search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got . And then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard-code and say , look , get me the time stamps . So you just say um get attribute and put I think it's I think the method's called get attribute and just it's called start time and end time . And that will tell you the start times and end times . I think it returns it double ."
[11:45] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[11:51] Speaker_A | Okay .
[11:58] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:09] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:14] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:16] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[12:24] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's on the um the n the the NOM right elements . The the the uh the object is a NOM right element , I think ."
"[12:24] Speaker_A | Tuple or something , yeah ."
[12:32] Speaker_A | Okay .
[12:34] Speaker_A | Mm .
[12:36] Speaker_B | That should uh tell you what it is .
[12:37] Speaker_A | Yeah . I'll take a look at that .
"[13:02] Speaker_C | Not since you looked at it last , no . But I will tonight , that's the point ."
"[13:31] Speaker_D | shouldn't be an issue . Actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results , um like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as what was the other ? Summaries . Um do we want separate result panes uh for each of those ? Or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of result they are ? So that when they , you know , click on that , it's gonna go to the relevant thing . Like just if they check all three say topics , summaries , blah blah blah , have three different windows come up ?"
"[13:57] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , yeah , yeah ."
[14:01] Speaker_D | Or three like sub sub-panes sort of .
"[14:02] Speaker_C | Well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up ? Or is that a r a second results pane ? Or is there , you know does the window get larger ? What's there kind of what are you thinking ?"
[14:19] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:24] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:28] Speaker_C | Yeah . Yeah .
[14:40] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[14:42] Speaker_B | What , have th th uh you confuse me . Do you have um three separate windows for the three separate different types of results ?"
"[14:50] Speaker_B | Okay , not not three different okay , okay , cool . Yeah . Okay . Right , yep ."
[14:57] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:01] Speaker_B | Yeah . Or tabs or something .
"[15:03] Speaker_C | Yeah , I quite like the idea of a tab in that case ."
"[15:07] Speaker_A | All of them , no ."
"[15:08] Speaker_C | But you wouldn't want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result , would you ?"
"[15:13] Speaker_D | Well it's no , but the thing is if you're looking if you could check them both um you wanna see all the results ."
"[15:16] Speaker_C | Actually mm , yeah . Especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting ."
"[15:18] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah , it's three panes ."
"[15:22] Speaker_C | Maybe yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah , it's true ."
"[15:30] Speaker_C | Yeah . I mean we could we could order them by meeting , for example ."
"[15:34] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah , I guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have this reorder by columns and all that . But that's a hassle too . It's a lot of work ."
"[15:38] Speaker_C | How to order it . Yeah well , I mean uh if , you know , that's uh you even a second step , the first question is do we want to order them . How do we wanna order them in the first place ."
"[15:46] Speaker_D | Yeah . I think , yeah , probably by meeting makes most sense . I mean essentially they're tem you know , in time order . So yeah , that kinda makes most sense ."
[15:50] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[15:57] Speaker_C | Yeah , maybe we should do that ."
"[15:59] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . Should be an easy no , I don't know actually . Should be fairly easy , I guess ."
"[16:21] Speaker_C | Yeah , m why don't you just um"
[16:25] Speaker_C | colour-code those .
[16:27] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[16:27] Speaker_C | The results to three different colours .
[17:06] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[17:07] Speaker_D | Right .
[17:09] Speaker_D | Yeah . Yeah . It's just silly .
[17:18] Speaker_C | Oh right .
"[17:21] Speaker_C | Ah . Well , have a look ."
"[17:29] Speaker_C | Oh , mm-hmm ."
"[17:33] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , I can imagine ."
"[17:38] Speaker_C | Oh , oh , I see , yeah ."
[17:43] Speaker_C | You you have to use actions .
"[17:49] Speaker_C | Um yeah , I mean um at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window , doesn't it ?"
[17:55] Speaker_D | Right . I think so .
[18:10] Speaker_C | What do you mean it should work with anything ?
[18:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[18:24] Speaker_D | Okay .
[18:34] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:42] Speaker_C | Um no , but I know what it's called . And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well . As I said , you know , if you if you left-click on something for example , it highlights automatically . So maybe it comes with something clever as well ."
[18:48] Speaker_D | Okay . Okay . Alright .
[18:52] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[18:54] Speaker_D | Okay , maybe I should maybe I should use that as well in my Yeah , okay ."
[18:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[18:59] Speaker_B | It's called a NITE text pane or something , isn't it ? Is it ?"
"[19:06] Speaker_C | I don't know , text text yeah , something like that . Might yep . NOM text there is alright . Yeah , why what's NOM anyway ? NITE Oh ."
"[19:06] Speaker_B | Text area or something something like that , yeah ."
[19:10] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[19:11] Speaker_B | NOM text , yeah . Mostly things are called NOM . Yeah ."
"[19:16] Speaker_D | Okay , that makes sense ."
[19:19] Speaker_A | What do you say ?
[19:34] Speaker_D | Mm .
"[19:41] Speaker_B | The removing the disfluencies , have you done anything with that yet ? Anybody . 'Cause um I was wondering how we're gonna write it back to H_T_M_L_ I mean X_M_L_ , if we take if we did the processing ."
"[19:46] Speaker_A | No , we haven't ."
"[19:59] Speaker_D | It's I thought we were just going to have that as words . Like not ev not as X_M_L_ , just sort of as a Was that What was that um What transcripts recent oh no , transcript no , 'cause then we need all the other data if we wanna keep it a transcript , right ."
[20:05] Speaker_B | There's a blop of text .
[20:08] Speaker_B | Text file .
[20:14] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[20:16] Speaker_A | Yeah , that's true ."
"[20:16] Speaker_D | Yeah , that's true , yeah . Good point ."
[20:21] Speaker_C | Why do you why do we want it in X_M_L_ there ? I mean I thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively write the X_M_L_ that we've got .
[20:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:33] Speaker_B | Oh , select what we want , just take bits of the X_M_L_ and take only it takes certain segments . Yeah ."
[20:35] Speaker_C | Yeah t
[20:36] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[20:37] Speaker_C | Yeah , only only print out certain um certain segments , the segments that we want just selectively . At the moment it prints out all of them . We'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements . Not not store it at all whatsoever ."
"[20:43] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Certain segments . Okay , yeah , yeah . Alright ."
[20:44] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:47] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[20:52] Speaker_D | Oh yeah ? Okay , then that's then that's not yeah . Yeah , I know . That's sorta what we were thinking before . Actually , but this makes more sense ."
[20:56] Speaker_A | Okay .
[20:57] Speaker_C | Oh right .
"[20:57] Speaker_B | Then written to a written to a file . I kinda doubt just that it would ever be done . But that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh , 'cause you need to do things on word level . So yeah , that's fine ."
[21:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[21:06] Speaker_D | Yeah , if we're gonna do the X_M_L_ , then fine , that's that probably makes it easier ."
[21:08] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:08] Speaker_A | I mean , we're not really uh well , I mean"
[21:12] Speaker_A | we're not gonna do much more than just look at the
"[21:17] Speaker_A | the rem like the text problem with disfluencies , 'cause we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it ."
[21:25] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[21:26] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[21:26] Speaker_A | Since we're not doing the audio thing .
[21:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:29] Speaker_A | So I guess just to displaying it is a alright . But , well anyway , yeah ."
[21:30] Speaker_C | So what ?
[21:33] Speaker_B | It's fine . Yeah .
"[21:33] Speaker_D | As text , you mean ?"
"[21:34] Speaker_C | Yeah , yeah , you don't really need to do much more with it . Yeah , that's right ."
[21:36] Speaker_A | No .
"[21:37] Speaker_D | The thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know , create a text file , take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah ."
[21:48] Speaker_A | Well that is true .
[21:49] Speaker_D | Unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file . Yeah . That's true too .
"[21:52] Speaker_B | Yeah . Then it will look ugly probably , 'cause it will look just black and white . Unless you want as dark colouring ."
[21:56] Speaker_A | It's probably best and do as you said . Like just like yeah . No . No .
"[22:01] Speaker_B | No no , I don't think that's I think it's true ."
[22:03] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:14] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:15] Speaker_B | So then just goes through it and says if this word equals that then print .
[22:15] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:19] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[22:19] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[22:24] Speaker_C | You could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription , have them run parallel ."
[22:24] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[22:41] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
"[22:44] Speaker_B | Yeah , you probably could actually . This is probably and that's probably not that much more difficult . You just fatten the code out a bit . I It would be the same thing ."
[22:47] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[22:49] Speaker_C | Yeah . But then
"[22:52] Speaker_C | you know , the the b the good way of doing it um not together is that you if someone doesn't wanna look at the the , you know , the chop file , then you don't ever have to produce it ."
"[23:02] Speaker_B | And they can't yeah , exactly ."
[23:17] Speaker_D | Right .
"[23:20] Speaker_B | Shouldn't , no . It's just uh they'd just be if statements when they fast if statements , aren't they . This is loads of if statements ."
[23:20] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[23:22] Speaker_C | Yeah , i um ."
"[23:22] Speaker_D | Yeah . Or I don't know . I was just thinking as well , I mean we could probably even use like X_S_L_T_ to kinda just transform it and , you know , flip it into uh yeah , just uh transforms um like um style sheet , the um X_M_L_ style sheet . And then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built into Java , I mean to process X_M_L_ into like in just creates whatever file it's gonna be in . Uh it's been a f couple of years since I've looked into anything like this . But uh that might even be an easier way . And then that way we could even pre-process that before hand . I don't know , do well we don't wanna have to do that , right ? Although on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun ."
[23:36] Speaker_C | Oh right .
"[23:59] Speaker_B | I wouldn't wanna have to put it take to put it back into X_M_L_ with Java . Even trying to read it in X_M_L_ with Java was complicated enough . I gave up doing that completely and just defaulted back to n uh NITE stuff , 'cause it was much much much easier ."
[24:05] Speaker_D | Oh right ? Oh really ? Okay . Yeah .
[24:10] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[24:11] Speaker_C | Yeah .
"[24:12] Speaker_B | So if we can do it with NITE stuff , do it with NITE stuff , I think . Otherwise , you're gonna be s Java , trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous ."
[24:18] Speaker_D | Okay . Yeah .
[24:21] Speaker_B | Don't believe it . You have to d start defining object models like the NITE thing and getting all bizarre w weird things . It was mad .
"[24:25] Speaker_D | Yeah , okay . Are you serious ?"
[24:28] Speaker_D | It's insane .
"[24:31] Speaker_D | Actually I was thinking I might try and talk to who is it , Jonathan and Jean ? Like just to see h what they what system they used to develop this stuff . 'Cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system , you know , at a higher level rather than kinda , you know , playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that . It'd be nice to just sorta see what they're doing . So I might uh try and contact them , see if there's , I don't know ,"
[24:35] Speaker_C | Hmm . Mm .
"[24:59] Speaker_D | any other hints they could give us . Just to get things , I don't know , moving at a higher level I guess ."
[25:06] Speaker_D | It seems it'd be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would .
"[25:18] Speaker_C | That's what programming is all about , I'm afraid ."
[25:18] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:18] Speaker_D | A channel .
[25:31] Speaker_C | Yeah . Maybe . That's the higher people .
"[25:38] Speaker_C | Well , I mean"
"[25:40] Speaker_C | yeah , why don't you put both of both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something , if you wanna do it . I I personally don't wanna mess with uh writing files or anything the moment . I wanna do it superficially ."
[25:47] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[25:49] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[25:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[25:58] Speaker_D | Like the thing that I was thinking there is well is that once it's done for a f you know , one meeting , it's done and it's there . It's file . Text file or X_M_L_ or whatever it is . But yeah , just , I don't know , just it doesn't make any difference really either way to me . It's like hmm if it's fast enough on the fly , then sure . Um that's about the only issue I have with on the fly , whether it's fast enough ."
[26:03] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[26:18] Speaker_C | Yeah .

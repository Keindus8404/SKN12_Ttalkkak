[00:32] Speaker_A | together .
[00:35] Speaker_A | For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the
[00:41] Speaker_A | conceptual design meeting .
[00:46] Speaker_A | Okay and the agenda will be
[00:52] Speaker_A | the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh
[01:04] Speaker_A | Agnes and from Mister Ed .
[01:08] Speaker_A | And finally in this meeting we have to decide
[01:13] Speaker_A | and we are to take a decision on the remote control
[01:18] Speaker_A | concept and uh the functional design
"[01:23] Speaker_A | So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh"
"[01:29] Speaker_A | little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the"
"[01:37] Speaker_A | the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept ."
"[01:44] Speaker_C | Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . I'm number two ."
[01:51] Speaker_A | You're number two .
[02:06] Speaker_C | So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah .
[02:10] Speaker_A | The next one .
"[02:11] Speaker_C | Right here , is that little that one , yes please . Thank you . I'll take the mouse ."
"[02:23] Speaker_C | we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research ."
[02:54] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[05:43] Speaker_C | And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?"
"[06:59] Speaker_C | I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . Let's go back up here ."
[07:01] Speaker_B | Thank you . Yeah .
"[07:02] Speaker_A | Yes , uh question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ?"
[07:10] Speaker_C | I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .
[07:21] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[07:21] Speaker_C | Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .
"[07:32] Speaker_C | I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting ."
"[07:34] Speaker_A | Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good ."
[07:39] Speaker_C | Sounds good .
[07:41] Speaker_B | Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?
"[07:43] Speaker_C | Because um it gets brittle ,"
[07:48] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[07:53] Speaker_C | We want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .
"[08:26] Speaker_A | So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes ."
"[08:28] Speaker_D | Actually , I'm ready to sell it . I'm ready to sell it ."
"[08:35] Speaker_D | No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there ."
"[08:41] Speaker_B | Yeah , exactly , yeah ."
[08:46] Speaker_D | That's actually very innovative idea .
"[08:55] Speaker_D | Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood ."
[09:01] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[09:02] Speaker_B | The stain .
[09:08] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[09:12] Speaker_A | Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?"
[09:31] Speaker_B | Y yeah .
"[10:10] Speaker_D | They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew 'em up ."
"[10:12] Speaker_C | Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah ."
[10:15] Speaker_D | And chew 'em up .
"[10:16] Speaker_A | Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes ."
[10:19] Speaker_B | Sure .
"[10:22] Speaker_C | Oh , I'm sorry ."
[10:38] Speaker_A | You are in participant three .
"[10:39] Speaker_B | One point three , yeah ."
"[10:42] Speaker_B | Uh , yeah ."
[10:43] Speaker_A | This one ?
"[10:44] Speaker_B | I think so , yeah ."
"[10:46] Speaker_B | Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control ."
[11:55] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[12:12] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[12:30] Speaker_B | You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops ,"
"[12:46] Speaker_B | channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish"
[13:02] Speaker_B | number pad .
[13:18] Speaker_C | Mm .
[13:20] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[13:25] Speaker_B | Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip"
"[13:36] Speaker_B | I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different ."
[13:56] Speaker_C | A hinge .
[13:58] Speaker_C | Be like a copper hinge or you know .
"[13:59] Speaker_B | Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences ."
[14:05] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:08] Speaker_C | Mm .
"[14:23] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ."
[14:26] Speaker_D | Hmm .
"[14:27] Speaker_B | So , that's pretty much all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and"
[14:49] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[14:52] Speaker_C | Mm .
[14:53] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[14:55] Speaker_B | So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines ."
"[15:04] Speaker_A | So what's your , uh , the comments or uh"
[15:09] Speaker_D | Simple design .
[15:11] Speaker_D | It's what consumers want .
"[15:14] Speaker_D | It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . Problem is obviously gonna be cost ."
[15:21] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[15:23] Speaker_D | Okay , I also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want ."
[15:28] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[15:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[15:32] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[15:37] Speaker_D | different type of remote .
[15:44] Speaker_D | There should only be one in here . trend watch .
[15:54] Speaker_D | It's being modified . They're stealing our product .
"[16:20] Speaker_C | No , f go to findings ."
"[16:21] Speaker_B | No , no ."
"[16:22] Speaker_D | No no , no no ."
"[16:59] Speaker_D | And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . The first one , I see that they put in a display ."
[17:35] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[17:46] Speaker_C | Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in ."
[17:49] Speaker_B | Right .
"[17:52] Speaker_D | Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , yeah . Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use ,"
[17:53] Speaker_B | Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah .
[18:01] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[18:07] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[18:13] Speaker_D | uh with a display ,"
"[18:20] Speaker_C | You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand ."
[18:42] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[18:56] Speaker_B | But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .
[19:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:10] Speaker_A | I hope so .
[19:15] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:18] Speaker_B | Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick ."
"[19:23] Speaker_D | Although , what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions ."
[19:28] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
[19:29] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[19:30] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[19:32] Speaker_C | Right , mm ."
"[19:33] Speaker_B | And that took off , yeah , yeah ."
"[19:37] Speaker_D | So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market ."
[19:43] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[19:46] Speaker_C | We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws ."
"[19:59] Speaker_C | You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device ."
[20:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[20:22] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[20:23] Speaker_A | Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more ."
[20:28] Speaker_C | Cost of living is low .
"[20:44] Speaker_A | Yeah , yeah , so"
[20:46] Speaker_D | Where w Where it would be manufactured is is
[20:46] Speaker_B | Mm yeah .
[20:46] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[20:50] Speaker_D | another step . We're here to design ,"
[20:51] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[20:55] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[20:59] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[21:16] Speaker_A | So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking ."
"[21:30] Speaker_A | And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so"
[21:33] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[21:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[21:49] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[21:50] Speaker_B | So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display"
[21:56] Speaker_C | Hmm .
"[21:58] Speaker_B | is a way to go . I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's"
[22:02] Speaker_C | Hmm .
[22:04] Speaker_C | Mm-hmm .
"[22:11] Speaker_B | probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but"
"[22:22] Speaker_B | that's just sort of speculation , I mean ."
[22:37] Speaker_D | No . No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .
[22:39] Speaker_C | Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?
[22:43] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[22:46] Speaker_D | Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . I will market it . Once we get a price on it then we can market it ."
[22:51] Speaker_A | Yes .
"[23:04] Speaker_C | we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case ."
[23:19] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:30] Speaker_A | I don't think so .
[23:32] Speaker_A | Yes .
[23:33] Speaker_A | Yes .
[23:34] Speaker_A | Don't looks nice uh .
"[23:37] Speaker_A | Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . Okay . So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . Okay ?"
[23:49] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[23:58] Speaker_B | Okay .
[24:02] Speaker_B | Sure .
[24:10] Speaker_C | So um are we done with this meeting ?
"[24:14] Speaker_A | Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management . Okay ?"
"[24:28] Speaker_A | Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay ."
[24:33] Speaker_C | And a marketing strategy .
[24:37] Speaker_A | Yes .
[24:41] Speaker_A | how mu how much how much you can sell extra .
"[24:44] Speaker_A | Of course you'll make money too , so it"
"[24:47] Speaker_A | it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission ."
"[24:52] Speaker_A | Okay , so , any questions ?"
[24:56] Speaker_B | No .
"[24:57] Speaker_A | So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there ."
[25:05] Speaker_B | Okay . Mm-hmm .
"[25:06] Speaker_A | It's okay ? So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . Okay ? Thank you ."
[25:14] Speaker_B | Okay .

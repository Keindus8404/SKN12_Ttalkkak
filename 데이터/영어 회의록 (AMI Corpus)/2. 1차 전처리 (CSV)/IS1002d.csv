[00:23] Speaker_D | Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe .
"[00:25] Speaker_A | Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ?"
[00:31] Speaker_B | Yep .
"[00:33] Speaker_A | And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool ."
[01:10] Speaker_B | Alright .
[01:19] Speaker_C | Thi third third third .
"[01:20] Speaker_B | Three , three ."
[01:22] Speaker_C | The end product thingy .
[01:26] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[01:28] Speaker_A | Who wants it ?
[01:31] Speaker_B | Pedro can have it .
[01:36] Speaker_B | I like I'll help talk .
"[01:43] Speaker_C | Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . Um"
[01:53] Speaker_B | Unit price .
"[02:00] Speaker_C | we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll ."
"[02:25] Speaker_A | Zapping your favourite channels , eh ?"
[02:27] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[02:28] Speaker_B | Scrolling through your favourites list .
[02:29] Speaker_A | Oh okay okay .
[02:30] Speaker_C | Zapping you know zapping .
"[02:31] Speaker_A | Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites ."
[02:32] Speaker_C | Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . And um yeah that was the result .
[02:38] Speaker_A | Ah 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well .
[02:43] Speaker_B | It's very prominent .
"[02:48] Speaker_B | So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ?"
[03:05] Speaker_A | Okay .
[03:21] Speaker_B | This is the teletext .
[03:21] Speaker_C | Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah .
"[03:26] Speaker_A | Ah , okay I see ."
[03:43] Speaker_A | It's pretty cool .
[03:52] Speaker_A | Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?
[03:57] Speaker_B | Yeah that might be a possible
"[04:00] Speaker_B | a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it yeah ."
[04:03] Speaker_C | Not helping .
[04:06] Speaker_A | Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it .
"[04:09] Speaker_B | Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it ."
[04:14] Speaker_A | Mm . Feels good . I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .
[04:19] Speaker_B | Yeah of course . Well this is clay .
[04:29] Speaker_A | Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense .
[04:33] Speaker_A | It's cool . I'm impressed .
[04:35] Speaker_C | Don't have no one to handle that .
"[04:37] Speaker_D | Mm that's oh that's oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this ."
[04:37] Speaker_A | And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ?
[04:50] Speaker_D | Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job .
[04:54] Speaker_B | Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .
[04:56] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[04:57] Speaker_C | So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .
[05:03] Speaker_B | Beep beep beep .
[05:06] Speaker_C | The locator function .
[05:07] Speaker_D | I'm ha
[05:08] Speaker_D | It's great . That's great . It's a great feature .
[05:11] Speaker_B | Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up . Beep beep beep okay . Um no no no tha that's alri
[05:18] Speaker_A | I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on .
[05:38] Speaker_A | Ah okay okay .
[05:52] Speaker_A | Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ?
"[06:01] Speaker_A | But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides ."
[06:03] Speaker_B | Mm .
[06:06] Speaker_B | Right .
[06:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[06:12] Speaker_D | Uh , I can see that ."
"[06:13] Speaker_A | But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ?"
[06:16] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[06:19] Speaker_D | Yep I like . Good job .
[06:22] Speaker_A | So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ?
[06:24] Speaker_B | Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time .
[06:27] Speaker_A | Okay .
[06:28] Speaker_B | So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .
[06:31] Speaker_A | The hmm .
[06:36] Speaker_B | Careful .
[06:44] Speaker_A | I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .
[06:46] Speaker_D | My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .
[06:51] Speaker_A | Mm .
[06:52] Speaker_D | You know some blend of silvers and blacks .
[07:03] Speaker_A | 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ?
[07:07] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[07:07] Speaker_C | Ja .
[07:12] Speaker_A | Now now .
[07:17] Speaker_D | So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board .
[07:22] Speaker_A | Have you ? Okay .
[07:23] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah .
[07:27] Speaker_A | Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?
"[07:30] Speaker_D | No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot ."
[07:33] Speaker_A | Oh I see I see .
[07:53] Speaker_D | Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?
[08:01] Speaker_D | So what we had is we had the method .
"[08:08] Speaker_D | That's not how you spell method , is it ?"
[08:10] Speaker_B | No way .
[08:11] Speaker_D | No A_ .
[08:22] Speaker_D | And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .
"[08:34] Speaker_D | And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . We've got the features ,"
"[08:47] Speaker_D | we have the uh characteristics ,"
[08:55] Speaker_D | and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the
[09:07] Speaker_D | Help me .
"[09:10] Speaker_D | The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um"
[09:19] Speaker_C | It fell off .
[09:25] Speaker_B | Beep beep beep .
"[09:54] Speaker_D | One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w"
"[10:45] Speaker_A | Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?"
"[10:54] Speaker_D | That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense ."
[11:13] Speaker_A | Mm-hmm .
[11:15] Speaker_A | Mm 'kay .
[11:17] Speaker_D | But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction .
"[11:23] Speaker_D | But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only ."
"[11:37] Speaker_D | Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back ."
"[11:56] Speaker_A | And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that ."
[12:12] Speaker_A | Hmm .
[12:26] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
"[12:26] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s"
"[12:42] Speaker_A | Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works ."
[12:51] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[12:53] Speaker_D | Yep .
[12:54] Speaker_A | Mm there's a risk of that .
[12:58] Speaker_A | Okay so we can talk about finance now .
"[13:02] Speaker_A | So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ?"
"[13:11] Speaker_B | Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units ."
[13:17] Speaker_A | Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this .
[13:23] Speaker_C | Very co very colf colourful .
[13:23] Speaker_B | Oh .
[13:29] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[13:42] Speaker_B | Uh-huh .
[13:49] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[13:49] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[13:49] Speaker_C | beep beep beep .
"[14:03] Speaker_B | Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there ."
[14:11] Speaker_A | Okay .
[14:13] Speaker_A | Yep .
[14:18] Speaker_A | Okay .
"[14:20] Speaker_A | So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah ."
[14:25] Speaker_A | Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?
[14:30] Speaker_A | We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur
"[14:34] Speaker_B | It's single-curved , yeah ."
[14:36] Speaker_A | You think ? Okay I'm convinced .
"[14:45] Speaker_B | See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it ."
[14:54] Speaker_B | Okay .
[14:58] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[14:58] Speaker_B | Yeah we do .
[15:00] Speaker_B | Ah . What do you know .
"[15:11] Speaker_A | Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ?"
[15:18] Speaker_C | It's a scroll .
[15:19] Speaker_B | That's a scroll .
[15:24] Speaker_B | Uh no we just use it as a scroll .
[15:26] Speaker_D | Ooh .
[15:27] Speaker_A | Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros .
[15:31] Speaker_B | It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say .
[15:32] Speaker_C | Yes .
[15:34] Speaker_C | We're wicked . Awesome .
[15:37] Speaker_A | Okay so
[15:39] Speaker_B | S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate .
[15:42] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[15:42] Speaker_A | We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the
[15:59] Speaker_A | How's it going ?
[16:03] Speaker_B | What ?
[16:06] Speaker_B | I think we did pretty well .
[16:07] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:08] Speaker_A | I think we did pretty well too . That looks pretty spectacular .
"[16:11] Speaker_D | No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept ."
[16:28] Speaker_A | Any other chang uh thoughts ?
[16:36] Speaker_A | Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?
[16:43] Speaker_A | Is it the .
[16:44] Speaker_B | Sh I think there was plenty of room . We got a couple innovative i
[16:46] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[16:46] Speaker_A | I I think we we ended up being quite creative there .
"[16:49] Speaker_D | Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us ."
[16:50] Speaker_B | Couple innovative ideas .
[16:59] Speaker_A | Mm .
[17:02] Speaker_C | No .
[17:03] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[17:05] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[17:14] Speaker_C | Basically .
[17:17] Speaker_D | Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
[17:23] Speaker_D | But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it .
"[17:31] Speaker_A | 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing ."
[17:40] Speaker_C | It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
[17:40] Speaker_B | Yep .
[17:44] Speaker_A | I agree .
[17:47] Speaker_C | Teamwork .
[17:47] Speaker_D | Cohesive yeah . Yes synergistic yeah .
[17:49] Speaker_A | Synergy .
[17:58] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[18:00] Speaker_A | What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here ."
[18:05] Speaker_B | These cables suck .
[18:05] Speaker_A | Mm .
"[18:07] Speaker_A | Yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro"
[18:08] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[18:10] Speaker_B | Yep .
[18:12] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[18:12] Speaker_C | D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic .
"[18:17] Speaker_A | Mm-mm , lapel . Wha okay , oh , alright ."
[18:19] Speaker_B | Lapel .
"[18:24] Speaker_A | That's it's down , it's quite close ."
"[18:27] Speaker_A | Keep it , keep it calm ."
[18:58] Speaker_C | Use them like that .
[18:59] Speaker_B | Pedro's right .
[19:02] Speaker_B | Pedro's right .
[19:11] Speaker_B | Oh wel
[19:12] Speaker_D | New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta
[19:17] Speaker_A | Well let's do both then . Uh for the product ?
"[19:20] Speaker_B | Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle ,"
[19:25] Speaker_B | and the r uh remote call feature .
[19:26] Speaker_D | Oh .
[19:27] Speaker_A | Yeah we came up with quite a bit .
[19:29] Speaker_C | Bunch of new ideas .
[19:34] Speaker_C | Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .
[19:36] Speaker_A | Yeah less sore on the ears .
"[19:37] Speaker_D | Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but I don't think that's the"
[19:37] Speaker_C | Mm .
[19:59] Speaker_D | that's avoidable .
[20:00] Speaker_C | Coulda been worse .
[20:05] Speaker_C | Mm n no .
[20:06] Speaker_D | No .
"[20:06] Speaker_A | Nope . Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good ."
"[20:16] Speaker_A | And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says ."
[20:26] Speaker_C | Hooray . Free coke provided at the cafeteria .

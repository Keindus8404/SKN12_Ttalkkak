[01:00] Speaker_D | Yes .
[01:11] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[01:12] Speaker_A | Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design ."
[02:00] Speaker_B | Okay .
[02:00] Speaker_D | Okay .
"[02:01] Speaker_A | It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes ."
[02:12] Speaker_D | No .
"[02:20] Speaker_A | Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me ."
[02:43] Speaker_A | And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ?
[02:58] Speaker_D | Yes .
[03:02] Speaker_D | Think I'll go first .
[03:07] Speaker_A | Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .
[03:26] Speaker_D | 'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that .
[03:31] Speaker_D | Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects .
[03:49] Speaker_D | Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .
"[03:58] Speaker_D | Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um"
[04:24] Speaker_D | Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
[04:34] Speaker_D | And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .
[04:41] Speaker_B | Mm .
[04:42] Speaker_D | some things .
[04:45] Speaker_D | Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most
"[05:03] Speaker_D | most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance ."
[05:21] Speaker_D | Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
[05:31] Speaker_D | Then these are the This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .
[05:57] Speaker_D | Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .
[06:05] Speaker_D | They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
[06:15] Speaker_D | What I think this indicates for our um
[06:19] Speaker_D | design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would
[06:25] Speaker_D | um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .
"[06:30] Speaker_D | Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable ."
[06:40] Speaker_D | Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
[06:46] Speaker_D | The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ .
"[06:57] Speaker_D | Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice ."
"[07:20] Speaker_D | As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote ."
[07:33] Speaker_D | Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily .
"[07:51] Speaker_D | Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be"
"[07:59] Speaker_D | and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep ."
[08:16] Speaker_D | So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
[08:25] Speaker_D | Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um
[08:39] Speaker_D | mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .
[08:57] Speaker_A | Okay .
[08:58] Speaker_D | That would be all .
[08:59] Speaker_A | Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?
[09:04] Speaker_D | Any questions ?
[09:06] Speaker_A | About functional requirements ? Okay that's clear .
[09:06] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[09:07] Speaker_C | No .
[09:10] Speaker_D | 'Kay .
[09:27] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[09:34] Speaker_B | Okay .
[09:36] Speaker_B | Mm ?
[09:37] Speaker_D | Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . Oh yeah .
[09:38] Speaker_B | Oh .
[09:40] Speaker_B | Uh .
[09:41] Speaker_A | Yeah . There it is . Yeah .
[09:41] Speaker_B | Okay .
[10:45] Speaker_A | One remote .
[10:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[10:51] Speaker_B | Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control ."
"[12:05] Speaker_B | Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display ."
[12:22] Speaker_B | It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device .
[13:10] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[13:43] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[13:46] Speaker_B | Yeah . Uh yeah .
[13:51] Speaker_A | Okay . Anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
[13:56] Speaker_C | Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .
[14:01] Speaker_B | N I I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah .
[14:02] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:06] Speaker_A | Touchscreen .
[14:16] Speaker_B | Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh
[14:30] Speaker_B | a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for
[14:37] Speaker_B | uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . So it's possible .
[14:42] Speaker_A | Huh .
[14:43] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[14:46] Speaker_D | Well it would certainly make a fancy design .
[14:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[14:49] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[14:49] Speaker_C | But the It wouldn't be very robust . It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
[14:55] Speaker_D | That is true .
[14:55] Speaker_A | That's right . Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design .
[14:56] Speaker_B | Yeah that's true .
[14:56] Speaker_D | We would have to look into that .
[15:01] Speaker_B | Uh .
[15:01] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[15:01] Speaker_C | That's .
[15:04] Speaker_C | Okay .
"[15:23] Speaker_C | Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is ."
"[15:44] Speaker_C | So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ ."
"[15:59] Speaker_C | It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button ."
"[16:25] Speaker_C | Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high ."
"[16:44] Speaker_C | And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product ."
"[16:51] Speaker_C | So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself ."
[17:01] Speaker_C | That's it .
[17:02] Speaker_A | Okay . Thank you .
[17:10] Speaker_A | Okay .
[17:21] Speaker_A | Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .
"[17:38] Speaker_A | Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions ."
[17:48] Speaker_B | Okay .
[17:58] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[17:58] Speaker_A | So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control ."
[18:21] Speaker_A | Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well .
"[18:31] Speaker_A | Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers ."
[18:46] Speaker_A | Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our
"[19:02] Speaker_A | uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest"
[19:28] Speaker_A | let's have a discussion on the control functions .
[19:33] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[19:34] Speaker_D | So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
[19:48] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[19:49] Speaker_D | Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access"
[20:09] Speaker_D | within the next like twenty years is very slim .
[20:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[20:14] Speaker_D | In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .
[20:27] Speaker_D | I'm pretty much against it .
[20:29] Speaker_A | Against the no teletext ?
[20:29] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[20:35] Speaker_D | Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like"
[20:39] Speaker_D | pretty small .
"[20:43] Speaker_D | But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another"
[20:49] Speaker_A | Standard remote .
[20:52] Speaker_A | No I think we can
[20:52] Speaker_D | and not innovative
[20:55] Speaker_D | remote control .
"[20:55] Speaker_A | I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market ."
[21:13] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[21:16] Speaker_A | And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now ."
[21:30] Speaker_D | Yes but it's not the biggest part of the
[21:34] Speaker_D | market .
[21:35] Speaker_A | No .
"[21:35] Speaker_D | And besides that , they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care"
[21:40] Speaker_D | what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
"[21:48] Speaker_A | But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So let's try it ."
[22:06] Speaker_D | No .
[22:08] Speaker_D | I think that would be the case in the
[22:10] Speaker_D | sixteen to forty five age category .
[22:16] Speaker_D | because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .
[22:20] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[22:21] Speaker_D | People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but"
[22:27] Speaker_D | as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .
[22:31] Speaker_B | Mm .
[22:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[22:32] Speaker_C | I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?"
[22:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . It's a big success .
"[22:44] Speaker_C | Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just"
[22:45] Speaker_D | I haven't heard of it .
[22:45] Speaker_A | Very big success . Yeah .
[22:51] Speaker_D | Hmm .
[22:51] Speaker_A | Uh . I think so as well .
[22:52] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[23:00] Speaker_C | change our focus on the project , and I think"
[23:04] Speaker_C | we can uh we can sell this .
[23:07] Speaker_A | Uh I simply think um
"[23:13] Speaker_A | uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people ."
[23:43] Speaker_D | Yes .
[23:44] Speaker_B | Mm .
[23:47] Speaker_D | Yes .
[23:50] Speaker_D | But obviously the board tends to disagree .
"[23:53] Speaker_A | No we we haven't voted yet , so Uh I think teletext can be uh"
[24:01] Speaker_A | um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't
"[24:08] Speaker_A | higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem ."
[24:18] Speaker_B | But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . So it's Yeah .
[24:23] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[24:23] Speaker_D | Yeah , also ."
[24:26] Speaker_D | I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
[24:28] Speaker_B | Mm .
[24:28] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[24:30] Speaker_A | Is anybody um really against teletext ?
[24:34] Speaker_C | No .
"[24:34] Speaker_A | No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext ."
"[24:41] Speaker_A | I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles ."
[24:46] Speaker_A | Maybe we can
[24:49] Speaker_A | make that um
"[24:53] Speaker_A | another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles ."
[25:05] Speaker_B | Yeah yeah .
[25:11] Speaker_C | Uh that's a good idea .
[25:12] Speaker_B | Yeah . Yeah .
"[25:23] Speaker_A | Functionality should be few buttons , you said ."
[25:27] Speaker_D | Yes .
[25:28] Speaker_A | I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .
[25:28] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:32] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[25:35] Speaker_A | So to keep it simple .
[25:41] Speaker_D | Well might be .
[25:43] Speaker_B | If it's only for televi Yeah .
"[25:44] Speaker_D | But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,"
[25:46] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:48] Speaker_A | No .
[25:51] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[25:59] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[26:01] Speaker_D | I think if you if you only l
"[26:02] Speaker_B | So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it ."
[26:07] Speaker_D | Nah .
"[26:12] Speaker_D | Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times ."
[26:17] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:24] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[26:24] Speaker_A | No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ?"
[26:29] Speaker_A | Or a joystick like ?
[26:30] Speaker_B | Mm .
[26:35] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:37] Speaker_B | Mm-hmm .
[26:39] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[26:43] Speaker_D | That's true but um
[26:46] Speaker_D | I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like
[26:53] Speaker_D | the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .
[27:00] Speaker_D | And I dunno if many channels would
[27:03] Speaker_D | do have that . If many T_V_s have that .
[27:05] Speaker_C | Yeah . And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
[27:06] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:15] Speaker_A | That's right .
[27:15] Speaker_D | Mm-hmm .
[27:15] Speaker_B | Mm .
[27:31] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[27:33] Speaker_D | But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on"
"[27:41] Speaker_D | um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area ."
[27:55] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[27:56] Speaker_A | The number of buttons ? I think it's very important in the in the design .
[27:57] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[28:11] Speaker_D | That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .
[28:21] Speaker_A | To operate only the T_V_ yeah .
[28:21] Speaker_D | 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required .
[28:29] Speaker_D | There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .
[28:35] Speaker_A | No .
[28:35] Speaker_B | No .
[28:37] Speaker_A | So .
[28:37] Speaker_D | So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .
[28:42] Speaker_D | That would that would cost a a big marketing
[28:48] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[28:49] Speaker_A | That's right .
[28:50] Speaker_D | which was
[28:51] Speaker_D | one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .
[28:56] Speaker_A | Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .
[29:05] Speaker_A | Uh uh like other functions .
[29:09] Speaker_D | Maybe .
[29:09] Speaker_A | Instead of f of less buttons .
[29:19] Speaker_D | But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .
[29:22] Speaker_A | Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will
[29:27] Speaker_A | uh is allowed in the budget we have ?
"[29:32] Speaker_C | It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah ."
[29:34] Speaker_B | No .
[29:36] Speaker_A | No .
[29:39] Speaker_B | No .
[29:42] Speaker_A | That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement .
[29:45] Speaker_C | Yes .
[29:48] Speaker_B | Hmm .
[29:54] Speaker_A | Docking station .
[29:56] Speaker_C | So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?
[30:00] Speaker_A | I think so .
[30:01] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:01] Speaker_B | Mm .
[30:01] Speaker_D | Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into
[30:05] Speaker_D | what elderly people like to have in a
[30:08] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:08] Speaker_D | like to have extra in a new remote control .
[30:16] Speaker_A | You said they easily get lost as well .
[30:19] Speaker_D | Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
[30:22] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:24] Speaker_A | So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something ."
"[30:29] Speaker_D | Yeah that was what I suggested . You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing ."
[30:30] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[30:31] Speaker_C | Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound ."
[30:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[30:34] Speaker_B | Hm .
[30:38] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[30:42] Speaker_A | Yeah . So audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive . Uh another
[30:43] Speaker_D | So you know where it is .
[30:48] Speaker_B | No .
[30:54] Speaker_A | point is the L_C_D_ screen .
"[31:04] Speaker_C | Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause"
[31:10] Speaker_A | Yeah . It will be too much as well .
[31:11] Speaker_B | Mm .
"[31:12] Speaker_D | I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does ."
[31:31] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[31:35] Speaker_A | Based .
[31:35] Speaker_B | Okay . Yeah .
[31:38] Speaker_A | Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .
[31:43] Speaker_A | That's a good idea . So Some extra info . Feedback .
[31:46] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[31:48] Speaker_A | Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .
[31:48] Speaker_B | Yeah .
[31:51] Speaker_D | But I dunno if that would
[31:54] Speaker_A | As the small screen .
[31:54] Speaker_D | that would fit into the
[31:59] Speaker_D | costs .
[32:04] Speaker_A | Extra button info .
[32:32] Speaker_A | Yeah .
[32:36] Speaker_A | 'Kay .
[32:40] Speaker_A | And default materials .
"[32:44] Speaker_A | I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . So that doesn't really matter . So I think we nee"
[32:55] Speaker_D | No .
[32:55] Speaker_B | Mm .
[32:58] Speaker_D | I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than
[33:05] Speaker_D | youngsters .
"[33:08] Speaker_A | Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe ."
[33:28] Speaker_B | Mm . Yeah .
[33:29] Speaker_D | Yeah .
"[33:30] Speaker_A | Uh what do we want ? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can"
[33:40] Speaker_A | target the real elderly people .
"[33:44] Speaker_D | I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company ."
[33:53] Speaker_A | Yeah .
"[33:53] Speaker_D | And I think , I think there would be a good market for it ."
[33:58] Speaker_D | If we're able to really bring an innovative product .
[34:02] Speaker_A | Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .
[34:06] Speaker_A | Yeah . Sixty .
[34:07] Speaker_B | Mm .

[34:38] Speaker_D | adapt it to different cultures .
"[34:41] Speaker_A | Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah ."
[34:43] Speaker_D | Yeah .
[34:43] Speaker_C | Yeah .
[34:43] Speaker_B | Yeah .
"[34:45] Speaker_A | or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . It's better to put it on different markets with it all . Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things ."

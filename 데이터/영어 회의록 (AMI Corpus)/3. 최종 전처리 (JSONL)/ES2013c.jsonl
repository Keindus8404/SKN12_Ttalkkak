I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um"}

{"timestamp": "29:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , like up , down , left and right ."}

{"timestamp": "33:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "um that it's there ."}
{"timestamp": "33:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient ."}
{"timestamp": "33:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "33:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving ."}

{"timestamp": "33:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "33:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? It's like yeah , a good selling point ."}
{"timestamp": "33:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible ."}
{"timestamp": "34:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But it does depend how much"}

{"timestamp": "34:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "34:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "34:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know ."}
{"timestamp": "34:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "34:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly ."}

{"timestamp": "34:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision ."}

{"timestamp": "35:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "35:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um what about the case ?"}
{"timestamp": "35:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?"}
{"timestamp": "35:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "36:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I should I should r"}
{"timestamp": "36:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that ."}
{"timestamp": "36:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen ."}
{"timestamp": "37:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on ."}

{"timestamp": "37:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew .

{"timestamp": "38:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . Anything else we need to do ?"}

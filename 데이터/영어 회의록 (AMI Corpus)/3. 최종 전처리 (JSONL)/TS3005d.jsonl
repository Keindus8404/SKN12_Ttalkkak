{"timestamp": "28:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it ."}

{"timestamp": "28:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means ."}

{"timestamp": "29:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . So then it is one ."}
{"timestamp": "29:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , indeed , yeah . You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote ."}

So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved .

{"timestamp": "10:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Let's go crazy . And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range .

{"timestamp": "14:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So it will look like something like this ."}
{"timestamp": "14:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Double ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The double whopper , please ."}
{"timestamp": "14:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "14:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So rubber rubber keys , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ ."}

{"timestamp": "15:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well the rubber push-buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "15:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But anything is gonna have buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "15:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen .

{"timestamp": "15:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good ."}
{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Alright , that's me done ."}
{"timestamp": "15:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface ."}
{"timestamp": "15:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "16:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about ."}

{"timestamp": "16:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sorry ."}
{"timestamp": "16:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine ."}
{"timestamp": "17:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless ."}
{"timestamp": "17:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that"}

{"timestamp": "18:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um .

{"timestamp": "19:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "19:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me ."}
{"timestamp": "19:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "20:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "20:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "20:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad ."}

{"timestamp": "20:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , and we're not yeah . Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether"}

{"timestamp": "21:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button .

{"timestamp": "02:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some , moving kind of thing ."}

Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house ."}

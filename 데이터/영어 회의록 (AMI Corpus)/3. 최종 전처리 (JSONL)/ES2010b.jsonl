Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to"}
{"timestamp": "02:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for ."}
{"timestamp": "02:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes ."}
{"timestamp": "02:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "02:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , well let's go ahead and , back , previous . So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I don't mind going first ."}
{"timestamp": "03:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project ."}
{"timestamp": "03:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You know you could you could do it yourself actually ."}
{"timestamp": "03:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "03:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Did you send it ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Save it in the project documents . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Put it in Project Documents , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "03:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-mm-mm ."}
{"timestamp": "03:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "This one ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "03:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Great ."}
{"timestamp": "03:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera ."}
{"timestamp": "04:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off ,"}
{"timestamp": "04:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the channel going up and down ,"}
{"timestamp": "04:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "volume going up and down , and then mute ,"}
{"timestamp": "04:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus ."}
{"timestamp": "04:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example ."}
{"timestamp": "04:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "05:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "05:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating ."}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version ."}
{"timestamp": "05:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "05:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ready ."}
{"timestamp": "05:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place ."}
{"timestamp": "06:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "06:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ?"}
{"timestamp": "06:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm . Left ."}
{"timestamp": "06:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Now , that we've discussed Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "06:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I can go ."}
{"timestamp": "06:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , you should run it ."}
{"timestamp": "06:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Functional requirements . 'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "06:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements ."}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that meaning what ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "They like I guess use the buttons a lot . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "07:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I don't know . It's from my uh research ."}
{"timestamp": "07:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "07:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "My team wasn't very clear . That's okay ."}
{"timestamp": "07:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Only use ten percent of the buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "07:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really ."}
{"timestamp": "08:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , right ."}
{"timestamp": "08:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "08:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Good point . It's a necessary evil ."}
{"timestamp": "08:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It works . Ready for the next slide ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is ."}
{"timestamp": "08:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Lost ."}
{"timestamp": "08:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes , it is important for the remote control world ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Could be , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh possibly ."}
{"timestamp": "09:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I"}
{"timestamp": "09:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Channel , volume , power ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think that's a pretty good guess though ."}
{"timestamp": "09:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I would assume so . I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones ."}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Next slide ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "09:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it ."}
{"timestamp": "09:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "User-friendly ."}
{"timestamp": "10:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it ."}
{"timestamp": "10:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I guess so , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme ."}
{"timestamp": "11:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do ."}
{"timestamp": "11:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . We could definitely include that if we wanted to ."}
{"timestamp": "11:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "You know like go to the base . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?"}
{"timestamp": "11:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I'm just trying to move it ."}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "'Kay . I think it should be there , working design ."}
{"timestamp": "11:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Working design ."}
{"timestamp": "11:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "There we go ."}
{"timestamp": "11:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart ."}
{"timestamp": "11:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh my bad ."}
{"timestamp": "11:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh that's fine ."}
{"timestamp": "11:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Help me ."}
{"timestamp": "12:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What exactly is a smart chip ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions ."}
{"timestamp": "12:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap ."}
{"timestamp": "12:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ready ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um yep , nothing here ."}
{"timestamp": "12:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . Um a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system ."}
{"timestamp": "13:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again ,"}
{"timestamp": "13:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . Uh this is my fifty second design ."}
{"timestamp": "13:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to ."}
{"timestamp": "14:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "This is just like a rough schematic . So this is the internal workings ."}
{"timestamp": "14:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So this would be the front ? So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance ."}
{"timestamp": "14:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The l the light up kind of Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Like that we know the battery's working ."}
{"timestamp": "14:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? We can skip that whole thing . Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "14:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It'd probably be lighting up the key too , right ?"}

{"timestamp": "14:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles ."}

Wait , come back ."}
{"timestamp": "15:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote .

{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote ."}

{"timestamp": "17:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah it's the whole screen ."}
{"timestamp": "17:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?"}
{"timestamp": "17:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right . Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?"}

{"timestamp": "17:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes . It's part of the logo ."}

{"timestamp": "17:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright ."}

{"timestamp": "18:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or kids ?"}
{"timestamp": "18:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network ."}
{"timestamp": "18:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Most of them will intuitively pick it up though ."}
{"timestamp": "19:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about"}
{"timestamp": "19:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I think we need it all ."}
{"timestamp": "19:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?"}
{"timestamp": "19:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person ."}
{"timestamp": "19:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "19:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "High school educated ."}
{"timestamp": "19:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes ."}

{"timestamp": "20:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm , volume ."}
{"timestamp": "20:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones ."}
{"timestamp": "20:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right . And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . 'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "20:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hey , what else ?"}

{"timestamp": "20:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "20:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sure , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I need we we need a like homing device ."}
{"timestamp": "20:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh right yeah okay ."}

And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you ."}
{"timestamp": "21:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "21:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But you got a base ."}
{"timestamp": "21:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Do you think people'll really go for that though ?"}
{"timestamp": "21:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's useful for the remote phone ."}
{"timestamp": "21:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm . Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?"}
{"timestamp": "21:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "21:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base ."}
{"timestamp": "21:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "21:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery ."}
{"timestamp": "21:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "21:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "21:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that ."}
{"timestamp": "22:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "22:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Do w"}
{"timestamp": "22:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic ."}
{"timestamp": "22:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "22:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge"}
{"timestamp": "22:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You could um we could hook it up . Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "22:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So basically older people don't really care ."}
{"timestamp": "22:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and"}

{"timestamp": "22:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "23:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it ."}
{"timestamp": "23:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "23:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something ."}

{"timestamp": "24:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think people would find that too foreign ."}
{"timestamp": "24:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , that's true . And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "24:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's when we get satellite ."}
{"timestamp": "24:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . 'Kay . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "24:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "24:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour"}

{"timestamp": "27:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , you know ?"}

Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching ."}

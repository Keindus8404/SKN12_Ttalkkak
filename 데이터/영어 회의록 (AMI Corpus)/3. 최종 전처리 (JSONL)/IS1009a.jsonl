{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?"}

{"timestamp": "07:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system ."}
{"timestamp": "07:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Small , right . Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "08:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well ."}
{"timestamp": "08:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that ."}
{"timestamp": "08:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design ."}
{"timestamp": "08:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "08:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , of course ."}
{"timestamp": "08:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes , exactly ."}
{"timestamp": "08:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Are different shapes . Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah of course yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "09:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink ."}
{"timestamp": "09:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or a b"}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know ."}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Should ha"}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "A fluorescent signal , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "May not be beep ."}
{"timestamp": "09:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light ."}
{"timestamp": "09:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know ."}
{"timestamp": "10:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So the light sensor would activate the signal ."}
{"timestamp": "10:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "10:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it ."}
{"timestamp": "11:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly ."}
{"timestamp": "11:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I i we can't do it ."}
{"timestamp": "11:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here ."}
{"timestamp": "11:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , good point ."}
{"timestamp": "11:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? The industrial designer That's you ."}
{"timestamp": "11:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Me yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "11:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical ."}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back ."}
{"timestamp": "11:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design ."}
{"timestamp": "12:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price ."}
{"timestamp": "12:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "12:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "12:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So um we have well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . How about you people ? Really ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , even I have . Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah ."}

So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote ."}

{"timestamp": "14:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The margin will get too small . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty ."}

{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers ."}
{"timestamp": "15:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Scroll-wheel's one ."}
{"timestamp": "15:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then w"}

{"timestamp": "15:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We're getting closer ."}
{"timestamp": "15:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But how does scroll-wheel work here ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or maybe you can"}

{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So you won't need a button ."}
{"timestamp": "16:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think that would be like the end of our usability ."}

{"timestamp": "17:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button ."}

{"timestamp": "20:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we make one for the volume , one for the channel ."}
{"timestamp": "21:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want ."}

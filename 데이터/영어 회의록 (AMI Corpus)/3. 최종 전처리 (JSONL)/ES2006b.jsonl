I just sent at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control .

Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities ."}

So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something ."}

I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , but you know , it's up there . Um that yeah .

{"timestamp": "31:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky ."}

{"timestamp": "31:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there ."}

{"timestamp": "32:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "32:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself ."}
{"timestamp": "32:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm ."}

{"timestamp": "32:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is ."}

So it shows um and so if you if you think about how the old version happened , then you see it makes sense that words like prosody , just like a sing if that was the only utterance , then that probably scored quite well and stuff ."}

{"timestamp": "07:58", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm , I suppose it should depend on the length of the segment ."}
{"timestamp": "08:03", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Mm , I guess that would make more sense , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "09:22", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Um I suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can I can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display . Um yeah , probably ."}

{"timestamp": "10:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It'd probably be , yeah , best to make a copy of it ."}
{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I'd have thought ."}
{"timestamp": "11:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I don't think I'm gonna be able to do um the speech tools through Java native interface 'cause the documentation for them is horrific . It's really bad . So I think I'm thinking I'll just write out a script and do it with a system call ."}

{"timestamp": "11:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Not yet . Yeah , the I just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it ."}
{"timestamp": "11:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "11:24", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yes , it's not really important that we get it like nice and c clean or anything like that ."}

{"timestamp": "11:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , especially because I mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes , right ? So even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment and , you know , even if it pauses for ten seconds , well that's tough luck then . Uh , think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of . So th"}
{"timestamp": "11:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I don't think it would take that long anyway ."}
{"timestamp": "11:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah yeah . So yeah , it we just start everything after the summary's been created . It's not a big problem ."}
{"timestamp": "11:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Yeah , there's a wait for command for an external ca like for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that's sort of running parallel , I think . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that ."}
{"timestamp": "12:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um I don't think I'll need that really 'cause I'll just dump out a temporary file ."}
{"timestamp": "12:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , cool . Um I don't really know what to talk about ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end ."}
{"timestamp": "13:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "'Cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I uh think it might . Why , because um i um Steve lay quite a lot of um weight on um you know uh surfing through meetings ."}
{"timestamp": "13:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group . At the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that ."}
{"timestamp": "14:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I c"}
{"timestamp": "14:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "14:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting . Like ones that are red instead of black or something like that ."}
{"timestamp": "14:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . So just a little bit of ad additional information in the display that knows where meetings , picking it over , and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous I_D_s for the segments . Yeah , that works ."}
{"timestamp": "14:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm . So other than , yeah , other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing ."}
{"timestamp": "14:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes , but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting . Yeah , I completely agree . So the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries ."}
{"timestamp": "14:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . I mean that's quite a cheap way to do it ."}
{"timestamp": "14:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um and what about the similarity measure for segments ? Do we um also present that in this window , and do we do it across meetings ? Uh I think that was planned at the beginning , wasn't it ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , so the initially I thought it was sort of more a search functionality um that simply there's one button that says find similar segments , and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search ."}
{"timestamp": "15:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh okay . So it wouldn't be displayed in in the uh graphical display . Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "15:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well I'm not so you think displaying uh like an information about similarity to the select uh like to a selected meeting in to a selected segment in the other segments ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It might be possible to do it in the summariser ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but i it it should appear as a continuous thing f for the yeah . But I'm not I'm not sure if it's worth much bother though . Like if we do a s like a similarity search , and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment , I think that's quite useful um even without displaying them sort of dis-continuously ."}
{"timestamp": "16:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , it will still appear continuous on the display ."}
{"timestamp": "16:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "16:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So how are we gonna display the search for this corpus ?"}
{"timestamp": "16:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well I was thinking of just like really just a m more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever . We should aim to get some names for segments , like just some extraction of something that we can call . And if it's just the single highest um importance measure o phrase of a segment , so that we have something to display for them . Like basically just a summarisation down to one segment . And it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then w you tho you know , then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the nota notification , this gets the notification ."}
{"timestamp": "16:55", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:01", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , I think so ."}

{"timestamp": "17:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "17:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine . Because yours would sort of give just the segment I_D_s and mine would give the start segment I_D_s ."}
{"timestamp": "17:18", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:22", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "17:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts . Maybe se well maybe also something where something ends , like for mine , and some string that we pass to describe what like what it is . You wait , your search , what would it return ? Would it return just the specific like it would go right to the utterance , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "17:40", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:46", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , I suppose my search will r it returned the utterance , but if you're searching for a word , you need an index for the word and the utterance as well ."}
{"timestamp": "17:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah sure , sure sure . Um yeah . So in in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the u yeah . And in my case it would say some name for the segment , and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in . Like you c you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part ."}
{"timestamp": "18:01", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Um it p it'd probably select it , yeah . It would make sense to do that ."}
{"timestamp": "18:11", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . How advanced are we gonna have our search ? Because I definitely think we should restrict it to I think we should um be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that , but nothing too fancy ."}
{"timestamp": "18:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Do we have them with a speaker at the moment ?"}

{"timestamp": "18:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "19:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , it's um the data manager should be quite well documented . So you should be able to use that for the search quite easily ."}

{"timestamp": "19:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Just 'cause that was lower priority . But yeah , all the you can get all the utterances ."}
{"timestamp": "19:32", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah , yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "19:40", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Making a search with that ."}
{"timestamp": "19:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So what about a general layout like this that we have here , the dialogue acts and there the player b And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button ."}
{"timestamp": "19:52", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "19:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So where are gonna put the search results ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "If we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left . Yeah , like the search results in there ."}
{"timestamp": "20:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Yeah . I think we probably like we can leave those like I_ frames and just arrange them sort of . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:09", "speaker": "Speaker_E", "text": "Yeah ."}

So um at the moment I'm just whenever it needs to be repainted , I'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea . But until I think of something better , what I'll just do is I'll just I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length , but just some indicator somewhere .

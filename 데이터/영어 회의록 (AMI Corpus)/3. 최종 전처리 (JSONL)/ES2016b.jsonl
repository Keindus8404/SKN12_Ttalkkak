{"timestamp": "01:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long ."}
{"timestamp": "01:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want .

{"timestamp": "01:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And uh then we'll have the closing . Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um"}
{"timestamp": "02:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want ."}
{"timestamp": "02:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different ."}
{"timestamp": "03:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "03:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation ?"}

{"timestamp": "05:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and"}
{"timestamp": "05:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? Mm . I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then"}
{"timestamp": "05:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "have something yeah . Yeah . Oh well ."}
{"timestamp": "05:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "05:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "have them both up at the same time I think ."}
{"timestamp": "05:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research ."}
{"timestamp": "06:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say ."}
{"timestamp": "06:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important ."}
{"timestamp": "07:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Is is it j just just just using it yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently ."}
{"timestamp": "07:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button ."}
{"timestamp": "08:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote ."}
{"timestamp": "08:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ ."}
{"timestamp": "08:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "A repetitive strain injury ."}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What is it ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess ."}
{"timestamp": "08:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups ."}
{"timestamp": "09:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room ."}
{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition ."}
{"timestamp": "09:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "10:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Wait can I look at that real quick ? ."}
{"timestamp": "10:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? 'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say ."}
{"timestamp": "10:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design ."}
{"timestamp": "10:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control ."}
{"timestamp": "11:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself ,"}
{"timestamp": "12:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across ."}
{"timestamp": "13:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And then and change the fashion of remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "13:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "14:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i"}

{"timestamp": "15:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there .

{"timestamp": "15:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear .

{"timestamp": "17:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp"}

{"timestamp": "18:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there .

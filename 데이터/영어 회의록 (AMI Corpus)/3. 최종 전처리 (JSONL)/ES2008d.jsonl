{"timestamp": "00:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "welcome to our detailed design meeting . I'm pretty excited ."}
{"timestamp": "00:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that ."}
{"timestamp": "00:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close ."}
{"timestamp": "01:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , starting off with the um last the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu ."}
{"timestamp": "01:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels ."}
{"timestamp": "01:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first ."}
{"timestamp": "01:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right , do you wanna start ?"}
{"timestamp": "01:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one ."}
{"timestamp": "01:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your"}
{"timestamp": "02:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger ."}
{"timestamp": "02:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big ."}
{"timestamp": "02:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here ."}
{"timestamp": "02:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand ."}
{"timestamp": "03:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The little lightning bolt in it , very cute ."}
{"timestamp": "03:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We call that one the rhombus , uh the rhombus . Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's"}
{"timestamp": "03:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The v the rhombus rhombus ?"}
{"timestamp": "03:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That's the rhombus , yep ."}
{"timestamp": "03:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it's a how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um"}
{"timestamp": "03:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand ."}
{"timestamp": "03:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um"}
{"timestamp": "03:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here ."}
{"timestamp": "03:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected ."}
{"timestamp": "03:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select"}
{"timestamp": "04:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and that's basically it , that's the potato ."}
{"timestamp": "04:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um on , off ?"}
{"timestamp": "04:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "04:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "04:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah we turn it off ."}
{"timestamp": "04:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?"}
{"timestamp": "04:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off ."}
{"timestamp": "04:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "04:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "If you pressed and held it maybe ."}
{"timestamp": "04:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "04:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "If you like held it down , that would be on off ."}
{"timestamp": "04:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "04:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "On off , that's a possibility , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "04:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "04:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . We have the five preset seeds ."}
{"timestamp": "05:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Let's pass ."}
{"timestamp": "05:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh-huh ."}
{"timestamp": "05:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , I forgot ."}
{"timestamp": "05:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Very interesting . I think that one's my favourite ."}
{"timestamp": "05:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever ."}
{"timestamp": "06:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We were we were thinking that"}

{"timestamp": "06:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ,"}
{"timestamp": "06:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy ."}
{"timestamp": "06:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost ."}

{"timestamp": "06:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "06:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it ."}
{"timestamp": "07:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's true , mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip"}
{"timestamp": "07:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon ."}
{"timestamp": "07:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now ."}
{"timestamp": "08:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um ."}
{"timestamp": "08:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat ."}
{"timestamp": "08:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "08:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on ."}
{"timestamp": "08:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm yeah , that's good , that's good ."}
{"timestamp": "08:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah , there we go ."}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Here , stick it on ."}
{"timestamp": "09:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Sure ."}
{"timestamp": "09:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for ."}
{"timestamp": "09:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh okay . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so ."}
{"timestamp": "09:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do you need this or just write on the white board ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant ."}
{"timestamp": "09:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "09:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it ."}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hey ."}
{"timestamp": "09:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Maybe a little smaller than that ."}
{"timestamp": "09:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , I kinda like it . That's hard to miss ."}
{"timestamp": "09:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It makes look more fruity as well ."}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It's like a deformed foot , I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "09:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem ."}
{"timestamp": "09:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers ."}
{"timestamp": "10:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Interesting ."}
{"timestamp": "10:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I like this one ."}
{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one ."}
{"timestamp": "10:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Variety of colours are nice ."}
{"timestamp": "10:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think I'm leaning towards the potato ."}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu ."}
{"timestamp": "10:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level ."}
{"timestamp": "10:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Good point ."}
{"timestamp": "10:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh ."}
{"timestamp": "10:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something ."}
{"timestamp": "11:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ?"}
{"timestamp": "11:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Potato ."}
{"timestamp": "11:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately"}
{"timestamp": "11:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true"}
{"timestamp": "11:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective ."}
{"timestamp": "12:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion ."}
{"timestamp": "12:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two ."}
{"timestamp": "12:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , well give it a number , sorry ."}
{"timestamp": "12:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I will give it a one ."}
{"timestamp": "12:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use ."}
{"timestamp": "12:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two , because c unique ."}
{"timestamp": "12:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And two , awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one ."}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'll go for two ."}
{"timestamp": "13:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , one ."}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "One ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two ."}
{"timestamp": "13:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um functional ."}
{"timestamp": "13:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two ."}
{"timestamp": "13:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Awesome , okay . Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative ."}
{"timestamp": "13:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Did you give a functional ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , she said it was one . Um is it technologically innovative ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , the kinetic battery ."}
{"timestamp": "13:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I kinetic battery is a big one , so ."}
{"timestamp": "13:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "How many people would notice that , though ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "13:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But it but we know it's there ."}
{"timestamp": "13:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery ."}
{"timestamp": "14:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . I'll give it a three ."}
{"timestamp": "14:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just the material ."}
{"timestamp": "14:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's"}
{"timestamp": "14:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "different . But does that equal innovative ? I dunno . I'll give it a three ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "14:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Everyone else ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four ."}
{"timestamp": "14:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Think I'm gonna go with the four as well ."}
{"timestamp": "14:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I really like that kinetic battery though ."}
{"timestamp": "14:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Next , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . I think it's really easy to use . I'll give it a two ."}
{"timestamp": "14:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up ."}
{"timestamp": "14:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'll say one ."}
{"timestamp": "15:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Give it a one ."}
{"timestamp": "15:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I wonder if it bounces when you drop it ."}
{"timestamp": "15:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , ."}
{"timestamp": "15:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Iain , what do you give it ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah I'd I'd give it a one ."}
{"timestamp": "15:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? Well , is it gonna be yellow ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh um ."}
{"timestamp": "15:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity ."}
{"timestamp": "15:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We might wanna keep it yellow ."}
{"timestamp": "15:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something ."}
{"timestamp": "16:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sure ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Fruity , so fruity ."}
{"timestamp": "16:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity ."}

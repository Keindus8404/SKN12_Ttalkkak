{"timestamp": "06:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No , but Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six ."}
{"timestamp": "06:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so we drop the speech ."}
{"timestamp": "06:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose ."}

{"timestamp": "07:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . And then and the power button . So that's five ."}

{"timestamp": "07:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature .

{"timestamp": "10:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah we can't drop them ."}
{"timestamp": "10:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter ."}
{"timestamp": "11:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo ."}

{"timestamp": "11:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No y you would rec"}
{"timestamp": "11:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power ."}

{"timestamp": "11:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now ."}

{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Three . Up , down , Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options ."}

{"timestamp": "12:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "You you press it for like three seconds ."}

{"timestamp": "12:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button ."}

{"timestamp": "12:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess we have to ."}

{"timestamp": "12:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . You see ? Oh still Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option ."}
{"timestamp": "13:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No no , it has to be um curved ."}
{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?"}

{"timestamp": "13:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular ."}
{"timestamp": "13:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Just something else than than black or white I think ."}

{"timestamp": "14:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah or spe special form ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "21:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is ."}
{"timestamp": "21:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?"}

{"timestamp": "24:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , we can go to the next slide .

{"timestamp": "25:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker ."}

{"timestamp": "25:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside ."}
{"timestamp": "26:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide ."}
{"timestamp": "26:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us ."}
{"timestamp": "26:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device .

{"timestamp": "27:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No but I think just one fruit to control everything ."}

{"timestamp": "27:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there .

{"timestamp": "28:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "28:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know ."}

{"timestamp": "28:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits ."}
{"timestamp": "28:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "28:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote ."}
{"timestamp": "28:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's right . But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . So component cost is going to be the least .

{"timestamp": "28:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver ."}

{"timestamp": "30:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Let's move on . Uh uh yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . Go for it ."}

{"timestamp": "30:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay . Okay , so . Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . That's it . Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "30:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm okay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . That's all ? Okay , so mm so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , I do I don't remember you call it ?"}

{"timestamp": "31:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "banana shape ."}
{"timestamp": "31:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor ."}
{"timestamp": "32:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , right ."}
{"timestamp": "32:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What about what about this shape ?"}
{"timestamp": "32:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "More or less ."}
{"timestamp": "32:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "There's less space on this to put with the buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "32:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . So ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward .

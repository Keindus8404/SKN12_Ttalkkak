{"timestamp": "10:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find bec yeah bec"}
{"timestamp": "10:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I was thinking that too . I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T_V_ Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "10:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "11:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "11:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Maybe call is enough . But yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah yeah yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "13:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No it really wouldn't be ."}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno . Yeah . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . Yeah . Uh ."}

{"timestamp": "13:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Till the meeting oh right . This is what we have left ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So ."}
{"timestamp": "13:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I agree . B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything ."}
{"timestamp": "13:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , yeah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does ."}
{"timestamp": "14:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That would be cool ."}
{"timestamp": "14:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . I mean it just seems like yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s"}
{"timestamp": "14:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Select . Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen ."}
{"timestamp": "14:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's something we could decide . Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "14:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Because , I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as a screen ."}
{"timestamp": "14:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "14:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But yeah for sure . Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ?"}

{"timestamp": "15:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right . Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "15:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap ."}

{"timestamp": "15:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um but it's something to think about , yeah . I mean we'll have to see how much that would be ."}

Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material .

{"timestamp": "26:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well yeah , like the compass point one ."}
{"timestamp": "26:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic ."}
{"timestamp": "26:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top ."}
{"timestamp": "26:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case ."}
{"timestamp": "26:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "26:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , they could be plastic ."}
{"timestamp": "26:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement ."}
{"timestamp": "27:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's just one , isn't it ?"}

Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly .

{"timestamp": "09:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,"}

We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost .

{"timestamp": "12:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That was kind of what I found ."}
{"timestamp": "12:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important .

{"timestamp": "13:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange ."}
{"timestamp": "13:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely ."}

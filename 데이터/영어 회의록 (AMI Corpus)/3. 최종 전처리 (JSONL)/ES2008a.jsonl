Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting .

Um ."}
{"timestamp": "09:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume ."}

{"timestamp": "10:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing ."}

Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes .

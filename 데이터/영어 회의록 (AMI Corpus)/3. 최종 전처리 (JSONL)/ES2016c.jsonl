{"timestamp": "02:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um"}

{"timestamp": "03:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And that it should look different than what's out there ."}
{"timestamp": "03:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that"}
{"timestamp": "04:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different ."}
{"timestamp": "05:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also ."}
{"timestamp": "05:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Marketing ? We're watching trends . I suppose that you can have this ."}
{"timestamp": "05:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "05:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep . Can I have your cable please ? Thanks ."}
{"timestamp": "06:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay so I was looking at trend-watching ."}
{"timestamp": "06:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that ."}
{"timestamp": "06:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before ."}
{"timestamp": "07:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use ."}
{"timestamp": "07:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try ."}
{"timestamp": "07:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel ."}
{"timestamp": "08:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further ."}
{"timestamp": "08:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "09:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So that's that ."}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "09:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's what I was thinking yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "09:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy"}
{"timestamp": "10:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "various coverings ."}
{"timestamp": "10:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "What's it called ? Cust you personalised , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm various covers ."}
{"timestamp": "10:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Personalise your remote ."}
{"timestamp": "10:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "10:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Why can't I see the crazy . Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had ."}
{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices ."}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and"}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated ."}
{"timestamp": "12:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a there is a picture . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio ."}
{"timestamp": "12:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out ."}
{"timestamp": "13:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch ."}
{"timestamp": "13:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes ."}
{"timestamp": "13:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design ."}
{"timestamp": "14:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit ."}
{"timestamp": "14:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just ."}
{"timestamp": "15:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just to sort of show you ."}

{"timestamp": "16:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .

{"timestamp": "18:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that"}

{"timestamp": "19:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . Um the way it works is that you have the keys here .

So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive .

{"timestamp": "32:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case ."}
{"timestamp": "33:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Probably case um material . And probably a shape also ."}

{"timestamp": "34:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?"}

{"timestamp": "34:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well what about what you said , like putting the"}

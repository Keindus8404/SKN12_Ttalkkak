{"timestamp": "14:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice um and also be really durable ."}

{"timestamp": "14:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here .

{"timestamp": "14:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . Course ."}
{"timestamp": "14:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology .

{"timestamp": "15:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah 'cause that's ."}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet ."}

{"timestamp": "15:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I need a product . I need a product to market . And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with ."}

{"timestamp": "15:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So our big questions here really are"}
{"timestamp": "15:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?"}
{"timestamp": "16:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?"}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ?"}
{"timestamp": "16:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah wh wh what's the wh"}
{"timestamp": "16:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market ."}

{"timestamp": "16:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down ."}

{"timestamp": "17:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh"}
{"timestamp": "17:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "dock to put it in to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so ."}
{"timestamp": "17:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "17:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah yeah . I think it's that's right . I think so ."}
{"timestamp": "17:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle ."}

{"timestamp": "18:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness ."}

{"timestamp": "21:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote ."}

{"timestamp": "22:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost ."}
{"timestamp": "22:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh okay phew . I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost ."}

{"timestamp": "22:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No it's just different ."}
{"timestamp": "23:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna ."}

{"timestamp": "23:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control ."}

{"timestamp": "23:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That's true yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "24:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used ."}

{"timestamp": "24:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier ."}

{"timestamp": "24:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that ."}
{"timestamp": "24:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sure ."}
{"timestamp": "24:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "25:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be ."}

{"timestamp": "25:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons ."}

{"timestamp": "25:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's kinda cool actually . I like that ."}
{"timestamp": "25:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip ."}
{"timestamp": "26:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well there's ano"}
{"timestamp": "26:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well not n necessarily . You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . If you do that ."}
{"timestamp": "26:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's right ."}
{"timestamp": "26:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though ."}

{"timestamp": "26:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "26:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "26:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah I think so . I I think so . Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma ."}

{"timestamp": "27:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "27:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well that's quite cool . You'd need a display on the th the thing ."}

{"timestamp": "27:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah the the television can tell you . Can ."}
{"timestamp": "27:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "27:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ?"}
{"timestamp": "27:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well you just it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually .

{"timestamp": "27:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay okay ."}
{"timestamp": "28:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And then ."}
{"timestamp": "28:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . Yeah that's kinda cool . I like that ."}

{"timestamp": "28:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply ."}
{"timestamp": "28:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "28:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services ."}
{"timestamp": "28:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "28:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust ."}
{"timestamp": "28:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two ."}
{"timestamp": "28:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Making it last ."}
{"timestamp": "28:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other ."}
{"timestamp": "28:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So if there's a button for each type ."}
{"timestamp": "28:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels ."}
{"timestamp": "29:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah-ha okay ."}
{"timestamp": "29:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch ."}
{"timestamp": "29:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "29:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator"}
{"timestamp": "29:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah yeah the mode switch ."}
{"timestamp": "29:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just the lights behind the buttons . You could have back-lit buttons maybe ."}
{"timestamp": "29:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ okay ."}
{"timestamp": "29:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Would that work ? Is that okay we have five minutes . So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel ."}
{"timestamp": "29:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "29:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We want a mode indicator ."}
{"timestamp": "29:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We want back-lit buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "29:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that ."}
{"timestamp": "29:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that ."}
{"timestamp": "29:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think we are yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . Didn't you say so ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's what I mean . We can increase the cost ."}
{"timestamp": "30:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components .

{"timestamp": "30:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit ."}
{"timestamp": "30:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "30:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level ."}
{"timestamp": "31:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "We have to find cost ."}
{"timestamp": "31:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . I'm a student , but"}
{"timestamp": "31:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I'm just asking you ."}
{"timestamp": "31:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "on the other hand I would think ,"}
{"timestamp": "31:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh no no ."}
{"timestamp": "31:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I would say thirty five to forty ."}

{"timestamp": "32:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . So the question is what we ca we make it for ."}
{"timestamp": "32:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}

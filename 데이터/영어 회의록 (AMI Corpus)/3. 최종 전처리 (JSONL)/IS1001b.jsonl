So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house ."}

{"timestamp": "05:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing .

{"timestamp": "13:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah maybe this this is important . Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so ."}

{"timestamp": "16:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that"}

{"timestamp": "18:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ?"}

{"timestamp": "19:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Definitely ."}
{"timestamp": "19:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?"}
{"timestamp": "19:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I would say . I would say uh about eight months to have the first results ."}
{"timestamp": "19:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so i it's a bit long yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "19:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "19:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "One month for the standard one with button . Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ?"}

{"timestamp": "19:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now ."}
{"timestamp": "19:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um eight ."}
{"timestamp": "19:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "For uh speech recognition ."}
{"timestamp": "19:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "19:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?"}
{"timestamp": "20:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But we don't have time to market ."}
{"timestamp": "20:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And also how much uh I think"}

{"timestamp": "20:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Euros . Yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "20:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros ."}
{"timestamp": "20:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but how many yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "25:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "26:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera ."}

{"timestamp": "27:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ?"}

{"timestamp": "27:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Maybe . So few buttons , channel ,"}
{"timestamp": "27:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "volume control"}
{"timestamp": "27:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "and what el what function do you see"}
{"timestamp": "27:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see"}

{"timestamp": "28:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back ."}

{"timestamp": "28:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button .

{"timestamp": "28:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "28:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . I I talk about that , yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "28:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "How should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental ."}
{"timestamp": "28:57", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them ."}
{"timestamp": "29:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "29:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five ."}

{"timestamp": "29:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory"}
{"timestamp": "29:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No . Doesn't work does it ."}
{"timestamp": "29:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . Change channel to eight ."}
{"timestamp": "29:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental ."}
{"timestamp": "30:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "30:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .

{"timestamp": "31:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , a kind of joystick ."}

{"timestamp": "31:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah ? The channels change one by one . So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit ."}

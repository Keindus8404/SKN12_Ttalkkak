{"timestamp": "25:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle ."}
{"timestamp": "25:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But how do you wanna solve it ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "With the switch button ."}
{"timestamp": "26:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy ."}
{"timestamp": "26:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down ."}
{"timestamp": "26:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "26:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "27:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And No , no . It won't work ."}
{"timestamp": "27:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "For the young peoples I think scroll button's good ."}
{"timestamp": "27:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Uh-huh ."}
{"timestamp": "27:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Think we have to keep them ."}
{"timestamp": "27:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or a remote control more like joystick ."}
{"timestamp": "27:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better ."}
{"timestamp": "27:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "A small one ."}
{"timestamp": "27:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k"}

{"timestamp": "27:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "not so big ."}
{"timestamp": "27:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing ."}

{"timestamp": "27:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "28:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one ."}
{"timestamp": "28:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , please look at it ."}
{"timestamp": "28:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?"}
{"timestamp": "28:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh they're not uh"}
{"timestamp": "28:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah we I think you get it ."}
{"timestamp": "28:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it ."}
{"timestamp": "29:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "29:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs ."}
{"timestamp": "29:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Your problem . Not mine ."}
{"timestamp": "29:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then I'll uh make something up ."}
{"timestamp": "29:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So , do we have other concepts ?"}
{"timestamp": "29:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then for the components ,"}
{"timestamp": "29:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "we use a normal battery ."}
{"timestamp": "29:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Ch cheapest way , I think ."}
{"timestamp": "29:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery ."}
{"timestamp": "29:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:42", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "29:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "29:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "29:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ ."}
{"timestamp": "29:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Depends on the scroll ."}
{"timestamp": "30:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Scroll ."}
{"timestamp": "30:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to"}
{"timestamp": "30:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh the most expensive . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "If we Yeah . If we No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip ."}
{"timestamp": "30:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So , uh the shapes of the"}
{"timestamp": "30:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "depends on the L_C_D_ and But ,"}
{"timestamp": "30:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "it has to be small ."}
{"timestamp": "30:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think ."}
{"timestamp": "30:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy ."}
{"timestamp": "30:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just use your thumb ."}

{"timestamp": "31:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen ."}
{"timestamp": "31:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh straight ."}
{"timestamp": "31:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No . No , no ."}
{"timestamp": "31:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think ."}
{"timestamp": "31:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y"}
{"timestamp": "31:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "N well , if you have to look at it ."}
{"timestamp": "31:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "'Kay . Here's our designer ."}
{"timestamp": "31:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ ."}
{"timestamp": "31:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then it goes like this ."}
{"timestamp": "32:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , why not ."}
{"timestamp": "32:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , of course . That's good good . But the um , it may not break ."}
{"timestamp": "32:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Now we put uh rubber around it ."}
{"timestamp": "32:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . If that's possible ."}
{"timestamp": "32:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um , Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber ."}
{"timestamp": "32:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "32:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or you can uh"}
{"timestamp": "32:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "turn it inside ."}
{"timestamp": "32:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it ."}

{"timestamp": "32:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , that's true ."}
{"timestamp": "32:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "This is something new ."}
{"timestamp": "32:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , um we have one minute ."}

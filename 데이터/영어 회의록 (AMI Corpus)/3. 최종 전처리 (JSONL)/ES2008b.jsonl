{"timestamp": "04:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .

{"timestamp": "04:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions ."}

{"timestamp": "05:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know ."}

{"timestamp": "06:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah . There we go . Wow . People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote ."}
{"timestamp": "06:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on ."}
{"timestamp": "07:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on"}
{"timestamp": "07:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that ."}

{"timestamp": "09:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um ."}
{"timestamp": "09:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness ."}
{"timestamp": "10:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product ."}
{"timestamp": "10:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "10:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about"}
{"timestamp": "10:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,"}
{"timestamp": "10:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "and different different people sort of prefer different things ."}
{"timestamp": "11:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out ."}
{"timestamp": "11:33", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product ."}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "12:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two ."}
{"timestamp": "13:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed ."}
{"timestamp": "14:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful . It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "14:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "14:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . I think that could be our selling point ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "A fashion fashion remote ."}
{"timestamp": "14:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress ."}
{"timestamp": "14:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "14:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "14:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already ."}
{"timestamp": "14:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Lovely ."}
{"timestamp": "14:52", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "14:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , how do I play again ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um the it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s ."}
{"timestamp": "15:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function ."}
{"timestamp": "15:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points"}
{"timestamp": "16:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted"}
{"timestamp": "16:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh . Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "16:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You just press yeah , just click . That'll be fine ."}
{"timestamp": "16:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial ."}
{"timestamp": "17:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings"}
{"timestamp": "17:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh ."}
{"timestamp": "18:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous ."}
{"timestamp": "18:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Previous ."}
{"timestamp": "18:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Sorry about that , guys ."}
{"timestamp": "18:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "18:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh , well . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "18:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , no , no , no , no . Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here ."}
{"timestamp": "18:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Double click on it ."}
{"timestamp": "18:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "With the right with the left hand one ."}
{"timestamp": "18:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "W yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again . There we are . Sorry about this , guys . I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated ."}
{"timestamp": "19:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "19:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design ."}

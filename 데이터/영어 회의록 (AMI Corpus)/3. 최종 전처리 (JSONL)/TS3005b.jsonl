And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it .

Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore .

Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera .

Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much ."}

Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .

{"timestamp": "37:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . No ."}
{"timestamp": "37:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "37:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No you just tap I think ."}
{"timestamp": "37:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , you tap . Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on ."}
{"timestamp": "37:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Just tap it ."}

{"timestamp": "38:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , yeah . To turn it on ."}
{"timestamp": "38:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen ."}
{"timestamp": "38:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on ."}
{"timestamp": "38:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I have , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?"}
{"timestamp": "38:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want ."}
{"timestamp": "38:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button ."}

{"timestamp": "39:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "39:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Okay , well I guess we have to"}

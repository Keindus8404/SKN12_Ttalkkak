{"timestamp": "35:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?"}
{"timestamp": "35:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:20", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost ."}

{"timestamp": "36:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , are we looking at voice ?"}
{"timestamp": "36:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , is that right ?"}
{"timestamp": "36:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains ."}
{"timestamp": "36:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "For l yeah , the whistle . So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle ."}
{"timestamp": "36:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And incorporating the company logo ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "37:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design ."}
{"timestamp": "37:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm . 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "37:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well they do , but I think we can you could well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that ."}
{"timestamp": "37:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours ."}

{"timestamp": "37:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:48", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so"}
{"timestamp": "37:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , depending on the expense of it ."}
{"timestamp": "37:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And they've got in stock , so yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "37:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . Right I'm going to wrap it up there ."}
{"timestamp": "38:08", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "38:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back ."}
{"timestamp": "38:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "You got to go through ."}
{"timestamp": "38:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's either that or"}

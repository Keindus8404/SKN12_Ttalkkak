{"timestamp": "01:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "02:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "02:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . So But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard ."}

{"timestamp": "03:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "03:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand ."}
{"timestamp": "03:57", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction ."}

{"timestamp": "05:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "05:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium"}

{"timestamp": "06:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That's true , I guess . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "06:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , maybe a little bit expensive ."}

{"timestamp": "08:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep ."}

{"timestamp": "11:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Huh ."}
{"timestamp": "12:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think it depends on the function ."}

{"timestamp": "16:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour .

It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know ."}

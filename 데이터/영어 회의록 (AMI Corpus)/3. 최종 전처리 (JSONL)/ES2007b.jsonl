{"timestamp": "13:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .

{"timestamp": "14:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I would say"}
{"timestamp": "15:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "If it's simple to do ,"}

Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .

Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy .

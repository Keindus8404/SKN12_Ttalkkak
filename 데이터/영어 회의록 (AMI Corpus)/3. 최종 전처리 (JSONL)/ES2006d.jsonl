So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here ."}

It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one .

{"timestamp": "05:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?"}
{"timestamp": "05:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?"}

{"timestamp": "06:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess ."}
{"timestamp": "06:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . But yeah , uh that's cool , cool ."}
{"timestamp": "06:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Very good . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow ."}

{"timestamp": "08:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot ."}
{"timestamp": "08:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , just prepare one now ."}

{"timestamp": "09:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh we're all so proud of the . Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in ."}
{"timestamp": "09:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Ah , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "09:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . But that's alright . If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I would think yes , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it does ."}
{"timestamp": "09:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger ."}
{"timestamp": "10:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one ."}
{"timestamp": "10:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "10:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family ."}
{"timestamp": "10:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But then yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable ."}
{"timestamp": "10:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen ."}
{"timestamp": "10:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue ."}
{"timestamp": "10:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "10:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? What do you what do you all think ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "11:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy ."}
{"timestamp": "11:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oops ."}
{"timestamp": "11:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top ."}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "11:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The length is gonna be difficu"}
{"timestamp": "11:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?"}
{"timestamp": "11:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "S uh slightly smaller ."}
{"timestamp": "11:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So you have to keep that side flat ."}
{"timestamp": "11:44", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that ."}
{"timestamp": "11:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work ."}
{"timestamp": "11:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . Um okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? To make it beep . Or a buzzer ."}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "12:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot ."}

{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "12:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to ."}

{"timestamp": "12:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Intuitive ."}
{"timestamp": "12:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , and I mean d"}
{"timestamp": "12:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it ."}
{"timestamp": "13:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon ."}

{"timestamp": "13:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yep ."}

{"timestamp": "14:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yep . But otherwise it's superb ."}

{"timestamp": "14:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Six ."}
{"timestamp": "14:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? See ."}

{"timestamp": "14:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Voice control have seven ."}
{"timestamp": "14:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide ."}
{"timestamp": "15:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh okay , cool . Um right , so ."}
{"timestamp": "15:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it has voice control ."}

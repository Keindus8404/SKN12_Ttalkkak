Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,"}
{"timestamp": "05:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um . There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um .

So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .

The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each .

Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .

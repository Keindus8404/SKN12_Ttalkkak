Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right .

Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue ."}

{"timestamp": "04:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um ,"}

Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together ."}

{"timestamp": "10:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting ."}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is ."}
{"timestamp": "10:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall ."}
{"timestamp": "11:26", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip ,"}
{"timestamp": "11:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up ."}
{"timestamp": "12:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation ."}

{"timestamp": "13:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the"}

{"timestamp": "15:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it ."}

{"timestamp": "15:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I'm happy with that . Completely ."}
{"timestamp": "15:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hu yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself ."}
{"timestamp": "15:44", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably ."}

{"timestamp": "16:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "16:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote ."}
{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?"}
{"timestamp": "16:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button ."}
{"timestamp": "16:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So it's now like a two-part thing . Okay . Alright ."}
{"timestamp": "16:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , so it would be a two part package ."}
{"timestamp": "16:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we get to design that too . Make it fashionable ."}

Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint ."}

{"timestamp": "02:02", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit ."}

{"timestamp": "03:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well ."}

{"timestamp": "03:37", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed ."}

{"timestamp": "04:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way ."}

{"timestamp": "04:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Because you can't really see which way round it is ."}

It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .

We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down .

We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton ."}

It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Sounds brilliant to me ."}

I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno .

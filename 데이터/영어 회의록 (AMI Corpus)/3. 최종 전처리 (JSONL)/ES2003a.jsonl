As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart ."}

{"timestamp": "12:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket ."}
{"timestamp": "13:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion ."}

{"timestamp": "13:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion .

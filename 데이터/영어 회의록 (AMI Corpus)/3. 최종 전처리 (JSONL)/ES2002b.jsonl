Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time .

{"timestamp": "01:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design ."}

{"timestamp": "09:19", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip .

{"timestamp": "14:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Dunno . Okay . Um . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them ."}

And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um"}

{"timestamp": "16:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um ."}

{"timestamp": "17:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through ."}

That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .

I it you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .

I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .

I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands ."}

{"timestamp": "13:14", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission ."}
{"timestamp": "13:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ?"}

{"timestamp": "14:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah f uh I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen .

So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe ."}

It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so .

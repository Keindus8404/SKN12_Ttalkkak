Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close ."}
{"timestamp": "01:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station ."}

{"timestamp": "02:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of ."}
{"timestamp": "03:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic ."}
{"timestamp": "04:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up ."}
{"timestamp": "04:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "04:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery ."}
{"timestamp": "05:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "05:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . So those are our options ."}
{"timestamp": "05:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything"}
{"timestamp": "05:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "05:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ .

{"timestamp": "10:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people ."}
{"timestamp": "10:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool ."}
{"timestamp": "11:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So basically , that's what we don't want . M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple ."}
{"timestamp": "11:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Here's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um the thing I like about this is that"}
{"timestamp": "11:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um"}
{"timestamp": "12:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:51", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored ."}
{"timestamp": "13:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod ."}
{"timestamp": "13:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device .

{"timestamp": "14:00", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?"}
{"timestamp": "14:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think that's that's one way to go , yes . Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "14:37", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display ."}

{"timestamp": "15:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . I mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up ."}

I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? And then you could still have that available ."}

{"timestamp": "29:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll ."}
{"timestamp": "29:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel ."}
{"timestamp": "29:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "30:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "30:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not ."}
{"timestamp": "30:22", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case ."}

{"timestamp": "30:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing ."}

{"timestamp": "30:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing ."}
{"timestamp": "30:46", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us ."}

{"timestamp": "31:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Fruity colours . Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose ."}
{"timestamp": "31:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I'm thinking curved of some sort ."}

{"timestamp": "31:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So push or scroll , right ? Or both ?"}
{"timestamp": "32:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button .

I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case"}

{"timestamp": "33:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "33:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "33:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?"}

{"timestamp": "33:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through ."}

But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option ."}

Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .

Anything I've missed ? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead ."}

{"timestamp": "09:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , so let me see , what are we I mean oh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out ."}
{"timestamp": "09:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Two point three ? Four point three no ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits ."}

{"timestamp": "01:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So what are our findings ? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls ."}

The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are .

Well just um if there's like three of the top meetings , like like we said before , language , we're looking for the l word language and get the highest-rated ones . To actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six I mean or seventy five , whatever it is . Um so the r the results from that will , you know , narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search . Then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen . And if we can yeah .

{"timestamp": "02:23", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes . Exactly . So we can go to next . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean . Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "03:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , because Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now ."}

{"timestamp": "03:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay . Awesome . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product ."}

{"timestamp": "05:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , um looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide ."}
{"timestamp": "05:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Sure ."}
{"timestamp": "05:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and"}
{"timestamp": "06:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of"}
{"timestamp": "06:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "look into it , but Anyway , next ."}
{"timestamp": "06:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm 'kay ."}
{"timestamp": "06:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up ."}
{"timestamp": "07:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "07:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "08:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "uh keep them away from other channels ."}
{"timestamp": "08:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "08:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction ."}

{"timestamp": "09:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said Next slide , please ."}

Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself ."}

Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it ."}

{"timestamp": "11:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium . Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .

{"timestamp": "12:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone .

{"timestamp": "23:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ?"}

{"timestamp": "24:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , I like that . 'Kay ."}
{"timestamp": "24:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled ."}
{"timestamp": "24:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "24:22", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , like on the side of it . Oh if it's just up and down ."}

{"timestamp": "24:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Do we have both sides ?"}
{"timestamp": "24:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know ."}

{"timestamp": "24:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah . That's squishy . That's squishy ."}

{"timestamp": "24:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side ."}
{"timestamp": "24:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "24:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "25:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get"}
{"timestamp": "25:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Which button ?"}

{"timestamp": "25:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea ."}

{"timestamp": "25:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ? They're not titanium . I kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool ."}

{"timestamp": "26:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "26:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Why ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , buttons wear off ."}
{"timestamp": "26:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "What's the button Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "26:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing ."}

{"timestamp": "26:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "27:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I can find it again ."}

{"timestamp": "27:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Um ."}
{"timestamp": "27:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in ."}

{"timestamp": "28:35", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . Well , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons ."}

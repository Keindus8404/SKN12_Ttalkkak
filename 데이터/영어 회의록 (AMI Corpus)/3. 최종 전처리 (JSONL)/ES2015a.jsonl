{"timestamp": "12:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Alrighty . I feel like a robot . Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that ."}
{"timestamp": "12:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "At first I thought it was a dead leaf . And then it landed on the wall next to me .

{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go ."}
{"timestamp": "13:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Great ."}
{"timestamp": "13:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "13:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um"}
{"timestamp": "13:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um"}
{"timestamp": "14:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents ."}
{"timestamp": "15:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty ."}
{"timestamp": "15:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I'm bad at math . 'Kay . Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um"}
{"timestamp": "15:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um"}

{"timestamp": "15:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:45", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing ."}
{"timestamp": "15:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? So maybe if you could have some kind of"}
{"timestamp": "16:06", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost ."}
{"timestamp": "16:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea ."}
{"timestamp": "16:20", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Do yous not find that , um ,"}

{"timestamp": "16:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "16:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . That's useful . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button ."}
{"timestamp": "16:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:40", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "17:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there ."}

{"timestamp": "18:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You'll be beginning your , your working design . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 'Kay ."}

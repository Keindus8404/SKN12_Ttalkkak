{"timestamp": "05:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "07:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking ,"}
{"timestamp": "07:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "07:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you ."}
{"timestamp": "08:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , and it's po"}
{"timestamp": "08:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "B as soon as possible ."}
{"timestamp": "08:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money ,"}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again ."}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know ."}
{"timestamp": "09:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams ."}
{"timestamp": "09:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , I'll get back to you on that ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes . Thank you ."}
{"timestamp": "09:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this ."}
{"timestamp": "09:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "09:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use ."}
{"timestamp": "10:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it ."}
{"timestamp": "10:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow ."}
{"timestamp": "10:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th"}
{"timestamp": "10:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "11:00", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That that's"}
{"timestamp": "11:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company ."}
{"timestamp": "11:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually ."}
{"timestamp": "11:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan ."}
{"timestamp": "11:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know ."}
{"timestamp": "12:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , I can coordinate , or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:09", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Very good ."}
{"timestamp": "12:15", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "12:15", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Between uh all the coor"}
{"timestamp": "12:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that ."}
{"timestamp": "12:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it ."}
{"timestamp": "12:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Th Christine , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "12:57", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "12:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm . Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit ."}
{"timestamp": "13:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "13:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "13:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "13:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account ."}
{"timestamp": "13:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "13:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening ."}
{"timestamp": "13:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , of course ."}
{"timestamp": "13:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around ."}

{"timestamp": "13:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "13:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or okay ."}

{"timestamp": "14:01", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things ."}
{"timestamp": "14:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}

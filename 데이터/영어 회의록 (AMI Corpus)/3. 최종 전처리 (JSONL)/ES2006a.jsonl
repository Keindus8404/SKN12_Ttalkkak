{"timestamp": "00:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm , yeah . I didn't receive it yet ."}
{"timestamp": "00:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Maybe not . Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it ."}
{"timestamp": "00:49", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "01:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five ."}

{"timestamp": "01:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Not at this point ."}
{"timestamp": "01:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product ."}
{"timestamp": "02:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that ."}
{"timestamp": "02:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together ."}
{"timestamp": "03:01", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together ."}

{"timestamp": "03:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing ."}
{"timestamp": "03:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "03:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "How how it will be done ."}
{"timestamp": "03:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?"}
{"timestamp": "04:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "04:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself .

Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part .

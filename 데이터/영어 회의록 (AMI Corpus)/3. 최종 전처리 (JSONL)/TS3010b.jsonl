{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's I think it's easier ."}

{"timestamp": "10:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "11:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?"}
{"timestamp": "12:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much ."}

{"timestamp": "12:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it ."}
{"timestamp": "12:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah but are their"}
{"timestamp": "12:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "profits bigger than their cost ?"}

{"timestamp": "12:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah but there are also design cost ."}
{"timestamp": "12:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?"}

{"timestamp": "16:41", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "17:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not ."}
{"timestamp": "17:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "17:27", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy ."}
{"timestamp": "17:42", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings ."}
{"timestamp": "17:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection ."}
{"timestamp": "18:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important ."}
{"timestamp": "18:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings ."}
{"timestamp": "18:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups ."}
{"timestamp": "18:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it ."}
{"timestamp": "19:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it ."}
{"timestamp": "19:25", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it ."}
{"timestamp": "19:43", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here ."}
{"timestamp": "20:10", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And um they are more critical on their money spending ."}
{"timestamp": "20:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent ."}
{"timestamp": "20:39", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at ."}
{"timestamp": "20:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use ,"}
{"timestamp": "21:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested ."}
{"timestamp": "21:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition ."}
{"timestamp": "21:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "21:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "You can find most functions on a T_V_ set ."}
{"timestamp": "21:56", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness ."}
{"timestamp": "22:03", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one ."}
{"timestamp": "22:18", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that ."}
{"timestamp": "22:33", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "That were my findings ."}
{"timestamp": "22:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay thank you . Yes ."}

There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already ."}

{"timestamp": "10:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production .

You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ?

That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented ."}
{"timestamp": "32:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus ."}

Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition ."}

{"timestamp": "34:08", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "we can"}

{"timestamp": "34:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive .

{"timestamp": "34:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Me too . I mean we all do . Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible ."}

{"timestamp": "35:52", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So a transmitter here . Anyway ."}
{"timestamp": "35:56", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here ."}
{"timestamp": "36:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ? It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top ."}
{"timestamp": "36:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Me too ."}
{"timestamp": "36:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Ah but ."}
{"timestamp": "36:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?"}
{"timestamp": "36:31", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "But nee the function of it . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot ."}
{"timestamp": "36:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but why I I'm not sure ."}
{"timestamp": "36:41", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand ."}
{"timestamp": "36:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like ."}
{"timestamp": "36:44", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "36:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No . M I personally would prefer it on the top ."}
{"timestamp": "36:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You would prefer it n Okay . So we have three people saying it should be on top ."}
{"timestamp": "36:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "36:54", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Huh ."}
{"timestamp": "36:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Anyways ."}
{"timestamp": "37:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "37:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's expensive to build it , so"}
{"timestamp": "37:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "37:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "you must use the maximum of it ."}

{"timestamp": "37:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "37:12", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "They want it uh ."}
{"timestamp": "37:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Huh ."}
{"timestamp": "37:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space ."}
{"timestamp": "37:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So I have to look if that's possible ."}
{"timestamp": "37:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I know uh ."}
{"timestamp": "37:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ?"}
{"timestamp": "37:47", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "In middle of it ."}
{"timestamp": "37:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example ."}
{"timestamp": "37:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "In the middle ."}
{"timestamp": "37:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "37:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function ."}
{"timestamp": "38:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's the most import yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "38:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , that would make them quite small . So maybe you'd put them here ."}
{"timestamp": "38:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like ."}
{"timestamp": "38:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "38:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . That might be an option ."}
{"timestamp": "38:33", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely ."}
{"timestamp": "38:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . But it has to be a little bit heavier ."}
{"timestamp": "38:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big ."}
{"timestamp": "38:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "38:49", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "No , but the things behind it . space ."}
{"timestamp": "38:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm let's see ."}
{"timestamp": "38:55", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Like a process uh ."}
{"timestamp": "38:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Finish meeting now . It's on your computer ."}
{"timestamp": "39:02", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "We either we have to decide what what people want . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one ."}
{"timestamp": "39:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I like this one more ."}
{"timestamp": "39:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down ,"}
{"timestamp": "39:24", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh ."}
{"timestamp": "39:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "39:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "and volume here ."}
{"timestamp": "39:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Let's see what we have here ."}
{"timestamp": "39:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , yeah , but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . I think it's L_C_D_ is better now ."}
{"timestamp": "39:45", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "39:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes ."}
{"timestamp": "39:48", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "40:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , let's think of a name , okay ."}
{"timestamp": "40:08", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh okay ."}
{"timestamp": "40:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , good ."}

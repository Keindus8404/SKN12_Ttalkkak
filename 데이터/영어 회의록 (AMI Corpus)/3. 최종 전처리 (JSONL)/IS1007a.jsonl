{"timestamp": "08:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list .

{"timestamp": "08:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly ."}
{"timestamp": "08:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Like s uh you you you say we can use speech ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "You can use uh well for example anything . The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno"}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I'm a okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it ."}
{"timestamp": "09:09", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "In the hand ."}

{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . So it's more powerful ."}
{"timestamp": "09:48", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "On the content ."}

{"timestamp": "09:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "10:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the to this remote control . And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons ."}
{"timestamp": "10:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "10:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}

{"timestamp": "11:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "11:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}

{"timestamp": "11:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "11:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . Five minutes ."}

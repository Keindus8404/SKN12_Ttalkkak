{"timestamp": "14:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate"}

We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one ."}

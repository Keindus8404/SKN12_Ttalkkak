So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting ."}

{"timestamp": "03:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . Okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one ."}

{"timestamp": "12:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros ."}
{"timestamp": "12:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Excuse me ."}
{"timestamp": "12:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , that's . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe ."}
{"timestamp": "12:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Piece of cake ."}
{"timestamp": "12:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry ."}
{"timestamp": "12:36", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh easy ."}
{"timestamp": "12:38", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So can someone make a"}
{"timestamp": "12:41", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls ."}
{"timestamp": "12:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh yeah , that's a good question ."}
{"timestamp": "13:06", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart ."}
{"timestamp": "13:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , it probably would be universal ."}
{"timestamp": "13:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Universal . And only television ? Or more devices ?"}
{"timestamp": "13:31", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm , maybe , I don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "13:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros"}
{"timestamp": "13:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect ."}
{"timestamp": "13:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , I think ."}
{"timestamp": "13:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Ah okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:41", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "13:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Not just a T_V_ ."}
{"timestamp": "13:53", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , just everything ."}
{"timestamp": "13:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "13:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "14:03", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well we can try to make it special ."}
{"timestamp": "14:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it"}
{"timestamp": "14:32", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons ."}
{"timestamp": "14:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality ."}
{"timestamp": "14:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:04", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's right . Should be a good point ."}
{"timestamp": "15:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And how big should it be ?"}
{"timestamp": "15:16", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It shouldn't be too big , but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so ."}
{"timestamp": "15:22", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think ."}
{"timestamp": "15:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it ."}
{"timestamp": "15:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah . Or we have to make something uh"}
{"timestamp": "15:34", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,"}
{"timestamp": "15:38", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "15:45", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "maybe more trendy ."}
{"timestamp": "15:47", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Okay , yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , if you just okay ."}
{"timestamp": "15:53", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah n"}
{"timestamp": "15:55", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often ."}
{"timestamp": "15:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah right right ."}
{"timestamp": "15:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , or you c"}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh that's good , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control ."}
{"timestamp": "16:12", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? There are buttons on it ."}
{"timestamp": "16:17", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "No you can make an uh manual in it ."}
{"timestamp": "16:21", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small ."}
{"timestamp": "16:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "16:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , but"}
{"timestamp": "16:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it ."}
{"timestamp": "16:28", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would ."}
{"timestamp": "16:28", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "But that's Yeah , I think it's much uh too expensive ."}
{"timestamp": "16:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken ."}
{"timestamp": "16:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "16:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile ."}
{"timestamp": "16:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , too fragile ."}
{"timestamp": "16:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "16:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Kid-proof ."}
{"timestamp": "17:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries ."}
{"timestamp": "17:07", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ma maybe a home station ."}
{"timestamp": "17:09", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think ."}
{"timestamp": "17:16", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?"}
{"timestamp": "17:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "17:19", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?"}
{"timestamp": "17:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I dunno ."}
{"timestamp": "17:25", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing ."}
{"timestamp": "17:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Ah yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive ."}
{"timestamp": "17:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah , that's right , yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "17:54", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive ."}
{"timestamp": "17:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately ."}
{"timestamp": "18:00", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:01", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "You can yeah , you can buy it with it ."}
{"timestamp": "18:08", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Rechargeable ."}
{"timestamp": "18:09", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so ."}
{"timestamp": "18:13", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "18:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "The option , just the option , that's cool ."}
{"timestamp": "18:18", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}

{"timestamp": "03:31", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Anyway . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "03:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions ."}
{"timestamp": "03:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only ."}
{"timestamp": "04:27", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .

{"timestamp": "09:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user .

{"timestamp": "27:53", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that .

Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there ."}
{"timestamp": "28:30", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "28:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it ."}

Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .

{"timestamp": "21:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option ."}
{"timestamp": "21:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . Sorted . We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition ."}

Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?"}
{"timestamp": "22:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery ."}

Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light .

{"timestamp": "22:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something ."}

{"timestamp": "23:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point ."}

{"timestamp": "23:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , right ."}
{"timestamp": "23:54", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well ."}

{"timestamp": "24:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out ."}
{"timestamp": "24:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time ."}

I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . And um Ron if you can"}

{"timestamp": "31:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple .

{"timestamp": "32:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?"}

{"timestamp": "01:10", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly ."}
{"timestamp": "01:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here ."}
{"timestamp": "02:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing ."}

I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote ."}
{"timestamp": "05:51", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No , that's good ."}
{"timestamp": "06:48", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So ."}
{"timestamp": "07:06", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Now ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? One remote for everything ."}
{"timestamp": "07:13", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "07:16", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?"}
{"timestamp": "07:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "07:27", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly ."}
{"timestamp": "07:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , TiVo ."}
{"timestamp": "07:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "TiVo ."}
{"timestamp": "07:30", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But it's still there , so"}
{"timestamp": "07:32", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "07:34", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal ."}
{"timestamp": "07:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club ."}
{"timestamp": "07:46", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know ."}
{"timestamp": "07:50", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals ."}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "07:55", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways ."}
{"timestamp": "07:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:05", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . Yeah . Ones that ones that look high-tech , too ."}
{"timestamp": "08:20", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "They want like the flashy lights . Oh like this came from Las Vegas ."}
{"timestamp": "08:26", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "But at the same time are simple ."}
{"timestamp": "08:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right . So that people like my mother can use it ."}
{"timestamp": "08:28", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:29", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "08:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . That's true ."}
{"timestamp": "08:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Um ."}
{"timestamp": "08:49", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "08:52", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Double A_ ."}
{"timestamp": "08:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Double A_ ."}
{"timestamp": "08:55", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do some of them use triple A_s though ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah some use triple A_s . So double or triple ?"}
{"timestamp": "08:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "09:03", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "09:11", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "09:15", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ ."}
{"timestamp": "09:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Triple A . But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . Hey . Anything else ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Can you with a small lithium battery ?"}
{"timestamp": "09:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Alright . Moving along ."}
{"timestamp": "09:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification ."}
{"timestamp": "10:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "10:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay . And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?"}
{"timestamp": "10:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "10:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay . This meeting is officially over ."}

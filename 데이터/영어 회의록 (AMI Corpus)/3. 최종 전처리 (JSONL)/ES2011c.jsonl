{"timestamp": "03:10", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .

{"timestamp": "03:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .

{"timestamp": "03:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .

{"timestamp": "16:59", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "So , but oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date ."}

{"timestamp": "23:01", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case ."}
{"timestamp": "23:04", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:05", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:05", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off ."}

{"timestamp": "23:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "23:13", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , I think , um"}
{"timestamp": "23:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit ."}
{"timestamp": "23:31", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again ."}
{"timestamp": "23:36", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "23:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No but it does it automatically . Does it automatically ? I don't know ."}

{"timestamp": "23:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . But if someone components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . Was that you ? Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about"}
{"timestamp": "23:49", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "23:54", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "That was me ."}
{"timestamp": "23:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "24:04", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches ."}
{"timestamp": "24:11", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Oh , a dynamo is ah , it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy ."}
{"timestamp": "24:20", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . So I sort of picked battery . We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways ."}
{"timestamp": "24:26", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "It's quite sweet ."}
{"timestamp": "24:38", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways ."}
{"timestamp": "24:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No . But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own ."}
{"timestamp": "24:50", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "24:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost ."}
{"timestamp": "24:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:02", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Don't know the cost ."}
{"timestamp": "25:04", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:07", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost ."}
{"timestamp": "25:14", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:16", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "25:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:17", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "25:18", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem ."}
{"timestamp": "25:24", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Like the chip is probably the most expensive part ."}
{"timestamp": "25:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "What does chip on print mean ?"}
{"timestamp": "25:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip ."}
{"timestamp": "25:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh-huh ."}
{"timestamp": "25:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "25:43", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Right ."}
{"timestamp": "25:45", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , yeah . Casing . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:47", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "25:51", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Case is what we were discussing yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "26:07", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Is there anything else we need to"}
{"timestamp": "26:10", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "26:11", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough ."}
{"timestamp": "26:17", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation ."}
{"timestamp": "26:29", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach ."}
{"timestamp": "26:34", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "26:34", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Cool ."}
{"timestamp": "26:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "See you soon ."}
{"timestamp": "26:39", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Does it matter that I end early ?"}
{"timestamp": "26:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "How how early is it ?"}

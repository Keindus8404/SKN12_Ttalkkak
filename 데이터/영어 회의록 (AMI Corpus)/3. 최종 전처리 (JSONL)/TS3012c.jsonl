{"timestamp": "29:50", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "No , I don't think because this is a zero . But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . Anyway , so this is the basic design , we wanna have um on and off what are we missing ?"}
{"timestamp": "29:53", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "30:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "probably think you want the curve to be here . So have your finger under here like this , I suppose ? Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "30:23", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , pretty much ."}
{"timestamp": "30:26", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Just gonna be sh"}
{"timestamp": "30:29", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "30:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Want this straight or what ? Let's keep it at this ."}
{"timestamp": "30:37", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it would be like this ."}
{"timestamp": "30:40", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Do we want something interesting with it or see ."}
{"timestamp": "30:51", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Should like this ?"}

{"timestamp": "30:58", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It can be curved ."}
{"timestamp": "30:58", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Why ?"}
{"timestamp": "30:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It can be curved , because that yeah , it's a little bit more trendy to be curved ."}
{"timestamp": "31:00", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yes ."}
{"timestamp": "31:03", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "It can be curved . Okay ? I think so . That's why I asked you ."}
{"timestamp": "31:11", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I would curve the whole actually ."}
{"timestamp": "31:14", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Hmm ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:15", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I would curve the whole . Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit ."}
{"timestamp": "31:19", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Oh crap ."}
{"timestamp": "31:21", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily ."}
{"timestamp": "31:25", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . Oh ."}
{"timestamp": "31:30", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Anyway , so you want to a little more like this ?"}
{"timestamp": "31:35", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yeah , something like that , yes ."}
{"timestamp": "31:36", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Uh-huh ."}

{"timestamp": "31:40", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yes , exactly ."}
{"timestamp": "31:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think continue like that ."}
{"timestamp": "31:46", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yep ."}
{"timestamp": "31:47", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Then there's also enough room for the electronics ."}

{"timestamp": "31:56", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "It's fruit . Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "31:57", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah , it's perfect ."}
{"timestamp": "31:59", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose ."}
{"timestamp": "32:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita ."}
{"timestamp": "32:23", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Have ourselves sponsored ."}
{"timestamp": "32:24", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita ."}
{"timestamp": "32:27", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it ."}
{"timestamp": "32:32", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "So it would give the buttons here ."}
{"timestamp": "32:33", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Or they can design their own cover ."}
{"timestamp": "32:35", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "We could set up a a marketing uh agreement ."}
{"timestamp": "32:35", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I suppose I suppose we can put um let's see ."}
{"timestamp": "32:37", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Yeah ."}
{"timestamp": "32:42", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Oh , perhaps they can use it ."}
{"timestamp": "32:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space , for example ."}
{"timestamp": "32:52", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ?"}
{"timestamp": "32:56", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm ."}
{"timestamp": "32:58", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip ."}
{"timestamp": "33:02", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think this is possible ."}
{"timestamp": "33:05", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Huh ."}
{"timestamp": "33:07", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "It doesn't matter . You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom , and and wire it . Doesn't matter ."}
{"timestamp": "33:12", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Okay , that's not a problem . Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "33:13", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Okay ."}
{"timestamp": "33:21", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "That's fine ."}
{"timestamp": "33:23", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yep . Blah ."}
{"timestamp": "33:25", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "I think we get the idea ."}
{"timestamp": "33:28", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um , any other com what what are we missing here ? Something a speech recognition . Um"}
{"timestamp": "33:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the or , for example , on top ? Like here ."}
{"timestamp": "33:38", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "Top ?"}
{"timestamp": "33:39", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Oh , basically the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 'Cause you can talk to it like this ."}
{"timestamp": "33:40", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "On there ."}
{"timestamp": "33:43", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think on top ."}
{"timestamp": "33:50", "speaker": "Speaker_D", "text": "No ."}
{"timestamp": "33:58", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "'Cause transmitter would be here ."}
{"timestamp": "33:59", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Well , the email said it was a quite a small component . So I don't see that ."}
{"timestamp": "34:12", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um yeah , it could be either be here or make a double microphone ."}
{"timestamp": "34:17", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Mm-hmm ."}
{"timestamp": "34:18", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I wouldn't mind ."}

{"timestamp": "34:29", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Uh the speaker sensor we already have , but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something ."}
{"timestamp": "34:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I think it can . I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either ."}
{"timestamp": "34:42", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "I think so , it I think it could ."}
{"timestamp": "34:46", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Yeah . I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , because you don't have to have a button for everything . You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . Think that would be fine . So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen ."}

{"timestamp": "35:22", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Um , so the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example ."}
{"timestamp": "35:30", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "At the back , yeah . Like that . Or at the side ."}
{"timestamp": "35:32", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Hmm ."}

{"timestamp": "36:14", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Hmm . Okay , I think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? So we're s supposed to be rubber . I think well , I think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . So we have the logo up there . So are we gonna base colour is black ?"}
{"timestamp": "36:19", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "Yes ."}

{"timestamp": "36:36", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever ."}
{"timestamp": "36:39", "speaker": "Speaker_C", "text": "I would change . I would take a yellow remote control . To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people ."}
{"timestamp": "36:43", "speaker": "Speaker_B", "text": "Yeah , but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base ."}
{"timestamp": "36:44", "speaker": "Speaker_A", "text": "Okay ."}
